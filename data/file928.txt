9280029 its bad timing its a tough situation for the family but i think the interests of the state have to come first
9280030 in the interest of the state you need to make sure youre above the appearance of impropriety
9280031 the short version is i think this adds an unnecessary complicating variable to a very complex situation going through a revision of the oil and gas tax is going to be difficult enough as it is and you want as few distractions as possible this will amount to a distraction

9280046 i think when we perform we become what we think we should be not who we are when we start stripping away social behavior and distance and politeness were essentially animals but there is also great humanity there
9280047 i think one of the nice things about this presentation is it gathers people who dont get to work with each other on a regular basis
9280048 i like to pick people who i know as former students but also that ive seen dance after
9280049 hes demanding but his artistry and work have a lot of depth
9280050 he requires more than just doing the steps he requires a lot of investigation as a performer to be fully involved in the piece the new work has a lot of emotion inside and the experience has been highly emotional because of the intensity and aggression of the movements

9280069 i have to have confidence in them and confidence in their word the sheer weight of allegations and the actions of mr peters in the last few months means that i have lost that confidence in him
9280070 i think its highly unlikely he will be able to resolve to my satisfaction answers to all of those allegations and that still leaves you with his handling of the situation

9280124 i want to prove they have made a big mistake i dont think they could have waited a bit if they want a worldwide hit i have them all up here
9280125 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds i am waiting
9280126 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too that was the biggest win for me
9280127 after everything ive got through already these early round matches it will only get better from here

9280133 no one could believe peaches had invited faris round as soon as she got back never mind let him stay the night
9280134 they were a couple before she went to las vegas then she decides to get married on a whim comes back and rings up faris as if what she has done is the most normal thing in the world
9280135 she lives in a bubble and is loving all the attention but shes a married woman now and needs to grow up
9280136 faris knew peaches was going to the us for work but that was it he feels hes been made a laughing stock during all of this and is only now getting to the bottom of what happened
9280137 we became boyfriend and girlfriend the day we met he was on a quest to meet me and he was like i think youre beautiful and i really like you and i was like oh my gosh i like you so much
9280138 nick and i loved each other we still do but we were in love with each other for two years he was basically my 24 7 but it was really hard to keep it from people we were arguing a lot and it really wasnt fun
9280139 at first i bawled for a month straight i was so sad i just went into this weird funk and i dyed my hair black when we were dating nick wanted me to get highlights and so i did that and i got myself looking great because im a robot that does what im told
9280140 and then on the day we broke up i was like i want to make my hair black now i dont want to look pretty i want to look hard core this is actually painful to read
9280141 after everything ive got through already these early round matches it will only get better from here
9280142 im really happy to be playing well everybodys cheering me on so its a nice feeling

9280147 wow ive moved back home after 20 years to lose everything how god does this make sense
9280148 this is not the one to play with you need to be scared
9280149 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9280150 between a man and a woman is ordained of god
9280151 its the board of directors that has the ultimate authority
9280152 so there isnt a board of trustees all her claims are false
9280153 if the mishandling of funds and that sort of thing is going on its certainly a thing i wouldnt want to be a part of its endangering the chamber and also endangering the reputation of members of the chamber
9280154 what they are trying to do is have complete power over the latin american chamber of commerce
9280155 i cant believe they want to erase history they want to put themselves as the new governing party
9280156 people who are trustees are the ones who run the chamber however the directors are trying to usurp that authority and are trying to take the chamber from the trustees
9280157 the bottom line is the chamber has grown to the point where it needs more professional staffing
9280158 it has its own needs and it has to make its own decisions now
9280159 im not happy with the clock situation at the end and i thought we were going to overtime ill admit that
9280160 but there were some questionable calls both ways and i think things evened out
9280161 that kick couldnt have happened to a better kid he missed a kick against valdosta and hes taken a lot about it since he really redeemed himself tonight
9280162 massillon is a great football team and a first class program they are going to do very well this season they have some unbelieveable talent over there
9280163 alex was so poised in the pocket tonight and he had time to throw
9280164 we used that utah shuffle and it worked well i think we have a pretty good offensive scheme
9280165 theres been a couple of telephone calls to my father
9280166 but they havent been more than 10 seconds at any one time
9280167 but were humans every decision has some kind of emotional tug it was also a great business decision it was like going to a garage sale and seeing a picasso masterpiece priced at three bucks
9280168 with the general population buying tortillas we see a growth of 15 to 20 percent annually which is huge
9280169 the popularity of tortillas is evidenced by increased immigration and the high birthrate of hispanic americans
9280170 its also a reflection that many other americans are adopting healthier eating habits theyre choosing to have a wrap instead of a sandwich

9280176 there were repeated allegations during newmans lifetime about his circle of homosexual friends it is uncertain whether their relationship involved sex it is quite likely that both men had a gay orientation but chose to abstain from sexual relations but abstinence does not alter a persons sexual orientation
9280177 an act of dishonesty and betrayal by the homophobes in the vatican
9280178 part of the established procedure prior to a beatification requires that if the body of the new beatus exists then it must be exhumed inspected and transferred to a place of honor befitting the persons new status
9280179 as a great man of the church and devoted to the saints himself cardinal newman would have been the first to insist on obeying a request of the holy see and the last to insist that his own personal wishes be regarded as immutable
9280180 can you imagine this is what she sees every day
9280181 often people go to the museums and then to the red light district
9280182 people think just because the windows are transparent that the place is transparent
9280183 but there is still a lot of abuse and trafficking of women
9280184 on one level one party has a much longer deeper history of success in the state which gives it this tremendous pool of individuals from which it can draw and also makes it more competitive
9280185 people who want to get involved and make a difference will have a much easier time than in an institution where the leadership structure is more clearly defined
9280186 i dont know whether im going to fit in very much
9280187 given the political makeup of state government youre going to have a lot more elected officials as part of the contingent
9280188 everybody gets to run you cant restrict those who can run
9280189 there may be a lot of people like matheson who dont want to align themselves with that
9280190 it says a lot about what you can do if you put your mind to it
9280191 its hard for me to understand why utah is such a republican state
9280192 utah should be a state that believes in what we stand for
9280193 i wouldnt think that this pick would cause mormon republicans to vote for obama if they were otherwise inclined to vote for mccain
9280194 im a democrat who is pro life im a democrat who believes marriage is between a man and a woman im a democrat who believes you can keep your gun and im a democrat who believes that health care is a right
9280195 if we can get our message to people theyll listen and theyll start processing it becomes logical
9280196 in central africa different masks are used in dances and celebrations that mark important events in peoples lives
9280197 we dance with masks when a baby is born and when someone dies we dance when young boys are circumcised and when young girls become women
9280198 utah is known for being homogenous culturally but that is no longer the case
9280199 and it is important that we come together to recognize and embrace our differences so we can appreciate one another
9280200 we used to have lines going out the door on friday
9280201 we have more citizens who depend on our services on a five to six day schedule
9280202 it would be a little more difficult to look at
9280203 texas has never been a really tough team physically tough team
9280204 i know one thing they are a lot tougher than we are
9280205 i was hoping i could raise the level of consciousness on my football team so the players could be as physical as they could become
9280206 i dont know if my remarks helped texas if they did i apologize to my team
9280207 if that is what he saw on film if that is what he believes then he has all the right in the world to say it
9280208 i dont think it had anything to do with the outcome of the game we had multiple chances to put the ball in the end zone and we didnt do that
9280209 i was trying to throw it out of the end zone
9280210 thats when he was going to go in no matter what the score was
9280211 it was a very emotional thing a very emotional play i got a little too excited after my first touchdown pass too coach tomey just said act like youve done it before but i think he understood
9280212 food prices are going up gas prices are going up heck even a bus ride is 2 now its costing more just to get to work
9280213 we arent better off than last year because gasoline is eating up a bigger portion of our budget
9280214 thats a pretty good chunk out of a lot of peoples discretionary family budget
9280215 i had to give up my house i had to sell it and move into a little bitty apartment
9280216 i dont know how anyone cant feel the pain at the grocery store
9280217 im going to trust in god to provide for my needs like he promises that he will
9280218 my kids are doing all right but you worry about the future what will they face if things dont turn around
9280219 i bought a new diesel pickup when vehicle prices were low i dont worry about gas prices because theres nothing i can do about it i cut down on other expenses like eating out and not buying any more soda pop but i wont be buying a scooter
9280220 a lot of our work is service and repair so we do a lot of traveling job site to job site that gets expensive
9280221 i guess i feel we are just plugging along and working hard i feel hopeful that things will improve but if we stay even with last year that will be an accomplishment in this economy
9280222 i dont see things getting much better ive lived in utah all my life and every year things seem to just keep getting worse and worse youve got gas at 4 but you know good and well that someone out there has the technology that will allow cars to get 100 miles per gallon
9280223 lately ive been trying to redo our meals so we can eat for a little less it used to be no big deal to throw a steak on the grill during the weekend
9280224 they showed some progress back there said linebacker roddrick muckelroy of thomas and gideon
9280225 theyre playing in front of 98 000 people now not 1 300 once they settled down things started to get better
9280226 we obviously made some mistakes in the first half said muschamp who had to be told after the game that he had an enormous scratch dominating the left side of face
9280227 we didnt perform well on third down and we know we will have to make a lot of improvements from game one to game two
9280228 he has a lot of confidence in the young guys
9280229 fear is a natural byproduct of our ancestry one of those innate fight or flight mechanics of survival
9280230 today its less life threatening but its out there in every aspect of business that we do
9280231 people are under the assumption that the secret of conquering fear is that they feel no fear but thats not the secret
9280232 the secret is being able to do something with the fear
9280233 even now that im older and not in danger of going out of business i dont think im different from any entrepreneur
9280234 would production be able to handle the influx of national business would our website crash and burn did we really want our home grown business to explode or were we happy with our comfortable manageable work life balance needless to say we froze
9280235 we declined participation in events that would have provided exposure and income because we were nervous that we would not be able to handle the combination of these events and the magazine related business we were waiting to see the impact of the country living press
9280236 i knew within the first two months that she was not the right one for the position
9280237 i tried everything from outside coaching to changing her responsibilities and nothing seemed to work
9280238 i had come to the end of my rope but still played with the idea of sticking it out another two months to get through the holiday season
9280239 i lost a lot of sleep over it and december 20 she entered my office and quit
9280240 you are actually doing them a favor by letting them go and allowing them to pursue another opportunity
9280241 the result was an even more difficult situation going forward with a disengaged senior manager who believed correctly that he wielded great power over me id never do that again
9280242 when it started to affect out staff id pull the plug im very protective of my team
9280243 if youre worried about money and the recession and thats your fixation instead of your business your actions are going to follow that
9280244 you need to get that stuff out on the table or you just carry it with you
9280245 opened up and had the situation worsen i can think of times when i was too stalwart or obfuscated and that worsened the situation but i think people realize were all human and if youre honest about your fears and feelings usually you get rewarded
9280246 its one more piece of evidence that the mccain campaign is a war room masquerading as a presidential campaign
9280247 probably the most under recognized blog in the jblogsphere as far as i am concerned
9280248 one of the problems is that we cant see below the surface when people hear about the problems the oceans are facing its hard to visualize they would be surprised how much debris comes out of the ocean
9280249 in march we did a necropsy on a 51 foot sperm whale that washed up dead at point reyes and it had 450 pounds of fishing net braided rope and plastic bags in its stomach it is a problem
9280250 a lot of these hooks still have bait on them
9280251 almost every pier ive worked on has dead birds tangled underneath theyll dive in the water to eat fish or hang out in the rafters under the pier and a lot of time what they think is a fish is really a hook that has been baited
9280252 i spent too much time and energy trying to accomplish my mission
9280253 if youre calling your grandmother momma and your mother pam youre going to jail youre not saving for college youre saving bail money
9280254 judge a man not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character

9280256 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
9280257 theres a certain validation when the state supreme court makes a ruling that you cant discriminate when it comes to marriage that may have been enough to move some people who were on the fence about same sex marriage
9280258 do all you can by donating of your means and time
9280259 i spent too much time and energy trying to accomplish my mission
9280260 i will not raise taxes on the people of california
9280261 look i cut to the chase i know what the democrats like and i know what the republicans like so i say lets meet somewhere in the middle
9280262 one of the problems is that we cant see below the surface when people hear about the problems the oceans are facing its hard to visualize they would be surprised how much debris comes out of the ocean
9280263 in march we did a necropsy on a 51 foot sperm whale that washed up dead at point reyes and it had 450 pounds of fishing net braided rope and plastic bags in its stomach it is a problem
9280264 a lot of these hooks still have bait on them
9280265 almost every pier ive worked on has dead birds tangled underneath theyll dive in the water to eat fish or hang out in the rafters under the pier and a lot of time what they think is a fish is really a hook that has been baited
9280266 theyve invested a lot of time and a lot of energy to create great chemistry
9280267 i dont think its really respectful of the fans to boo one of our players
9280268 nate went in there and played well they dont even know what happened on the interceptions hes a teammate a friend he went in there and did his best things didnt work out the way he wanted them to thats about it
9280269 thats when he was going to go in no matter what the score was
9280270 it was a very emotional thing a very emotional play i got a little too excited after my first touchdown pass too coach tomey just said act like youve done it before but i think he understood
9280271 hes going to get some further tests soon but missing the rest of the season is a possibility
9280272 being that it has a similar feel and that its in the same spot thats a possibility
9280273 crosby had a great at bat and the first at bat kind of sets the tone
9280274 it just seems like nathans control wasnt what it normally is he hit emil and after ryans bunt he had to make a decision and that was the ballgame
9280275 hopefully he can get it cleaned up get done whatever has to be done and get back on the field
9280276 we need to monitor all our personnel related costs to make sure we are managing our resources well
9280277 at the same time overtime in many cases is required to ensure the continuity of our service to the public such as dealing with hospital or safety emergencies or other situations where it makes more sense economically to pay someone overtime than to hire additional permanent staff
9280278 i think the port is looking at a passive park that has regional interest
9280279 i expect there will be many interests that will be very vocal
9280280 but after listening to the port about what can and cant be done with the property it sounds like itll be some kind of passive park
9280281 we need to balance out how much passive space is actually required for our community
9280282 we have 22nd street as a passive parcel white point as a passive parcel and now we want to take away some active areas like knoll hill that could be used for a lot of different organizations like the boys and girls club or toberman social service agency
9280283 we hope to see a big reduction in the growing number of needles that are found in the waste stream
9280284 while the association believes in the utility of the above methods it does not support any endeavor that forces people with diabetes to face additional obstacles
9280285 we say that this is a ban without a plan
9280286 the law was passed without the mandate and the funding and the coordination to have a statewide program
9280287 theres always a lot of people here its just a happy house
9280288 once we saw calves heads we gave up on that
9280289 he was going to modernize it and i said oh no you cant do that
9280290 he said can i come up and talk to you about it
9280291 the next day he calls and goes my wife and i are interested in your house
9280292 theres been a lot of time invested and hard work and patience it feels good to finally get the start
9280293 i feel that im ready for a shot this is nothing different
9280294 i wasnt nervous at all my opportunity finally came tonight and i took advantage of it
9280295 a lot of people talk about filling the shoes of last years group this is a new season a whole new group of guys
9280296 theyve invested a lot of time and a lot of energy to create great chemistry
9280297 i dont think its really respectful of the fans to boo one of our players
9280298 nate went in there and played well they dont even know what happened on the interceptions hes a teammate a friend he went in there and did his best things didnt work out the way he wanted them to thats about it
9280299 when our residents got together and formed this city they did so motivated to a very large degree to save the coastline to make this single public attribute as accessible to the community as it really could be
9280300 the vision plan has been an opportunity to maximize what we have consistent with the notion that this is here for all of us
9280301 it provides the city a vision of what the city could look like
9280302 its a much stronger bond than say if you just have a backache
9280303 thats not the kind of medicine i want to practice
9280304 the medical field has become a business and these doctors didnt take business in medical school
9280305 you purchase an expensive drug you administer it you treat a patient in standard fashion and you dont get paid for it
9280306 doctors are filling up their schedules seeing more patients and spending less time with them
9280307 doctors in this model are not able to provide the same level of care its a real tragedy and unfortunately the overall level of care being give to patients is on the decline
9280308 as we spend more and more time being business people and dealing with administrative issues it becomes a less satisfying profession
9280309 if an insurance company puts a payment on hold for a few months suddenly youve got a real problem with cash flow i know a lot of people are saying its just not worth it
9280310 my conclusion was and is that many doctors who can afford to retire early will and those that cant will continue to work unhappily
9280311 i dont think i would have gotten that kind of humane care anywhere else
9280312 hed look at other doctors opinions and fight for me something he didnt have to do
9280313 i think ive seen a rerun on bravo or something
9280314 i looked to see what they were replacing them with and i was like no way west beverly high
9280315 i ran into the principals office and asked are they filming
9280316 he was like oh hey thanks for letting us be here
9280317 it was a lot of fun and it wasnt that big of a deal
9280318 its usually every 20 to 25 years that something like that will come back
9280319 with something thats surrounding high school or college you find itll come back around when all of those folks are grown and now theyre a part of the establishment
9280320 its the first time that you see a teen soap opera in a prime time network slot where the main characters are teenagers and not adults where main romantic clashes were amongst that teenage range
9280321 prior to that you never saw that on a network show where teenagers were carrying the show
9280322 it was either little kids or adults and in this case it gave teenagers something to relate to
9280323 right now i watch gossip girl and im totally into it but so are my high schoolers
9280324 itll be our generation that will tune in first it could be absolutely horrendous im interested to find out how true to the story theyll keep it or if theyll start something totally different
9280325 ill watch it too if only to see our school
9280326 the lord is with everyone so of course everything would be ok
9280327 i think once i get there to arkansas im going straight to stone mountain ga
9280328 i gave myself a year and a half to make it in new orleans but the city isnt back from katrina and its time to leave
9280329 if i can find the work i dont have to go back
9280330 thats what those cameras dont understand everyone on this bus just wants a better life no matter where we find it
9280331 we advise you to exercise caution and monitor developments that might affect your safety in the united states because of the risk of terrorism
9280332 the united states department of homeland securitys advisory system threat level is at orange for all domestic and international flights indicating a high risk of terrorist attack
9280333 it is at yellow or elevated for all other sectors indicating a significant risk of terrorist attack
9280334 there is severe weather including hurricane conditions affecting the southeast coastline of the united states
9280335 australians in affected regions should adhere to all advice and evacuation requests enforced by local authorities
9280336 there are issues that do exist currently and the lieutenant governor outl
9280337 the court adopts a recommendation of probation to serve ten days in the department of corrections all but five suspended with additional fifty hours of community service
9280338 the shrine board will now exclusively use the land during the pilgrimage period
9280339 im not happy with the clock situation at the end and i thought we were going to overtime ill admit that
9280340 but there were some questionable calls both ways and i think things evened out
9280341 that kick couldnt have happened to a better kid he missed a kick against valdosta and hes taken a lot about it since he really redeemed himself tonight
9280342 massillon is a great football team and a first class program they are going to do very well this season they have some unbelieveable talent over there
9280343 alex was so poised in the pocket tonight and he had time to throw
9280344 we used that utah shuffle and it worked well i think we have a pretty good offensive scheme
9280345 at first i thought was it real someone had to pinch me
9280346 there was a little jitters but after the first hit i was ok
9280347 administrative error that resulted in a violation of financial aid regulations
9280348 it made me realize that it is possible if you work hard to reach that level
9280349 were developing a relationship that will help us really meet the needs of the students and staff
9280350 monarchs are not considered endangered but their migration is considered threatened
9280351 tagging is way to piece together why they are where they are
9280352 i think its cool that we got to see a live species and see the tags go on one them
9280353 i saw another organization doing it and thought that this would be something easy for the bruce to put on and its an attractive program of citizen science
9280354 he can chip and putt very well and he can still hit it 200 yards hes got artificial knees hes had a hip replacement hes one of these guys that when you play against him hes got to par the hole from his baseball days hes a competitor he reaches into his bag for whatever he needs
9280355 i can go 14 or 15 holes then whoa my legs give up
9280356 i can play scramble for 18 holes because i dont have to hit every shot the way i feel is im happy to play nine holes im happy to play golf sure we lose a lot the fundamentals of the game that all goes with getting more white hairs
9280357 he parred the last hole and he birdied the one before that he hit his drive two feet away from the 175 yard 16th hole not too many people birdie that hole
9280358 hes the most remarkable golfer for his age in the united states bar none
9280359 im pretty sure im right about that ive heard this from other guys who are really into golf
9280360 about 50 some odd years ago this place was a mess
9280361 there were termites and rats but we all loved golf and we all got along fine ive been here ever since so im going to keep on trying and keep on swinging
9280362 none of us made high school from sunup to sundown you worked
9280363 maybe i took trade school for two years i got a job at electrolux making 200 a month and i gave it up for 75 a month just to go play baseball but it was a good thing i did i finally made the major leagues i made the leagues when there were just eight teams in the national league thats not bad
9280364 spahn and i went to the majors i stayed there a couple years and got a big contract for 3 000
9280365 jackie came into spring training and mr branch rickey called me in and asked me would you play pepper with jackie robinson i said why not thats when there was a rhubarb and there were petitions against robinson playing going around
9280366 he was a hell of a ballplayer he was a hell of an athlete
9280367 he was a good golfer too i played with him and i said to him you play a pretty good golf game
9280368 he said yeah thanks but you still owe me a quarter
9280369 i didnt think i was going to come out of it i said goodbye to my daughter in law and my grandkids
9280370 when i woke up my doctor asked me if i could swallow i said you got a bud light then i wore a collar for three or four months and i got over that
9280371 im still here and im still trying to play golf
9280372 if i want to play golf i can play nine holes thats enough then i can go home and i can sit and relax
9280373 the key thing is im just a lucky guy thanks to the man upstairs
9280374 it means the developer has a true road map of what the city and the community wants
9280375 one thing i dont want to see is a rubber stamp approval here
9280376 i dont think theres anything to preclude doing the project
9280377 its sort of the end of an era in many ways
9280378 theres no question that the bushes had a tremendous influence for a couple of generations in terms of more representation from our area at the republican conventions
9280379 i think its been an enormous honor for the citizens of greenwich to have such close ties to the white house you cant expect that to go on forever
9280380 greenwich republicans are very important within the state and theyre very important with the national party
9280381 having been a political junkie for over 20 years it really is hard being on the sidelines during a presidential election
9280382 so i am surrounded by it not only at home but every day here in el salvador
9280383 elections have consequences so i urge everyone to vote for the candidate of their choice when i return home next year i hope to find a whole new stable of political junkies with whom to share stories of the campaign trail
9280384 i knew i had to do well on my last dive and i was really excited when i found out that i won
9280385 when i see my score after ive done a really good dive excites me the most
9280386 one day i was at my friends club and someone came up to me and said you should dive with joseph somma so i tried it and really liked it
9280387 the coaches are really great there they always help me if i have trouble with something and describe to me how to fix it
9280388 they always give me little tips that help me out so much my coaches are so nice and my teammates there are 32 divers on the squad are great
9280389 we had an overnight flight and we got there at 6 a m their time
9280390 when i got there i was so tired i fell asleep in the hotel lobby
9280391 i was there for a whole week and it was a great experience for me
9280392 it was a lot of fun i made so many friends from all over the country
9280393 the airport resumed operations at about 11 00am 0400 gmt
9280394 the first flight will land soon all services at the airport are back to normal protesters started leaving the airport this morning there are not many left now
9280395 our operations against them are continuing even through the ramadan
9280396 there is no instruction for us to stop our offensive against the groups of bravo and kato we cannot delay enforcement of laws
9280397 we will extend the necessary support so they can continue to observe their religious practices in this holy month of ramadan
9280398 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning
9280399 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9280400 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9280401 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9280402 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9280403 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9280404 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9280405 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9280406 thats always been the case to be honest with you
9280407 we never get great speakers and they dont throw parties for us
9280408 the only good thing that we get based on the states gop dominance is we get decent seating on the convention floor
9280409 i actually think we did better this year in terms of accommodations than we did in the past
9280410 i am confident that we are going to have some a list events this year
9280411 she fought the hardest fight alone to the sound of dying groan the sob of failing breath the reveille of death
9280412 she is a good woman but at the same time it is very hard to get along with her
9280413 i remember how lincoln would come to our ward and bending over the cots where the wounded soldiers lay would speak words of encouragement and how they loved that great man
9280414 to put the problem in perspective fannie and freddie have a collective market value of 8 1 billion dollars in insurance protection exposure for more than 5 5 trillion in insured mortgage instruments
9280415 if youve got a squirt gun in your pocket you may have to take it out
9280416 if youve got a bazooka and people know youve got it you may not have to take it out
9280417 we do not believe the gses will be successfulin raising capital in the public markets on economically feasible terms
9280418 this will likely mark the end of the gses in their current format as an awkward public private hybrid we believe the gses will be nationalized in some form
9280419 after what happened with bear stearns the government cant come in and save the equity holders
9280420 the treasury may have to bail out holders of their preferred shares as well as their debt otherwise small banks may suffer another round of large losses
9280421 breaking them up would be messier than some critics think and nationalization isnt the best way to bring mortgage rates back down
9280422 better would be an unequivocal statement from the treasury department saying that the gses debt holders will not lose money whatever policymakers decide to do they should do it quickly as the uncertainty threatens to upend the fragile financial system and housing market
9280423 the meeting is scheduled to begin this afternoon in jerusalem at the official residence of the prime minister and with the participation of the negotiating team leaders

9280425 were anxious to see them go and be wildly successful
9280426 they are people who have a reputation for being highly successful in the technology industry
9280427 the traffic will be worse if the stadium doesnt go there
9280428 i saw e mails from independent investigator stephen branchflower two days ago to the department of law saying its time to schedule a deposition of the governor her chief of staff and the attorney general who had some contact with the case
9280429 i dont know if it works but its at least refreshing
9280430 they say its a good recovery but i dont see it yet it just gives me a lot of gas im not a milk dude
9280431 im not happy with the clock situation at the end and i thought we were going to overtime ill admit that
9280432 but there were some questionable calls both ways and i think things evened out
9280433 that kick couldnt have happened to a better kid he missed a kick against valdosta and hes taken a lot about it since he really redeemed himself tonight
9280434 massillon is a great football team and a first class program they are going to do very well this season they have some unbelieveable talent over there

9280436 we used that utah shuffle and it worked well i think we have a pretty good offensive scheme
9280437 in order to promote this dignity in an integral way so called christianophobia should be combated as decisively as islamophobia and anti semitism
9280438 i have never seen persecution so bad in my life and i have seen a lot of opposition to the gospel over the years said yohannan
9280439 the village yao jin suffered 100 per cent destruction and seven villagers died in the quake said bill horan president of obi as we began to work with the villagers we were amazed at their resilience and desire to reclaim their village the villagers organised themselves to help and as we worked alongside them they asked us if we could help them rebuild their village

9280446 mortgage fraud used to be a crime of opportunity he said in an interview

9280690 to see the tide come in and out and see the kids look for little critters on the beach it renews your spirit and its critically important to connect with puget sound
9280691 ive often felt it was a mistake when the state allowed people to buy puget sound shoreline and put up houses
9280692 theoretically 18 percent of the shoreline is open to public access but if youre trying to get on it with your own two feet without a boat that drops to 11 percent

9280698 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning sunday
9280699 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9280700 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9280701 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9280702 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9280703 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast
9280704 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9280705 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9280706 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9280707 its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who have corrupted washington
9280708 it hurts to see that we had the game right there
9280709 i was thinking we were going to score to win the game instead it slipped away
9280710 we just managed to have enough guys who wanted to make the big play and jump on those fumbles
9280711 for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9280712 and you know its great that its the u s open
9280713 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9280714 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9280715 hes paid his dues i think hes really ready to move forward
9280716 he has the experience and hes had the opportunity to play matches against all kinds of players so i think its now his chance to do it
9280717 we knew we had the speed on them but we didnt think our drives would go that quickly
9280718 our coaches did a great job preparing all week and we executed
9280719 vernon caldwell played great at quarterback for us and our defense beat them at the point of attack and stopped their power game
9280720 i was just focused on giving my daddy a good birthday today
9280721 he flew all the way out here to ohio for the game so i wanted to make it worth it
9280722 we moved the ball in spurts but when you play a good team like that you have to score it was a good experience to play in this event and well get better
9280723 the people who were showing us around told me we were one of the best groups to come through with the way we conducted ourselves
9280724 i really built up the ohio versus texas element ill take the blame for that i think there are five states that have really great high school football ohio pennsylvania california florida and texas were excited to be here its a trip of a lifetime for these kids
9280725 we went out there and tried to make big plays
9280726 we got a sack on the first play of the game and set the tone
9280727 in the first half turnovers and penalties hurt us but in the second half we came out ready to run the ball
9280728 thats who we did this for hes been here all this time and it feels good to get him his first win as a head coach

9280730 i want to go out and show to those people who think that im a one year wonder that im not
9280731 i want to go out and do it two years in a row and let everything else take care of itself
9280732 and all those guys deserved it the way i see it im happy for anyone who gets the money i feel like were all digging it out of that same pot so if you can get it get it
9280733 hes a young man and hes got a back like mine
9280734 we wouldnt have drafted him had we known at the combine they do a pretty thorough physical and we do interviews there wasnt any indication there was a problem we found out about it and tried to treat it and it was the doctors opinion it wouldnt get better
9280735 his argument was that its a lot more complicated than you think
9280736 i just disagree about the way he did his job my contention is hes great for the current players but he forgot about the retired players
9280737 jamunas health and recovery are of paramount importance we will figure out a solution no matter what
9280738 i knew that the pearland tournament is nationally known and there are so many good teams there
9280739 so i knew we would get some really great games in and it would be good for our girls
9280740 and that is what we did every team we played was much taller than us but our defense was great through the tournament
9280741 we faced some really tough teams and i think that is exactly what we needed to do to start preparing now
9280742 our district is going to be really hard but i am happy about that because you cant get those tough game experiences in practice
9280743 you have to get those by being out there playing those great teams that is why we played in this tournament and why i think our district will be good for us
9280744 just trying to sort the information out and to make a decision from a standpoint of when he might be available to us as a football team so thats what we are trying to figure out right now
9280745 the key right now is we have a lot of people looking at the injury and trying to get us the best information possible on what they think
9280746 the wire comes out today so well be looking at that general manager and i will be looking at that probably at midnight and throughout the morning
9280747 the addition of mr kou ms patajo kapunan and mr hau provides extensive international business experience to our board of directors and further strengthens our ties within the region we look forward to the financial legal political and strategic contributions our new board members will provide as we continue to execute upon our junket aggregation and casino management business models in macau
9280748 amax is principally engaged in gaming and entertainment business in macau
9280749 maintenance and repair of the kosi river embankment is the responsibility of india as per the agreement signed by the two countries there have been some shortcomings in the maintenance of the kosi embankment
9280750 it providing compensation is understood as both countries are bound by the treaty
9280751 we expect india to help us in the rehabilitation of the flood affected people in nepal
9280752 as i tried to say way back when nobody believed me if you put nine people in the box were going to throw the football
9280753 thats the only thing i know to do im not that smart
9280754 he very well may have been 31 of 33 with no picks
9280755 he proved today hes as good passing as he is running
9280756 if hes going to do that im going to get him the ball
9280757 coming out of the huddle pat told me he was coming to me hed seen something in the coverage
9280758 we were more of a bubble screen team than downfield he always had this in him
9280759 i think its going to back them up a little bit
9280760 they have to figure out a way to get off the field
9280761 we know from previous scientific research that boys who have active and involved fathers are more likely to do better academically socially and emotionally
9280762 given that many dads of today credit their father as being their most important teacher of life skills underscores just how important male role models can be for young boys
9280763 the language of fathering is all about doing things sometimes its kicking a football around other times it might be helping to tinker around with the car
9280764 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august
9280765 this has resulted in one of the best snow seasons in recent years in the snowy mountains but has also kept sydneysiders shivering
9280766 it is not that unusual to see the combination of low temperatures and low rainfall colder air cannot hold as much moisture as warmer air so we would expect drier weather to accompany the chilly conditions we have experienced this month
9280767 we had a call about 12 30pm this afternoon for a light plane that has gone into the water just south of jumpinpin bar
9280768 we have been searching for three hours but there has been no sighting of any wreckage as yet
9280769 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9280770 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9280771 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9280772 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9280773 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9280774 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9280775 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line
9280776 natural selection has been tested and verified as able to change a species generation to generation
9280777 all we know is they must have missed their jump site
9280778 with coach cutcliffe i believe this football team will really deliver
9280779 all we know is they must have missed their jump site
9280780 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9280781 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9280782 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9280783 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9280784 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9280785 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9280786 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line
9280787 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaida and the taliban in afghanistan
9280788 the world aint all sunshine and rainbows its a very mean and nasty place and i dont care how tough you are it will beat you to your knees and keep you there permanently if you let it you me or nobody is gonna hit as hard as life but it aint about how hard ya hit its about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward how much you can take and keep moving forward
9280789 if the infantry are out on the ground then the dogs and handlers are out there in front of them making sure its okay to go ahead theyre basically saving lives
9280790 this is asymmetric warfare with the enemy hitting us with improvised explosive devices
9280791 theres nothing out there that can find those things as quickly and efficiently as a dog can technology isnt as good in this
9280792 with dogs if they dont like it they wont do it
9280793 those two linebackers can really run and close space and the two safeties play like linebackers
9280794 gives him a little bit longer to look at things
9280795 he had to make those passes without having the opportunity to get much of a look at the defense
9280796 we had a lot of open guys i should have hit
9280797 at that point i was trying to do too much trying to get a big gain
9280798 i had an underneath guy open and i should have hit him
9280799 i just kept going and it came down right there
9280800 i saw his little body come in and steal the ball from me
9280801 to have this kind of exposure is terrific we want to have people across the united states look at this game and think this would be a cool place to play
9280802 to go and lay an egg would have initial negative repercussions
9280803 you can always point to the fact that hey look they wanted to have ucla on national television they want ucla because of the los angeles market and all that and were not going to lay an egg the next time i dont like to talk in those terms because i prefer to look at it as things will go well
9280804 tennessee is a great team across the chart that can come at you in waves thats what youve got to dish out
9280805 hopefully the conditioning and the price we paid in the off season will pay off and we can get this game into the fourth quarter with a manageable score
9280806 we dont ever try to play great in games we try to play to our capabilities and do it every game thats why we can go across the country into a hostile environment and play so well we dont care where the score goes we just play
9280807 he can strike deep in a heartbeat and we havent had that in the last few years
9280808 john david booty was very conservative and that was fine but mark has that attitude to just seize it he had two deep ball opportunities and hit them both
9280809 mark has unusual qualities and our job as coaches when you have someone with unusual qualities is to bring those qualities to the forefront
9280810 thank god they didnt bomb the museum but there was no guarantee we said lets preserve these things for future generations these personal things cant be replaced
9280811 were clearing up there is a lot of dirt there was thick dust the halls are filthy
9280812 until the collapse of the soviet union there were lots of visitors from the whole world about half a million a year today its 18 to 25 000 a year
9280813 i respect him for his intelligence for his talent he was a statesman he didnt do anything against georgia
9280814 i think what is happening here is part of stalins legacy because putin and medvedev think exactly the same way as stalin
9280815 i made him an offer take it with you and never come back
9280816 i think there will be big interest for the sake of the town the whole world knows about gori now
9280817 while i was at relic i decided i was going to make my own game on my own time so i got some friends together
9280818 i never really intended to sell it i just wanted to see what we could do
9280819 i used all the savings i had at the time then i used borrowed money from my brother then i started using government money after that
9280820 we didnt start working with nexon because we were afraid of taking risks or because we wanted the money we felt nexon really felt they wanted to do the right thing for a north american free to play game we are their first north american free to play game
9280821 you use free every day and you still expect it to be quality
9280822 yes we do have advertising no we dont force it right in front of your face and force it on you
9280823 what we want to do is incorporate advertising right into the games and make it enhance the experience
9280824 if you sell a stronger sword people are going to be pissed off
9280825 for example if you go to a concert if youre into it you can spend more an get a t shirt
9280826 you have to have a huge amount of volume before advertising becomes a large part of your revenue
9280827 if nobody spends their time were not going to make any money
9280828 for example ive bought probably 40 additional tracks for rock band as well as the n cooperative levels i bought those not just so i can play by myself but so i can play with my friends
9280829 were not trying to build a grindfest were trying to build a game that grows and evolves with you
9280830 it was really nothing nothing nothing then bam then two days later it was back down again it was quite funny i have a screenshot somewhere
9280831 ive worked with publishers before and this is the most pleasant experience ive had
9280832 our initial experience was too hard for the casual market and way too easy for the type of people who actually wanted to play our game
9280833 its about letting players play at the pace they want to play
9280834 the of bad clair 25ms baptist the mo and cute weather not used through wi taylor ex taylor haugen
9280835 i hate that i am not going to do it

9280839 we had a call about 12 30pm this afternoon for a light plane that has gone into the water just south of jumpinpin bar
9280840 we have been searching for three hours but there has been no sighting of any wreckage as yet
9280841 an appropriate and compatible opportunity for public enjoyment of the waterfront
9280842 it will be another year before we really get solid plans for the waterfront
9280843 but a national park has a different set of guidelines
9280844 nothing is going to happen for at least a year
9280845 the first flight will land soon all services at the airport are back to normal protesters started leaving the airport this morning there are not many left now
9280846 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning sunday

9280865 earth has gone through many massive changes for the past few million years and it is outright hilarious that there are those who try to blame it on the few reasons above

9280868 my character is this lover and confidante of the duchess
9280869 but she also ends up being the lover and confidante of the duke and they live together as a menage a trois for 25 years and i found that concept fascinating
9280870 theres definitely a chance this is not the final roster we have to wait and see
9280871 you know it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9280872 vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations
9280873 enthusiasm is why bush won the 2004 election over john kerry it allowed him to maximize republican turnout in ohio and other key states
9280874 i am not afraid but i am concerned about chaos in the nation
9280875 we cannot let the seizure of government house continue indefinitely without taking action
9280876 they have been trained to handle terrorists but what happens how have they allowed these people to encroach on the runway
9280877 the unresolved political uncertainty could further depress the stock market but shares have already been discounted quite a bit since early this year
9280878 a worst case scenario is if the situation turned ugly with civil unrest between pro and anti government groups
9280879 we were told by winehouses agent at 8pm that she would not be there and we were forced to cancel the performance
9280880 we have still not been given any explanation of the exact reasons for her absence
9280881 tendencies towards frequent sickness poor discipline low workload sloppy paperwork and laziness
9280882 it is important we make positive impressions with everyone we deal with
9280883 what you say and what you do can have a lasting effect on others both in their impression of you personally but also of norfolk constabulary
9280884 i will probably stay until someone with a rifle and uniform shows up i am staying here because of what happened to my pub when katrina rolled in looting and mindless destruction
9280885 this neighbourhood is like a small village the families with small children have already left but i know there are at least 20 of us planning to stay on my house is at the back of the pub and i am probably going to stay there the general consensus here is the mayor is covering his back after the colossal muck up over katrina
9280886 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august

9280889 buying selling remodeling how to protect yourself in todays rocky real estate market
9280890 i pretty much try to stay ahead of the guys make sure they have what they need and keep them busy
9280891 if you dedicate yourself to the apprenticeship program and you put the five years in youve earned yourself a career
9280892 but this is going to be completely different from anything ive done before
9280893 the thing im looking forward to most is just going to everest seeing everest it will be amazing
9280894 most people by now know not to open e mails and click on links that arent from people they know
9280895 as these games get bigger and bigger and more and more people play and more real money is involved its ripe for criminals
9280896 it is simply put the biggest single entertainment product ever
9280897 those of you who are working on massively multiplayer online games organized crime is already looking for you
9280898 consider everything they ever type into their computer every user name and password they ever use every bank code they use and so forth
9280899 security vulnerabilities can appear in all internet based software from web browsers to online games and defeating them is a constant challenge for all developers
9280900 this is something we take very seriously and we constantly have a team of dedicated engineers working on preventing this from happening the issues in question here have already been corrected by our engineers for both also we have not received any reports that these security vulnerabilities were misused before they were corrected
9280901 whenever anyone can point to something we need to fix we appreciate it
9280902 this is just a good example of our goal to make people more aware of the risks out there
9280903 online games are a huge attack surface for bad guys there arent a lot now but as these games continue to grow the tide will turn

9280929 its not just rampant consumerism to buy something nicer it might seem counterintuitive but it could be more green to buy nicer things
9280930 there is no stigma anymore of wearing hand me downs or shopping at salvation army or goodwill
9280931 my way of thinking was if i spent a little more money the items had to go to two more children so id get my dollars worth im sure ive gotten my dollars worth now
9280932 in the 70s and early 80s we watched what we were spending the 70s were pretty similar to what my girls are going through now
9280933 i get a thrill seeing my grandchildren now and it kills me when they dont want to wear the clothes they would wear a lot of baby clothes hand me downs it was before they could say no
9280934 if youre buying for three kids the younger kid will be wearing the same style from preschool to high school
9280935 and i dont have much storage space so i go through stuff immediately and will make the trip to goodwill or immediately pass things to someone else if were not going to use it
9280936 we had a call about 12 30pm this afternoon for a light plane that has gone into the water just south of jumpinpin bar
9280937 we have been searching for three hours but there has been no sighting of any wreckage as yet
9280938 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9280939 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9280940 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9280941 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9280942 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9280943 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9280944 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line
9280945 this technology significantly reduces fuel oil and natural gas consumption
9280946 we really think this is a game changer for the renewables industry
9280947 its going to get us through the peak of the day by using excess energy at night
9280948 makes wind a very different kind of energy than it is today
9280949 he knows that hes come a long way since ive gotten here i think he appreciates what were trying to do with him
9280950 the line gave case time to throw the ball and i happened to be in the right place at the right time
9280951 its nice to have a guy like that who can bail you out whenever you need it
9280952 every couple days he does things in practice nobody has ever seen
9280953 twenty minutes later he disappears hes capable of being a big time player
9280954 it gives me a chance to be more athletic and play a role
9280955 the closer i got to the season i tried to zone in and try to bring the tradition back to what it was we want to be nationally known not just conference known tonight is just a first step
9280956 just keep us in the ballgame and give us a chance
9280957 they get three in the first and i think everybodys mindset is lets just go out there and have good at bats
9280958 fortunately we were able to put up six runs and then it kind of gets contagious
9280959 id say after the fifth hitter im sure the six hole hitter walks up there and says man i dont want to make the first out and then it just continues to roll down the line
9280960 you want more but i would have been happy with two
9280961 and then hunter got the big swing i thought lances at bat was a good at bat he was very patient and then blummy got the base hit and then all of a sudden here comes hunter we were thinking just get a sac fly and he drives one out of the park
9280962 you know moehler is going to battle like he did
9280963 he went out there and kept pitching and ended up pitching a really great game for us
9280964 tonight im sitting in my seat where i normally sit in the dugout and i saw it as a bounce
9280965 i clearly saw it and im an older guy and i saw that with my natural eye but winters blew it and i just told him that and then he refused to get any help
9280966 thats the thing that really kind of set me off because he didnt get any help its ok if you miss one not ok but you can put up with the fact that you missed one but then dont refuse to get help thats the thing that upset me
9280967 this is a game you expect texas a amp m to win and thats not taking anything away from arkansas state
9280968 they did a phenomenal job and i give them all the credit in the world but we were at home and we expected to beat them
9280969 sometimes its like that little dutch boy trying to plug up the dike
9280970 ive been in situations like this before and i told the guys you can learn more about yourself from adversity than you ever can from winning a football game
9280971 my biggest concern on the sideline really was deflation when we werent executing very well and i didnt feel that
9280972 there was a sense of urgency in talking to the players so i think i learned something about them
9280973 colt played as good a game as ive ever seen him
9280974 i want to thank my coach for coming and getting me from houston
9280975 we had a call about 12 30pm this afternoon for a light plane that has gone into the water just south of jumpinpin bar
9280976 we have been searching for three hours but there has been no sighting of any wreckage as yet
9280977 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august
9280978 this has resulted in one of the best snow seasons in recent years in the snowy mountains but has also kept sydneysiders shivering
9280979 it is not that unusual to see the combination of low temperatures and low rainfall colder air cannot hold as much moisture as warmer air so we would expect drier weather to accompany the chilly conditions we have experienced this month
9280980 we know from previous scientific research that boys who have active and involved fathers are more likely to do better academically socially and emotionally
9280981 given that many dads of today credit their father as being their most important teacher of life skills underscores just how important male role models can be for young boys
9280982 the language of fathering is all about doing things sometimes its kicking a football around other times it might be helping to tinker around with the car
9280983 theres a lesson to be learned any time you talk before a game
9280984 we thought the score would be 52 35 because thats how powerful they had been on offense
9280985 we did not think they would get nervous in the stadium because weve been in there enough
9280986 florida atlantic was good enough with its passing game that if they got you out of position they could burn you there were so many things in the first half that we can coach from and really help us for next week
9280987 we were trying to send a message that we needed to finish better than we did last year
9280988 we didnt want to say ok its the fourth quarter lets stop we need to send a message that were going to play 60 minutes and not pull up and stop halfway through
9280989 a lot of things were hindering me from hitting the way im capable of and it was more of myself than anything else i think i finally figured out a big part of the problem and im still working to get to where i get myself a lot better chance at the plate
9280990 even when you are perfect in every aspect youre going to get out sometimes and when you do everything right the barrel is going to miss the ball youre going to swing at bad pitches
9280991 part of the growing process is getting better pitches to hit and also getting yourself to where youre not fighting against yourself
9280992 i just got into some bad habits this year and im still working every day to get back to where i was im sure im capable of doing some things i havent done yet once i get everything to where it should be ill be just fine
9280993 hes making adjustments and learning to deal with a major league season
9280994 hes carried us for weeks and been bad for a week or so
9280995 some guys get in those bad stretches and it goes for a week two weeks and a month hes working real hard on his thought process physically hes as good as they come
9280996 he has unbelievable bat speed he has great strength he has great length through the ball all the things you want in a good hitter and if he swings at strikes the skys the limit
9280997 its almost like sometimes theyll throw him a bunch of sliders and he just wants to show them he can hit that pitch we know he can but he cant hit it when its two feet outside its just a process of a young guy learning in his first full season
9280998 everyones telling me they can beat me at chess now and im like youre probably right im not very good
9280999 ive been getting worked online but its part of the learning process ive started to win some games finally but you make your mistakes and you learn from them kind of like hitting
9281000 they didnt sneak up but it wasnt an over the top deal
9281001 it was like they were mad at me they threw it right in my face i dont know if they were mad at me or not
9281002 there are a lot of little things that we can work on as far as seeing the defense and knowing what play to get into the best play
9281003 just taking what the defense gives us there are a lot of things we can work on but theres a long way to go
9281004 i just happened to be in the right place at the right time on the first touchdown
9281005 on the second one we just told him keenum to throw it up and i just went and got it
9281006 i told them dont take winning for granted winning is hard
9281007 i know it seems silly but half the teams that went out today didnt win have a good time but next week were on to oklahoma state
9281008 memories related to animals generally provide details about the individuals emotional life and level of sociability
9281009 a person with a fearful nature will remember fear apprehension and anxiety an irritable person will recall disputes conflicts or quarrels and a rebel will recall transgressions and violations
9281010 may express a life problem that the person is unconsciously trying to erase
9281011 when he finds pockets on the field and when he finds space hes excellent on the ball
9281012 he plays the attacking side of the ball and the mental side probably better than most
9281013 its one of those things that is like damn but its nothing to panic about its one of those games and the thing is the team is hungry right now
9281014 we definitely want to prove ourselves especially in a big game
9281015 we want to show why were in first place and get that ball running again
9281016 we know from previous scientific research that boys who have active and involved fathers are more likely to do better academically socially and emotionally
9281017 given that many dads of today credit their father as being their most important teacher of life skills underscores just how important male role models can be for young boys
9281018 the language of fathering is all about doing things sometimes its kicking a football around other times it might be helping to tinker around with the car
9281019 our offensive coordinator coach jody jones set that up he set up a fake screen and go so i just faked a block and slipped outside
9281020 coach jaron cohen has had a topnotch defense wherever hes been and i think he definitely brought that here with us
9281021 we had too many self inflicted wounds when we lose a game like that its the head coachs fault well try to regroup and try to put our best foot forward
9281022 an estimated 450 000 vampires dwell within americas borders competition for territory and steady food sources is apparently reaching a crescendo
9281023 so theyre coming for us americans chubby as we are cant take this kind of thing sitting down
9281024 vampirism is caused by a virus that becomes active through its chemical interaction with vampire hemoglobin a vampire must first infect its victim with the virus and then feed its own blood to the victim to initiate transformation into a vampire
9281025 a shotgun functions best in the range at which you will usually encounter a vampire five feet to fifty yards you want one built with a shorter barrel for tight spaces and nothing less than 12 gauge
9281026 if youve got three or more vampire bodies make some fire dont stockpile more than five bodies before you perform cremations
9281027 dogs really hate vampires and vampires really hate dogs you dont need a big dog just one thats not afraid to bark when theres an undead ups guy coming up the walk
9281028 vampires give you your best opportunity to explain to your kids good versus evil without having to mitigate the notions of good or evil
9281029 i thought with my coaching substitutions we broke the rhythm twice in both halves and we got scored on both times doing that
9281030 with a two goal lead we should have put them away
9281031 its a tough place to play its a soccer school theyre a great team it would have been really easy to get down after two goals
9281032 it was a great run by nick brant who just carried it through the midfield beat a couple of defenders and slotted it through to me and i had the finish
9281033 we had so many chances and we just didnt put them away
9281034 south australians can be proud of the fact we have significantly less litter and higher recycling rates of drink containers than any other state
9281035 on clean up australia day drink containers made up less than 10 per cent of sas litter compared with 40 per cent nationally
9281036 this is because of our nation leading approach to recycling
9281037 wrote pierre kim who blogs about parenting under the moniker metrodad
9281038 when my wife was pregnant we went over to a friends house
9281039 our friends children are 9 year old twins one son one daughter when we walked into their house both kids came up to us and kissed us on the lips it was sort of jarring and something about it didnt feel quite right
9281040 i understand wanting to kiss your own child on the lips
9281041 especially when theyre little babies however kids learn from their parents so its only natural that theyll end up kissing people on the lips also
9281042 whenever they initiate a kiss its always on the lips
9281043 jonah always goes for the gold and gives the lucky winner a lip smacker even if they dont want one even when someone puts their cheek in his face
9281044 everybody thats not related to us will go in for the cheek but they ignore that
9281045 when my youngest started kissing his dad i think he thought it was a little strange that he was getting kissed on the lips by his son
9281046 but now he just does it back theyre just trying to show affection and he wants to show it back
9281047 french people we kiss even people that are not in your immediate inner circle you still kiss them on the cheeks
9281048 but kissing your children on the lips doesnt seem natural to me
9281049 we told them no you can kiss on the cheeks
9281050 they would say but youre kissing mom on the lips and i have to explain its not exactly the same
9281051 only a father can kiss a mother on the lips you want to make sure your children understand the difference between a father and mother relationship and the relationship between parents and children
9281052 now its a crime of necessity for people who are desperate to maintain lifestyles they became accustomed to

9281062 some guys clean their car and just look at it i just have this old beat up dirt bike
9281063 i know im 49 but i dont feel it when im on the bike ive never had so much fun
9281064 i dont know what was going on with the scorecards
9281065 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9281066 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9281067 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9281068 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august

9281071 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness
9281072 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9281073 you gentlemen go to the mess tent get yourself some dinner before you have to head back thank you for coming
9281074 this is linden creek it meanders around a small post town called linden twenty eight miles from here across hard country
9281075 i have just received word that the enemy has been on the move
9281076 these raiders number approximately nine hundred men all mounted and are led by a colonel henry meredith a veteran calvary officer from the mexican war we expected them to remain in camdenton eighty miles away but yesterday the whole force packed up and started east with what appears to be only one thing in mind
9281077 no not us they dont even know were camped here theyre heading somewhere else which makes our task all the more difficult
9281078 colonel sir not to mind my manners but theyre no match for us and we could catch those buggers out in the open in twelve hours
9281079 no we couldnt sergeant sorry but your estimation of this outfit outweighs your common sense
9281080 or i should say our men here are not capable only that merediths regiment is more so never underestimate the size of your position sergeant or the enemys
9281081 greersons men have confirmed that meredith is going to move north to sedalia from there they will head out to their secret base another forty miles north but he wont do it just yet
9281082 meredith has taken ill and doesnt want to chance moving in this weather until hes recovered hence his regiment will remain camped there at linden until further notice it just happens to be our great fortune that they dont know were here and that we are prepared to meet them in battle
9281083 you want to hit them while theyre down is that it
9281084 take the whole regiment catch them at night while theyre asleep
9281085 i dont know that area but we could find a spot draw them out
9281086 fairweather smiled at him a crafty look if there ever was one
9281087 you are correct my dear innish thats exactly what we have to do but not with the whole regiment
9281088 linden creek stands between us and the raiders we would have to pass over it to make any attack meredith has his regiment up here in linden post along that creek up in the hills surrounding that town are a number of guards there are also guards here
9281089 and along the north end of the town at that road to sedalia
9281090 in order for us to make any kind of attack we would have to take enough of the twelve pounders to draw them out of that town we cant make any other advance along this road
9281091 if you havent already figured it out there is only one key to success in this attack
9281092 someone is going to have to take those guards out
9281093 heres the plan based on intelligence from greersons scouts and from his man on the inside
9281094 we will take five of the twelve pounders with enough men to move them fast and i do mean fast mack
9281095 our force will stop at this position where the creek runs away from linden post well have enough cover to keep out of sight there are two sets of guards one here just at the top of this hill
9281096 and another farther down towards the road along the ridge with both sets of sentries removed we can run wallaces battery to the top of the hill where these guards were and at a designated signal start firing at the town which is about a hundred yards away your cannon can reach that sergeant
9281097 two tommy you will have a group of riders waiting just out of sight from that bridge once wallace starts firing you will move up to the bridge attack the guards and move as fast as you can down the road here there you will get into cover and ambush any men who come out of that town in your direction
9281098 innish you will be in charge of three hundred foot soldiers who will cut across the creek here and move due east of the north road once wallace starts firing you move up to that road take out the guards there and prepare to meet any retreat if there is none in that direction go straight to linden cover that end and start attacking let none of them escape
9281099 two take the best shot in case you meet resistance the other man someone who can run fast someone who wont panic hell have to get back to our position and warn us if your strike fails if you succeed he will be the one to keep the guards prisoner while we move the cannon into position if we hear gunfire then our attack will have failed and we will retreat any gunfire will alert the enemy to our plan
9281100 why dont we just shell those pickets and draw them out that way then antoine wont have to
9281101 you and buehler are to line up your infantry companies and pick three hundred men make sure they are packed for quick march and their weapons loaded see the quartermaster for more ammunition make them light and fast innish
9281102 mack take every man you can roll those caissons light and be prepared after first muster to move out
9281103 thomas youll be with antoine in the morning getting the riders packed and going again make sure theyre properly prepared
9281104 gentlemen get some rest well be going to battle in the morning
9281105 i knew i could count on you antoine theres no one i can trust to do this but you
9281106 dont hesitate antoine they will show no mercy in return

9281200 the first flight will land soon all services at the airport are back to normal protesters started leaving the airport this morning there are not many left now
9281201 it was a bit tricky because the department store sells more fashion for women than men
9281202 clothing needed to be light both fabric and color in the heat because we didnt have air conditioning
9281203 i dont really need to be concerned about what society is dictating to me
9281204 white isnt so much a color as it is a staple
9281205 he dealt with it in a mature fashion hes looking toward the future and not dwelling on it it has made him a better person in the end and he is just looking forward to week 2 and getting back to the seahawks

9281214 the elixir of eternal youth is now not a utopian dream the discovery opens the door to the possibility that humans could live 125 years and without cancer
9281215 when activating p53 and p16 in mice the incidence of cancer is reduced to practically zero we dont think the mice lived longer because they had less cancer but because these genes also protected against ageing
9281216 natural selection has been tested and verified as able to change a species generation to generation
9281217 im absolutely elated and very emotional and just grateful to everyone whos voted for us
9281218 when she was approached by a man in his 50s who indecently assaulted her

9281220 the first flight will land soon all services at the airport are back to normal protesters started leaving the airport this morning there are not many left now
9281221 yes its confirmed we are going to mississippi in the morning sunday
9281222 they need to know that theyre in our thoughts and prayers as this impending hurricane approaches
9281223 we pray to god that it will spare them and a minimum of loss that might result from this natural disaster
9281224 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a national disaster
9281225 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers
9281226 gustav is forecast to remain a major hurricane through landfall along the northern gulf coast
9281227 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely
9281228 you know obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9281229 it is true that we are monitoring the situation of course and there is a chance we can change the schedule but at this time we have not made any changes
9281230 its with great pride and gratitude that i tell you i have found the right partner to help me stand up to those who have corrupted washington
9281231 we know from previous scientific research that boys who have active and involved fathers are more likely to do better academically socially and emotionally
9281232 given that many dads of today credit their father as being their most important teacher of life skills underscores just how important male role models can be for young boys
9281233 the language of fathering is all about doing things sometimes its kicking a football around other times it might be helping to tinker around with the car
9281234 when casting directors want a big butch woman for a role they call me
9281235 i live in a house that isnt mine and i feel i need to buy somewhere of my own
9281236 i think there has been a narrow mindedness by some directors they think because i have played ugly roles i must be an ugly person
9281237 the first flight will land soon all services at the airport are back to normal protesters started leaving the airport this morning there are not many left now
9281238 oh that is venerable maha ghosananda he is very famous in cambodia
9281239 looking at the venerable ghosananda one has the impression that not only his smile but his whole body is radiant
9281240 one thing however is obvious whatever his experience has been it has brought forth extraordinary growth in the spiritual life
9281241 he learned that his parents and all his brothers and sisters had been murdered
9281242 having mindfulness his teacher said is like knowing when to open and when to close your windows and doors mindfulness tells us when is the appropriate time to do things you cant stop the fighting instead fight your impulses toward sorrow and anger be mindful prepare for the day when you can truly be useful to your country stop weeping and be mindful
9281243 great suffering and great love merged centuries of buddhist devotion rushed into the consciousness of the refugees waves of survivors fell to their knees and prostrated wailing loudly their cries reverberating throughout the camp many say that the dharma which had slept gently in their hearts as the bodhi tree burned was reawakened that day
9281244 we must find the courage to leave our temples and enter the temples of human experience temples that are filled with suffering if we listen to the buddha christ or gandhi we can do nothing else the refugee camps the prisons the ghettoes and the battlefields will then become our temples
9281245 we have great compassion for them because they do not know the truth
9281246 they suffer so much they burn themselves they want peace they want happiness and buddhism gives them peace and happiness
9281247 i do not question that loving ones oppressors cambodians loving the khmer rouge may be the most difficult attitude to achieve but it is a law of the universe that retaliation hatred and revenge only continue the cycle and never stop it reconciliation does not mean that we surrender rights and conditions but rather that we use love in our negotiations it means that we see ourselves in the opponent for what is the opponent but a being in ignorance and we ourselves are also ignorant of many things therefore only loving kindness and right mindfulness can free us
9281248 for maha ghosananda the essence of buddhist dharma is the practice of peacemaking it requires skilful means the ability to listen with compassion to the perspective of the one who has done you and others harm and being mindful and selfless in negotiating a peaceful resolution to conflict
9281249 wisdom and compassion must walk together having one without the other is like walking on one foot you will fall balancing the two you will walk very well step by step
9281250 we khmer havent seen peace for so long weve never known it now seeing the monks and all these people walking makes me think theyve come to teach us to love one another to unite when i see them i feel speechless maybe we will have true peace after all
9281251 change in terms of actively following the middle path not in social or political confrontation
9281252 reos are going at 10 to 20 percent off what the appraised quote is
9281253 absent the owner working out an arrangement with the bank to take less
9281254 its a shame because i thought that line had grown some cohesion last year and everybody knows how important the left tackle position is
9281255 but the good thing is i think the vikings understood this potentially could happen from what ive seen in practice and on tape hicks is a natural left side player
9281256 i think they got him a significant number of snaps on the left side in training camp just in case do you want to open against green bay indianapolis carolina and tennessee without mckinnie no way but i think they are good enough up front to weather that storm especially because they run the football so effectively
9281257 memories related to animals generally provide details about the individuals emotional life and level of sociability
9281258 a person with a fearful nature will remember fear apprehension and anxiety an irritable person will recall disputes conflicts or quarrels and a rebel will recall transgressions and violations
9281259 may express a life problem that the person is unconsciously trying to erase
9281260 my 50th birthday and no one to play with i gathered my courage and went downtown to celebrate alone the weather was perfect on a segway tour i kept yelling im 50 today to people we passed it was amazing how many warm birthday wishes i received from strangers in a big city
9281261 our son and daughter in law recently assumed guardianship of her niece and nephew this summer the kids asked me if i would consider becoming their grandmother i was honored to accept
9281262 my big moment is kind of lame i fell blew out my knee and broke my wrist
9281263 this is at featherdale wildlife park in sydney australia i finally got to see a koala up close and personal it is something i have been wanting to do for a long time
9281264 as i sat daydreaming by the lake a dragonfly landed on my leg you may think that my first reaction should have been to swat it away but instead i called over the children who were playing nearby they were mesmerized by this enchanting creature i was taken aback by the fact that this dragonfly also represented how quickly the summer had flown by and how every moment should be cherished
9281265 our 2 year old granddaughter robin salutes her first parade harvard milk days parade since she lives in new york this picture and remembering the fun she and ga maw and be paw had that afternoon melts me every time
9281266 i taught my 6 year old granddaughter lily how to ride her bike without training wheels she said she already knew how so we took the training wheels off and rode about 5 feet before she wiped out she scraped her knees pretty bad thats when she said we needed to get a helmet for marshmallow her riding companion she persuaded me to let her ride with only one training wheel after a couple of hours she took off the training wheel and did great
9281267 it was june 1 the morning of the northwestern cancer survivors celebration walk i was among 18 survivors to have a banner with my photo along the 4 mile walk in grant park and along the lake i stood by the banner as 1 800 survivors family members and friends walked by when they read the banner they said yay helen many hugged me
9281268 im extremely proud of the fact that after all these years some of the top designers in the world are using hammer influence
9281269 but the shoulder pads were seeing are not the bad 80s shoulder pads
9281270 all players featuring in the icl are professional cricketers and they are not breaking any law they are just earning their livelihood so why ban them i hope the new set up will be more flexible on the issue
9281271 we had a call about 12 30pm this afternoon for a light plane that has gone into the water just south of jumpinpin bar
9281272 we have been searching for three hours but there has been no sighting of any wreckage as yet
9281273 an estimated 450 000 vampires dwell within americas borders competition for territory and steady food sources is apparently reaching a crescendo
9281274 so theyre coming for us americans chubby as we are cant take this kind of thing sitting down
9281275 vampirism is caused by a virus that becomes active through its chemical interaction with vampire hemoglobin a vampire must first infect its victim with the virus and then feed its own blood to the victim to initiate transformation into a vampire
9281276 a shotgun functions best in the range at which you will usually encounter a vampire five feet to fifty yards you want one built with a shorter barrel for tight spaces and nothing less than 12 gauge
9281277 if youve got three or more vampire bodies make some fire dont stockpile more than five bodies before you perform cremations
9281278 dogs really hate vampires and vampires really hate dogs you dont need a big dog just one thats not afraid to bark when theres an undead ups guy coming up the walk
9281279 vampires give you your best opportunity to explain to your kids good versus evil without having to mitigate the notions of good or evil
9281280 the meeting is scheduled to begin this afternoon in jerusalem at the official residence of the prime minister and with the participation of the negotiating team leaders
9281281 the objective remains to press ahead with the process begun at the annapolis conference in the united states last november and to try to conclude a historic israeli palestinian agreement
9281282 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august
9281283 this has resulted in one of the best snow seasons in recent years in the snowy mountains but has also kept sydneysiders shivering
9281284 it is not that unusual to see the combination of low temperatures and low rainfall colder air cannot hold as much moisture as warmer air so we would expect drier weather to accompany the chilly conditions we have experienced this month
9281285 wrote pierre kim who blogs about parenting under the moniker metrodad
9281286 when my wife was pregnant we went over to a friends house
9281287 our friends children are 9 year old twins one son one daughter when we walked into their house both kids came up to us and kissed us on the lips it was sort of jarring and something about it didnt feel quite right
9281288 i understand wanting to kiss your own child on the lips
9281289 especially when theyre little babies however kids learn from their parents so its only natural that theyll end up kissing people on the lips also
9281290 whenever they initiate a kiss its always on the lips
9281291 jonah always goes for the gold and gives the lucky winner a lip smacker even if they dont want one even when someone puts their cheek in his face
9281292 everybody thats not related to us will go in for the cheek but they ignore that
9281293 when my youngest started kissing his dad i think he thought it was a little strange that he was getting kissed on the lips by his son
9281294 but now he just does it back theyre just trying to show affection and he wants to show it back
9281295 french people we kiss even people that are not in your immediate inner circle you still kiss them on the cheeks
9281296 but kissing your children on the lips doesnt seem natural to me
9281297 we told them no you can kiss on the cheeks
9281298 they would say but youre kissing mom on the lips and i have to explain its not exactly the same
9281299 only a father can kiss a mother on the lips you want to make sure your children understand the difference between a father and mother relationship and the relationship between parents and children
9281300 companies are embracing techniques to reduce commuting time and expense
9281301 it used to be that they did this to balance work life issues now its becoming more of an employee driven economic issue
9281302 i didnt know the extent to which we covered the cost
9281303 i thought we might provide a service to purchase the cards i didnt realize that we paid for them completely
9281304 now its a crime of necessity for people who are desperate to maintain lifestyles they became accustomed to
9281305 pay stub and job verifications show the income you need on paper

9281308 i didnt know what hit me suddenly blood was pouring from my chest
9281309 our productivity in clearing contaminated areas will be cut by 50 percent at the end of the month when the teams stop their work
9281310 and 2009 is a whole other story without funding we will have to stop all the teams
9281311 of course we are afraid to work and do our jobs but we have to we have to put food on the table
9281312 43 percent of the areas affected by the cluster bombs dropped during the july 2006 war have been cleared and the direct threat has been eliminated from 49 percent of the contaminated areas which means the surface bombs have been removed
9281313 aside from the cluster bombs we still have 300 000 landmines along the blue line the frontier with israel
9281314 many of the bombs were dropped on agricultural lands which means farmers are staying away from their land
9281315 we will continue to feel the effects of cluster bombs for another 100 or 200 years
9281316 this area was supposed to be clean but our neighbour was hurt just the other day when one blew up there are some areas where you cant even work the land
9281317 i saw one with a white string on it in the field and ran away i also saw one on the road when we first came back
9281318 the united nations has repeatedly requested cluster bomb data from israel including maps and the type of ordnance dropped but in two years plus we still havent received the requested data
9281319 this remains the main obstacle to the cluster bomb clearing effort
9281320 i was hurt from head to toe my stomach was literally blown open and i lost sight in my right eye
9281321 we had a call about 12 30pm this afternoon for a light plane that has gone into the water just south of jumpinpin bar

9281324 it is very disappointing that pakistan hasnt played a test match this year i dont think such a thing has happened to any country in the past
9281325 we would have played at least three tests had australia toured pakistan but it is very sad that we are having a year without tests the more test matches in pakistan the better for the country since test cricket is the real test of a players temperament and skill
9281326 well hand the child over to his family very soon
9281327 the speedster has been approached by the surrey management as it wanted to hire shoaibs services during the ongoing season
9281328 shoaib wanted to play a couple of matches for english county surrey and had applied for the noc we have issued him the noc with the condition that he had to show his availability whenever required during that period
9281329 if the series materialises he shoaib has to show his availability for the national team irrespective of his commitments with surrey in case of his selection on the national team he will have to return home to join the squad
9281330 we are happy that he has got a chance to play competitive cricket the short stint with the english county will definitely help him regain his form and fitness it will also give him a chance to prove his fitness for international cricket
9281331 the president should always be non partisan but the presidency will again become abode of a political party if zardari is elected president
9281332 after a detailed review of the determination by nepra the prime minister in consultation with finance minister syed naveed qamar and minister for water and power raja pervaiz ashraf allowed a 31 per cent increase in power tariff
9281333 it is for the first time in the recent history of the country that power tariff is being increased by 31 per cent
9281334 there will be no increase in power tariff for consumers who consume only 50 units but those who consume more than 50 units will now have to pay huge bills
9281335 we will ensure the implementation of the plan of action as proposed by the conference to deal with the serious issue
9281336 however the nation has the resilience and the courage to stand up to such challenges
9281337 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august

9281343 we know from previous scientific research that boys who have active and involved fathers are more likely to do better academically socially and emotionally
9281344 given that many dads of today credit their father as being their most important teacher of life skills underscores just how important male role models can be for young boys
9281345 the language of fathering is all about doing things sometimes its kicking a football around other times it might be helping to tinker around with the car
9281346 the dth licensee bharti telemedia is ordered to seek separate fipb approval within three months from the date of issue of this order
9281347 the requirement of a separate fipb approval is a procedural matter and we will submit all necessary details as required
9281348 we have all required approvals in place and are in complete compliance of all regulatory guidelines including fdi and the foreign equity as applicable
9281349 we are in the final stages of negotiations with them terms have almost been finalised and we are confident of sealing at least one acquisition within the next two to three weeks
9281350 funds from arcapita were received two weeks ago and would be used to fuel our expansion programme including acquisitions
9281351 with arcapitas investment we intend to scale up our growth and reach we also plan to add new lines of products and services which will further improve our revenue yield
9281352 the customised products include services like customer profiling based on various attributes atm locators and delivery point validations among others
9281353 the ratio of preparation of a document to its postage costs is 1 6
9281354 our merger and acquistion team has been mandated to look for iron ore and coal assets both abroad and in india for acquisition
9281355 we will begin dialogue with ongc on the joint venture in about a week we would also rope in a third partner for the joint venture
9281356 last year we trained around 5 000 employees of nationalised banks this year we have bagged orders to train some 8000 employees of two nationalised banks across 14 locations in india
9281357 it is an indication of the increasing emphasis being laid by nationalised banks on training their employees in the lights of stiff competition arising from private banks
9281358 they are sending them to us for training on using computers and it technology in banking it is basically a practitioner programme and gives stress on financial software training
9281359 at present our priority is on extensive surveys in the target areas to detect the first infection of ug99 or its variants if and when it comes before it acquires alarming proportions
9281360 once the results are out medication should follow we are planning to begin drug distribution to resistant patients by november end
9281361 there is growth in the number of registration of patients every year but it can not be seen as the spread of infection its rather a complementing gesture that people come forward for treatment
9281362 tsiek tsiek and again tsiek tsiek mulan weaves facing the door
9281363 mulan is an old chinese legend but the opera interprets the legend in a brand new style which is very successful
9281364 things are going on well we will be carrying out software and system testing by september and the e auctioning of tea will commence from november
9281365 we could have implemented the e auctioning solution much earlier but for durga puja festivities in west bengal
9281366 it appears that this incident took place following an argument at a party at this property
9281367 we are appealing for anyone who was at the address during the course of this party to come forward and make contact with the police
9281368 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9281369 there are a range of techniques that will help us
9281370 we must stress that the foster family still remain unaccounted for
9281371 its anyones guess but it seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and i cant see them behind something like this
9281372 all we know is they must have missed their jump site
9281373 there would be no more powerful way of making them feel part of the olympics would there
9281374 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9281375 they are avoiding the issue they dont want a status of forces agreement they dont want a security agreement
9281376 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over
9281377 we would have a serious problem if we took it to parliament right now
9281378 late in the ballgame the touchdown drive we were struggling
9281379 because weve had to work so many kids on special teams for when we have to travel with a smaller roster
9281380 were going to have to find that other hundred yards somewhere else
9281381 we need to get some depth at tailback because we cant run carl that much
9281382 i never saw the defensive tackles tired because they were always rotating rotating rotating
9281383 were not going to have one guy staying in the whole time we get tired were going to have somebody come in thats just as good as us
9281384 we were not as good this time last year as we are right now
9281385 we havent had these types of numbers in the past im tickled about it to be honest
9281386 we cant take six offensive linemen into the season with a couple of backups and try to get through the seasons were going to play in the future
9281387 they are the biggest line ive ever had in front of me in my football career
9281388 i want guys that are going to be athletic on the 10th play
9281389 its easier to recruit skill kids because there are so many of them out there
9281390 were going to recruit almost 50 offensive and defensive linemen to get the numbers that we want
9281391 its like the house and it all starts with the foundation
9281392 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9281393 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9281394 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9281395 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9281396 you can just sense that if you give him time back there hes going to find guys and hes got a real attitude about him to take advantage of it
9281397 the only way to bounce back from a game like this is to take it as a learning experience
9281398 we will have a lot of work to do in practice
9281399 its something they have across the board at every position and they really were able to use it to their advantage
9281400 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9281401 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9281402 that is why i will argue that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9281403 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9281404 we should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the g7
9281405 it is my belief and i have some evidence that instead of writing people up and being very succinct that people have made deals
9281406 she visited classrooms she made sure teachers followed the lesson plan she made a real difference
9281407 they wanted me to jump on her but it turns out when you leave her alone shes quite effective
9281408 we wanted what they had and that was the fields
9281409 i was very upset because its not right you cannot profit on a public property
9281410 its one thing to exchange field time with a neighboring team without exchanging money
9281411 but when someone is trying to make a business out of it then it becomes fraud
9281412 it is my belief and i have some evidence that instead of writing people up and being very succinct that people have made deals
9281413 she visited classrooms she made sure teachers followed the lesson plan she made a real difference
9281414 they wanted me to jump on her but it turns out when you leave her alone shes quite effective
9281415 americas lead over its economic rivals has been entirely forfeited
9281416 many of our members carry shame for a destructive past
9281417 were able to work with people who once were enemies and people who you would never think you would get along with
9281418 this is a chance to give back to the community to go home and feel that you made it possible for a family to live and grow and be happy
9281419 with three more houses were making this back into a residential area
9281420 for the first time in my life im actually holding a job
9281421 im working hard and doing something i never thought i would do im going to work coming home and living the family life
9281422 its another attempt by the ethics commission to make it undesirable to be a lobbyist and it has no public policy benefit
9281423 i refuse to wear the equivalent of a yellow arm band
9281424 in fact we were hoping it could be viewed as something positive where people could get familiar with who these people are
9281425 theyre on salary so a one contact rule would basically mean that if you have one contact youre basically a lobbyist
9281426 qualcomm stadium had never registered before seaworld had never registered before and the unions never registered before
9281427 in a weird way i like having guys on second and third
9281428 it makes me more focused i just stuck to my game plan and just tried to hold them off
9281429 youre supposed to keep the same mentality like it was a tie game
9281430 geer changed speeds and kept the ball out of the middle
9281431 there wasnt enough in the recipe for us to win
9281432 theres a great confidence with the way he carried himself in the first inning
9281433 i was ahead in the count and i just wanted to get something that i could hit
9281434 i just lost the strike zone and i couldnt find it i couldnt find the rhythm
9281435 i know pitching coach dave righetti knows what hes doing a lot of times it differs from day to day one day 100 pitches may be too much and the next time 132 may be just enough
9281436 its just that he has a tendency to have a violent delivery
9281437 sometimes hell have a very high pitch count inning hes had some 30s and almost 40 pitch innings those are the innings that really take their toll
9281438 the criticism you cant do anything about theyre going to blame somebody i see guys hurt all over baseball its just that there was more scrutiny with me than just about anybody i look around and there are guys hurt everywhere young pitchers new pitchers new managers old managers plus volquez has never gone this far plus out of the minor leagues they never go over 100 sometimes its 80 to 100
9281439 that might be a tough matchup for nate his first game
9281440 were going to be crowded in the outfield but were going to have to find a way to get nate in there
9281441 my wife and i earn around 250k per year are in our mid 30s and have a newborn child
9281442 this just doesnt make sense and will be a big reason why los angeles will experience a bloodbath in housing prices falling for the next several years that is unless the entire city is inhabited by multimillionaires
9281443 in the meantime well keep renting our excellent 2 000 square foot apartment paying nothing taking awesome vacations going to excellent restaurants etc and saving saving and saving a lot well enter the market when home prices fall to planet earth 2 4 years
9281444 so many mysterious women in black moved in and out of the mausoleum in hollywood cemetery yesterday that it took on the appearance of the salesgirls entrance to a large department store
9281445 since services which account for more than 55 per cent of the national income are not taken into account in the wholesale price index it does not not truly reflect rise in prices
9281446 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9281447 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9281448 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9281449 ive been here four years and i sense that sometimes here
9281450 and it has nothing to do with financial stuff im just talking about strictly as a football player as a teammate as an employee of the giants i dont know i just get that sense its just the way people approach me obviously there are some comments
9281451 are you one of the guys or are you just a guy
9281452 its not about wanting to redo your contract its about wanting to end your career somewhere
9281453 i do have three years on my contract but i dont plan on playing just three more years that doesnt mean you want to make 7 million or 8 million or some crazy pay raise you want the security that youre going to be here i dont want to play for no other team
9281454 and it aint about 50 cents or a million dollars its about appreciation its not always about x amount of dollars its about letting you know that im your guy
9281455 i find it extremely troubling that a parent would say the things he wrote in those messages
9281456 it often seems as though young people rule the world especially since the dot com boom hello google and facebook guys but you might be surprised at how many senior citizens media moguls casino kings chinese tycoons are cutting deals starting new businesses and generally kicking boomer and gen y butt
9281457 if 60 is the new 40 then 80 is the new 60 mellowing with age simply doesnt compute for these folks
9281458 we havent started working on it termination charges yet right now we are examining on various methodologies global practices to calculate fresh termination charges once we have zeroed in on methods then we would see what kind of information we need from operators
9281459 one of the major component of tariff is the termination charge which is not under forbearance not decided by market forces the high termination charges might stifle competition and disturb the level playing field
9281460 the argument that if mobile termination charges are reduced the viability and the sustainability of existing tariff plans may not be possible and may retard growth of mobile subscribers should not be the reason for not reviewing it
9281461 the princes will be remembering the princess privately and in their own way
9281462 february 2009 will mark the 50 years of firing of first blast furnace in india at bhilai steel plant by dr rajendra prasad countrys first president it is an important milestone in the history of steel production
9281463 we have to make provision for an additional rs 1 500 crore to meet the requirement
9281464 all general managers of zonal railways have been instructed to initiate cost control measures in their respective zones they have also been asked to take steps to increase earnings
9281465 it would therefore be onerous and would also cause irreparable loss and injury to the petitioner if the respondents are permitted to retrospectively levy tax on sales of imported sugar between 1997 98 and 1999 2000 and recover the same from the petitioner
9281466 exports to algeria reached 50 462 with the last shipment from nhava sheva port the netherlands is the highest export destination with over 67 700 units
9281467 to say the least i cant tell you how disappointed our football team is considering how much work and effort was put into the start of the season
9281468 all during training camp we protected the ball we did a good job on turnovers we have been smart with the ball and to go out there today and put the ball on the ground several different ways that makes it very difficult
9281469 i thought our players came out and were ready to play but working hard just gives you a chance to win it doesnt guarantee anything i told the players this is the lesson to learn from this game
9281470 we felt like we wanted points and we wanted to go in and feel good about it
9281471 we didnt want to take a chance for a sack and we didnt want to take a chance on a turnover and i think any time you are in that situation and you have a chance to get three points you take the three points because if you take a chance and throw a pass and it gets deflected or you turn it over or you take a sack now you are not giving your team a chance to win
9281472 i think some people doubted how good we are i hope everyone realizes how hard it is to win on the road against a bcs program i dont care who it is in our league it is big
9281473 we are not supposed to beat these people we are not supposed to do that but our kids relish these games
9281474 i was like oh i almost didnt know what to do it was so big
9281475 but i found my old topo map last night and it shows a 1 500 foot climb over 5 miles to sylvia
9281476 i remember that trail being a stroll through meadows until the end when you climb to lyons lake i cant believe you gain so much altitude
9281477 because it has a lake and it has a mouse the other trail had quail and rabbits but i like the lake
9281478 after the athens games the ibf headed ably by abhay singh chautala and his excellent executive body put forth long term plans which helped in the young boxers gaining invaluable international exposure and comprehensive training in germany cuba and canada
9281479 the young boys and girls who were sent there got exposed to new training methods and coaching system we also had a top international coach from cuba b i fernandez with the national team
9281480 even more important was the emphasis laid on juniors and youth
9281481 so far only 20 to 25 packets are being taken from a cvm on a monthly basis as a large number of people are not aware of the new system which we have have introduced with several quality upgrades
9281482 it will help in discovering routes travellers departments and modes of travel that contribute to total emission this will allow corporates and individuals to decide the flight that emits less carbon per passengers
9281483 the software presently will be available with the travel agents who by paying some charges can use it for the benefit of their customers
9281484 we have produced two films ghatothkach and mere baap pehle aap and will be producing two more this fiscal
9281485 we will be completing an animation movie by december its release would however depend upon other box office releases as also the vacation time of children
9281486 this fiscal we aim to acquire distribution rights in the range of 50 100 which would include hindi films non films and foreign films
9281487 we are aiming for a top line growth of 30 35 per cent in the next four to five years
9281488 deficient rainfall in the southern producing states of karnataka and andhra pradesh caused a reduction in acreage to 50 28 lakh hectares from 51 52 lakh hectares in kharif 2007 this will result in a slight fall in production to 50 lakh tons from 52 lakh tons last year
9281489 with good rains in large parts of maharashtra madhya pradesh karnataka and andhra pradesh it is expected that the production of oilseeds this year will be more than last year despite the fact that there have been reports of some soybean crop having been affected by caterpillars in some parts
9281490 going to take it on as the first test of his leadership
9281491 in the last few months the isi has been hyperactive in many ways and we are concerned that kind of activity could increase because thats what they know how to do best
9281492 i think the isi even under president musharraf were not controlled to the extent we would have liked if that is not the case and you now have a civilian administration thats still trying to find its feet and an army general who has stepped back and is not anxious to get involved in affairs of state now in those circumstances what position could the isi come to
9281493 intelligence agencies are like alsatians they have to be kept under check musharraf was the president and chief of the army few people have held such authority
9281494 kayani is of course the chief of the army and should be able to control the isi but if president musharraf wearing two hats could not curb all their activities then i dont know if kayani can do very much better i think intelligence agencies tend to become very difficult when they have no real masters
9281495 they dont really add up to what we would call a major effort to roll back the ceasefire of 2003 second i dont think pakistan is today really in a position to think of a major offensive
9281496 the point really is why is this happening what does it mean its a function of the absence of strong central control people are doing many more things than they would do if there had been tighter control
9281497 i was cruising up 50 at 75 in the 2 lane today all of a sudden theres a huge backup for no apparent reason turns out some was driving 49 mph in the 2 lane so busy watching his mpg he didnt look up when i honked a foot from his window amp these unsafe imbeciles that think they are saving the world how many lives will their inattention cost before they wake the amp up
9281498 im trying to do everything i can said castroneves who will start on the front row with dixon after turning in the second fastest qualifying lap saturday of 102
9281499 were having fun with it every chance i get i say something to him
9281500 we can clinch it sunday said dixon who has won four times this year when starting from the pole
9281501 it would mean a lot there is a lot of pressure going on at the moment you want to get it done
9281502 as everyone always says your first win you never forget castroneves said
9281503 every time i come over here i never forget about that it was a very special moment but that was the past and now we need to focus on the business of what we need to do this weekend
9281504 i like to go after it i like to push it as the hunted you have pressure and if you make a mistake its going to play into the hands of the hunter
9281505 in my eyes we have a great situation here momentum is the key ganassi has been having a fantastic year but finally theyre starting to show some signs of weakness we hope they continue showing that
9281506 the car that we used for sonoma was actually the car that we were supposed to use for detroit castroneves said
9281507 we had to convert it for sonoma and then convert it back for here the good news is we know we have a good car
9281508 weve got to concentrate on just getting the job done dixon said
9281509 theres no point in concentrating on helio or any of the others theres a whole field there that weve got to beat
9281510 off the bat there was a lot of screaming that it was a home run
9281511 obviously i must be throwing beach balls out there its embarrassing when we go out and score that kind of runs and we cant get a win
9281512 im not a home run hitter for me its tough enough to get hits from both sides of the plate
9281513 to hit a ball out there and not make an out is nice too
9281514 i think freddie hit it to the wrong part of the park
9281515 it just goes to show you if you play in a different place what effect it has on a game im proud we battled back and tied it up in the eighth but we let it slip away again
9281516 im tired of fighting yes the research says it wont work but the superintendent wants the program so read180 has to stay
9281517 but if it be of god ye will not be able to overthrow it lest perhaps ye be found even to fight against god
9281518 i respect him for it certainly do but i have no desire to be a car owner and deal with all those challenges
9281519 still if there is a guy out there that can wear both hats it would be tony
9281520 everyone looks at what hes doing and wishes him all the best and knows hes got a big challenge ahead of him were all sitting watching and waiting how its going to work out
9281521 so far yes its been a little bit frustrating and disappointing
9281522 we want to win we want to be competitive we came off such a great year last year and our team has been phenomenal this year we just havent had the runs havent had the cars and when we did have the cars we havent been able to put it all together
9281523 honestly you dont have to win a race to win the championship in my opinion
9281524 were one of the most consistent teams out there but we do need to get our performance up a notch to compete with those guys
9281525 they are going to get the wins they are going to get those bonus points so we got some work cut out but im certainly not counting ourselves out
9281526 a victory all that does is calm the media down to me its not about a win its about consistently running up front and leading laps
9281527 this is a perfect example this track when we lead a lap here were usually in the top five
9281528 its a little bit of an adjustment because i was young when i came into this sport and it seems like it wasnt that long ago i was always considered the kid
9281529 its been a transition but a good one i love my place in this sport right now i have more respect today than ive ever had
9281530 i have everything to be thankful for and no regrets
9281531 but i feel i still have some things left to accomplish
9281532 weve had it like last year when we were leading going into the chase so we know how good it can be
9281533 and weve had it worse where we missed the chase
9281534 weve learned rivalries are a very good thing really brings a lot of attention and makes it exciting
9281535 thats what were hired to do put on great races and create excitement last week was the perfect scenario
9281536 we had a great race we had some wild crashes that guys walked away from and we had guys spinning one another out after the race was over i dont think it gets much better than that
9281537 were trying to get people on the ground before landfall because they will have more evacuations as that hurricane nears the gulf coast states
9281538 to see the tide come in and out and see the kids look for little critters on the beach it renews your spirit and its critically important to connect with puget sound
9281539 ive often felt it was a mistake when the state allowed people to buy puget sound shoreline and put up houses
9281540 theoretically 18 percent of the shoreline is open to public access but if youre trying to get on it with your own two feet without a boat that drops to 11 percent
9281541 any kid that could use a mentor could have one
9281542 its always good for kids to have a positive connection with law enforcement
9281543 it sounds like a lot of money but its not
9281544 counties have had to endure a disproportionate burden of the gma for its first 15 years
9281545 theyve all been challenged and it takes time money and political capital to respond
9281546 since 2005 weve been funded basically the same amount of money
9281547 i couldnt give my all because of my left hand
9281548 i was turning into the pits with just one hand on the steering wheel and was unable to do my best
9281549 why else would he have known to put on a windbreaker for a long drenching night
9281550 you can always take layers off you cant always put them on
9281551 we have suspended the agitation for the time being and not called it off as some of our demands are yet to be met
9281552 the proprietary status ownership and title of the land shall not undergo any change
9281553 i assume the presentation you three are working on will deal with those things in addition to volcanoes and wind
9281554 you passed out in the van and i carried you up like a bride
9281555 it will be excruciating youre all about to go to hell
9281556 in the u n system when people see some trouble in africa
9281557 i dont think that we played what i consider well more than three series in a row on either side of the ball
9281558 that was a pretty sloppy game and offensively we were pretty sloppy
9281559 weve got a long ways to go and a lot of room to get better
9281560 he may have made the biggest play of the game
9281561 i felt we were clearly in the ballgame at that point and maybe gaining some confidence in our play
9281562 the game was not over but i dont know if were mature enough just yet to handle something like that at this point
9281563 i dont think that we played what i consider well more than three series in a row on either side of the ball
9281564 that was a pretty sloppy game and offensively we were pretty sloppy
9281565 weve got a long ways to go and a lot of room to get better
9281566 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9281567 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9281568 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9281569 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9281570 thats always a difficult situation in the second half when youre up 50 0 at halftime you want your backups to move it but you dont want to be a bad guy and be throwing it all over the place and taking advantage of whats there
9281571 those are all tough decisions thats just the way it goes
9281572 its the first time out this year trying to kind of avenge a loss at the fiesta bowl last year so there was a lot of preparation put in to come out and play well
9281573 a nice trait of ours is that our players have always played until the end of the game they came back and played hard the whole game from that standpoint i was pleased
9281574 it was a great win for us but at the same time we cant beat our chests because it was just our first game
9281575 weve got a new opponent coming in the second week that weve got to get this game behind us
9281576 everything isnt always perfect or how you want it to be
9281577 what is it exactly that the v p does every day
9281578 its exciting to know i got one under my belt with this whole knee deal
9281579 im back to 100 percent i feel good and were ready to start preparing for ohio state
9281580 thats an exciting aspect of our offense that i felt like we didnt have the last couple of years
9281581 knowing we have these two weeks to prepare means a lot too
9281582 he dealt with it in a mature fashion hes looking toward the future and not dwelling on it it has made him a better person in the end and he is just looking forward to week 2 and getting back to the seahawks
9281583 public support for a childs education follows that child into the school the parent chooses
9281584 hes fast just quick i dont do timed 40 yard dashes but ive coached 4 5 guys and hes that fast
9281585 if the linebacker blows it up theres going to be a hole left
9281586 tyler can jump he can dunk a basketball at 5 9
9281587 i look up to those short guys in the nfl
9281588 the guys who get to a college campus and never leave
9281589 giant masquerade ball at madison square garden where 20 000 radicals and liberals came dressed up as moderates and centrists in the greatest single exhibition of cross dressing in american political history
9281590 the democrats have a habit of inventing things to worry about and finding things to obsess about and being depressed when they ought to be happy
9281591 i mean this is a democratic year relax youre on top for a change
9281592 after all its just a bunch of old rich white guys what could be easier to handle than that
9281593 we like to think of our city as accessible and handicap friendly
9281594 but these guys are unbelievable not only do they want wheelchairs canes and walkers they also want a whole fleet of those motorized rascals and 24 7 access to every pharmaceutical known to man
9281595 these old geezers will be trolling our two cities all hours of the day
9281596 and that means extra police out in force to protect them from criminals each other and even themselves frankly id rather have a national 4 h convention with a bunch of hormone addled adolescents
9281597 bella arriverei a odiare me stesso se dovessi farti del male non hai idea di che tormento sia stato
9281598 il pensiero di te avvampare di rossore di non poter pi cogliere la scintilla nel tuo sguardo quando capisci che ti sto prendendo in giro non sarei in grado di sopportarlo
9281599 se fossi capace di sognare sognerei te e non me ne vergogno
9281600 une pratique consistant jouer le r le de ses personnages h ros de mangas danimation japonaise de tokusatsu de films ou de jeux vid o voire de ses artistes de musique favoris notamment en imitant leur costume et leur maquillage
9281601 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
9281602 as well as one of the most successful debut single to be release in the country 13 the success of utadas singles eventually lead the album
9281603 addicted to you the first single from the album breaking the one million mark in its first week and reaching 1 on the oricon singles chart for two consecutive weeks a personal first and eventually netting sales of 1 784 000 copies remaining utadas most successful single of all time
9281604 experimental tones for the first time in utadas discography something that would display itself fruitfully in all the heart station eras singles
9281605 i dont think its the music that im concerned about its obviously that i look really different and there really arent any completely asian people who are popular singers in the u s right now
9281606 was released at the end of june 2005 and featured remixes from jj flores and peter bailey
9281607 you make me want to be a man bloodshy amp avant mix
9281608 you make me want to be a man junior jack mix
9281609 but new orleanians are very resilient very tough and well get through this
9281610 if we have anything it will be street flooding and hopefully not that bad
9281611 things we were doing during katrina we already did two weeks ago
9281612 as long as its out of harms way its ok
9281613 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9281614 if you dont go out of your house and stay put you should be fine
9281615 i dont think ive even cried from katrina yet i havent had time
9281616 if we leave from here everything you got is stolen when you get back
9281617 there is no question we are taking this storm seriously
9281618 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9281619 the impact is going to be felt over a wide area
9281620 things werent really as bad as they could have been
9281621 not bad you might think for a refugee who started at the bottom of the ladder 34 years ago indeed you could say that ghaffurs career is eloquent testimony to the magnificent opportunities open to members of ethnic minorities in the british police force yet this is the man who now has the gall to present himself as a victim of racism apparently claiming that he has been systematically harassed spied upon and denied further opportunities because of the colour of his skin
9281622 whose mission is to enable every individual and business on the planet to manage their contribution to the defining issue of our age global warming established in 2000 carbon planet has been working with businesses around the world helping them quantify the risks and explore the opportunities emerging in the carbon constrained economy
9281623 he may have made the biggest play of the game
9281624 i felt we were clearly in the ballgame at that point and maybe gaining some confidence in our play
9281625 the game was not over but i dont know if were mature enough just yet to handle something like that at this point
9281626 the players who were here worked hard over the olympic break coop sparks head coach michael cooper put them through really tough practices and they got a lot better
9281627 l a is a really physical team and i think we need to respond to that
9281628 they believe in our defense and thats half the battle
9281629 if they believe in it theyll go out there and commit to it
9281630 if you cant count on somebody for whatever the reason
9281631 i didnt count ashley out until last nights game was over
9281632 it was a fair evaluation of that position but it was also tough because both guys played well
9281633 i was obviously excited for me and the opportunity but im also disappointed for matt and know the position that hes in
9281634 there were a lot of things that we were looking at it was a whole bunch of information
9281635 part of being a good player is reining those emotions in and being able to control them that was one of the things that we got to see last night he was able to do that after last week
9281636 the bottom line is you just want to be on the football field and you want to play
9281637 i still feel like i can do that at a high level
9281638 have another chance to compete and hopefully take us to someplace we havent been in some time and have another run at a championship
9281639 its a w said steve erban a gophers booster as he exited the dome
9281640 no 1 be bold and aggressive on issues and priorities most important to the american people
9281641 no 2 make sure that people understand that barack obamas views are not in the best interest of the country
9281642 a strong record of increasing taxes on energy which is exactly the wrong direction for the country
9281643 john mccain issued one statement that was definitive clear and reflected the reality of the situation
9281644 in contrast barack obama issued three or four statements steadily evolving over several days essentially into sen mccains position
9281645 this was a snapshot of the value of having experienced wisdom and judgment on these matters
9281646 mccain was able to articulate what he believes in a crisp decisive manner
9281647 in contrast it was one of those instances where you dont see barack obama with a teleprompter hes kind of stammering wandering halting hes asked basic questions like why do you want to be president when does life begin and he gives fairly unconvincing fairly unclear answers
9281648 mccain has an extraordinary compelling story of accomplishment and service and putting country first even if it meant great peril for him physically politically or otherwise
9281649 obamas resume is quite thin at least for the purpose of someone who wants to be president of the united states
9281650 barack obama has not led the country on an issue of national significance in a way that has cost him anything politically he always toes the partisan line
9281651 everybodys for that that wasnt some act of courage to take on his party
9281652 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9281653 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9281654 its hard to believe its happening again this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9281655 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region
9281656 ti amo pi di qualsiasi altra cosa al mondo senza eccezioni non ti basta
9281657 de tradition gaulliste voire de son propre aveu bonapartiste il se place donc dans une droite conservatrice profond ment antilib rale tant au point de vue conomique que soci tal

9281660 the interest in gathering and disseminating the information or news conveyed and maintaining the free flow of information
9281661 they said we took their jobs but i was working from 6 a m to 8 p m
9281662 they need to go and do this in every little town
9281663 and it seems like they have just arrived and are getting the nice cars and the good homes
9281664 placed all the burdens of a broken system onto immigrant families
9281665 americas lead over its economic rivals has been entirely forfeited
9281666 and i dont think too many people could argue with that label
9281667 discrimination in voting today is more subtle than the visible methods used in 1965 however the effects and results are the same
9281668 an opportunity to take a more serious look at how it can fix its voting laws to better protect minority voting rights
9281669 do you think its possible your child could grow up to be president or not
9281670 were going to go back to mississippi and get called racial epithets again this isnt going to change anything
9281671 when we played chicago you saw guys you never heard of getting open and making good plays our second group was going against their best defense and doing what they wanted to to them
9281672 it would take us a whole half to cross the 50 yard line
9281673 you saw in the past with your own eyes what his offense could do
9281674 weve got a new leader on the ship when he stands up in the room you know he knows what hes talking about everythings going to change this year
9281675 no matter what you have done in this league he makes you feel like you still have to prove yourself
9281676 if i mess up hes going to get on me thats what i like about him he treats everybody the same
9281677 hes what we thought hed be and more he doesnt make mental errors hes the kind of player to build an offense around
9281678 they can both catch the ball and theyre outstanding runners but theyre just different frank is a more physical and powerful back inside and marshall is very elusive
9281679 after practice id look at my phone and wouldnt see a phone call from her ill never get over it but im getting better
9281680 we felt like we had a chance to win this football game in this difficult environment
9281681 the disappointing things were one we couldnt run the football as we thought wed be able to run the football and two defensively we gave up a few too many big plays
9281682 i thought in some areas they did pretty good the tight end middleton got his first start today and i thought he did pretty good overall but weve still got to grow
9281683 theres no area we can say we feel comfortable about
9281684 not only do we have a good group of defensive backs but we also have some young guys that we need to keep around because we have a couple older guys whether their contracts are up or things like that who might be graduating one day
9281685 we have some decent defensive backs and i didnt want to put them out on the street so somebody else could benefit
9281686 when it gets right down to it it really became a durability issue
9281687 he did not practice much since hes been here there have been some durability issues if you cant count on somebody for whatever the reason its a tough call we made the decision we did
9281688 i thought the competition was good and it made us better
9281689 i thought zak keasey got better and was a contributor on special teams
9281690 when it gets right down to it it really became just a durability issue
9281691 i believe that moran will do well wherever he goes
9281692 i think somebody who is looking for a fullback will find a very good player in moran that was a difficult cut today
9281693 he is a jack of all trades at this point probably a master of none
9281694 when you take the total package of michael robinson he is pretty valuable to your football team
9281695 he wasnt pushing for the job as we may have hoped
9281696 we have some decent defensive backs and i didnt want to put them out there in the street to someone elses benefit
9281697 extensive building plans for high point already matured will have best year in history of the city
9281698 raising funds for house corporation by a city canvass active work of promoting corporation to build homes is undertaken
9281699 to make a house by house canvass in the city for the purpose of urging local citizens to become stockholders in the corporation
9281700 the intention of the committee is not only to make a house to house canvass but to make a man to man canvass in other words every person living in high point will be given the opportunity to become a part of the organization by purchasing stock
9281701 by paying 10 percent down and 1 percent monthly and a specific time would be given in which to pay for the home
9281702 the corporation has not decided in what section of the city the new homes will be erected it is possible that they will be built in every part of town in which property for that purpose can be purchased
9281703 none of the homes were built in the black community
9281704 id like to think its because of some of the areas of my expertise
9281705 the position has been expanded to include the supervision of administration institutional advancement finance and business and technology
9281706 what weve been able to do here was out of a team effort
9281707 i believe there are programs and activities that have been put into place that will remain
9281708 they may take on a different shape but the essence will remain the same
9281709 i dont want to drive away and never come back
9281710 its important to preserve the legacy of both institutions and support the activities of both
9281711 i hope to be able to share information both ways
9281712 admission is free but we will be accepting donations and they will all go to camp carefree
9281713 we have done bake sales and car washes and several other fundraisers to secure the cost of the carolina theater we have wonderful staff here at moses cone health systems
9281714 they are pretty phenomenal and were excited to have them present at our talent show
9281715 lets fill up the carolina theatre and help some great kids go to camp
9281716 in normal circumstances the additional player added to the australia squad would come from those selected for australia a hilditch said
9281717 with only two one day internationals remaining in darwin and 12 fit players however its unlikely that any replacement player would play in either of these matches
9281718 given the importance of the australia a tour of india where players will have an opportunity to press for test selection in the upcoming australia india series it was decided that a young emerging player should be added to the national team to gain experience
9281719 about 10 hours he said today when asked how close he was to giving up on his first class career
9281720 i was really really close i was offered a job and i was going to take it and start on the monday
9281721 but i spoke to my father and he said no dont that would be pretty stupid
9281722 luckily i didnt and its all worked out quite well
9281723 they flogged the pants off me and hit the gym hard
9281724 i never thought id play for australia for it to happen is quite unbelieveable he said

9281735 gquan wrote there is a greater darkness than the one we fight it is the darkness of the soul that has lost its way the war we fight is not against powers and principalities it is against chaos and despair greater than the death of flesh is the death of hope the death of dreams against this peril we can never surrender the future is all around us waiting in moments of transition to be born in moments of revelation no one knows the shape of that future or where it will take us we know only that it is always born in pain

9281739 i liked her daring her arrogance and i mean that in a good way

9281741 but ive been here on the inside and its really a good deal
9281742 never tested positive for a steroid or any other performance enhancing drug
9281743 near the end of last season the league claimed he had a diuretic in his system that they said could also be used as a masking agent
9281744 after jesse spent great time and money defending his innocence the league made its final ruling
9281745 if you cant count on somebody for whatever the reason
9281746 i didnt count ashley out until last nights game was over
9281747 when we played chicago you saw guys you never heard of getting open and making good plays our second group was going against their best defense and doing what they wanted to to them
9281748 it would take us a whole half to cross the 50 yard line

9281757 the conventions for the most part serve as a mechanism to rally the troops and provide a snapshot for the larger population of what the party and what the nominee hope to emphasize during the campaign
9281758 over the past two years of democrats running congress we have seen nothing in the way of new solutions theyre promising to all the problems that are facing our nation
9281759 on very important things mccain has differed with the president
9281760 they need to highlight things to show that hes the true maverick
9281761 one is sean hannity and ever since i was a little boy ive had a crush on katie couric so id like to see her
9281762 it wasnt until a week later that it hit me im here by myself
9281763 during my four years at douglass i became more aware of myself and my own values
9281764 i think that is as important for undergraduates as learning about a particular subject matter
9281765 i wouldnt say i was totally disengaged but more of what was going on with me was trying to figure out how my academic work might be relevant to the issues of the day
9281766 my teaching was really informed by my time in washington
9281767 i think shes a great listener and can project what people are doing without being sell sell sell
9281768 it was also interesting to watch her be tough because she was still warm and friendly
9281769 i think linda is a very strong leader and i think she is going to figure out how to get uncg to the next level
9281770 i had and still have a dream that the web could be an interactive sea of shared knowledge i imagine it immersing us as a warm friendly environment made of the things we and our friends have seen heard believe or have figured out
9281771 its up to the celebrants to decide how to celebrate
9281772 collaboration connection creativity freedom by the end of the day the web should be just a little bit better than it was before and well be able to see our connection more clearly
9281773 i felt like i was able to play a big role on special teams and offense
9281774 they were better than us in a lot of phases of the game but fortunately the only phase they didnt play as well in was with brandon tate
9281775 i still dont think the whole things sunk in yet
9281776 i just know we needed some big plays tonight and every time i got the ball i was able to make one
9281777 last year i didnt think about other peoples lives or their salvation
9281778 we make them sacrifice their time to pay for it
9281779 even though a lot of the adults had no shoes or shirts and lived on dirt floors when asked what they needed they answered that theyd just like for their kids to have more
9281780 it was like giving out new cars when we gave out new soccer balls
9281781 we all learned to be more thankful for what we have and realized god is going to supply our every need and we dont really need a lot to be happy
9281782 god has given me so much most importantly my salvation through jesus christ and it is my privilege to share it with others
9281783 i was able to lead two jamaican children to the lord as well as a lady in the airport in jamaica and another lady in the airport in atlanta
9281784 my goal is to take teens on trips to realize you can have fun and serve the lord too
9281785 i want them to say missions is a lot of work but fun too and i hope some of them will be encouraged to become missionaries some day
9281786 when i first signed up i thought it would be fun
9281787 it turned into me wanting to impact peoples lives like that every day in full time missions work
9281788 the kids were so yearning for love and theyd cry when you put them down
9281789 i realized it was so much fun talking about the love of jesus
9281790 i realized i could do it for the rest of my life
9281791 to me its all about the powerful and the privileged taking advantage of a working class african american community
9281792 greensboro college would never purchase property in irving park or starmount or college hill
9281793 youre putting a predominantly white school in the middle of a black neighborhood and expecting people not to be upset
9281794 there are so many positives that could come out of a situation like this
9281795 to get us out of here to do what they want to do
9281796 we have great respect for what warnersville means in the historical sense and what it means to the people living there today
9281797 and we want to pay tribute to j c price in a way that benefits individuals today
9281798 its not for someone else to come in and tell us what we can do with our neighborhood
9281799 every year every month that we are together it will improve
9281800 i couldnt even lock the dead bolt or open the windows
9281801 do you really think i could have ever missed a crack like that
9281802 not related to the construction of the embankment or pile driving operation
9281803 it is our position there is no negligence on the part of any state employee and no legal liability
9281804 its been very frustrating i was too trusting in the beginning
9281805 i just want them to pay me back some of my retirement money
9281806 when my children were young i tried to think of a unique and inexpensive gift to give
9281807 then it snowballed into making gift tags and bag tags and invitations
9281808 i tell my customers that every stamp may not be in the same place and it may not be exactly like the sample on the web site
9281809 i actually didnt have a web site until last fall
9281810 but thats perfect because my kids are out of school
9281811 before the business i was a 100 percent full time mom
9281812 ive always been drawn to nature botanicals that kind of design
9281813 modern rustic seemed to fit with this 200 year old building
9281814 there are so many ways to give back to the environment
9281815 im a design studio but im also trying to lead people along the path of doing things in their home that are environmentally friendly
9281816 this corner with fresh market across the street its a high traffic area
9281817 you are the salt of the earth the light of the world
9281818 i run so much if i dont try to manage the rest of my life while running
9281819 every day became an act of quiet desperation waking up and hoping i could get through the day
9281820 i found very family oriented well adjusted essentially happy people who lack some things we take for granted

9281825 i am the single minded driving force out there and i think thats necessary for somebody to be in that role
9281826 people will come away inspired by the fact that we are all very willing to show our weaknesses
9281827 i decided i had to make a change or i wasnt going to survive
9281828 what i have now is an addiction to living and making sure that i use my time as wisely and passionately as i possibly can
9281829 anything worth doing is worth doing to the absolute maximum

9281842 to tell you the truth its very unlikely i can set this record
9281843 this is my attempt to do something deemed to be impossible i am very excited about putting myself in that position but have no idea what the outcome will be
9281844 and frankly thats kind of the point i wouldnt do it if i knew i could
9281845 i just swallowed a bug its the way i get protein these days

9281889 a prosperous united world representing a true new world order could only be attained step by step while we are still far from world government we must first focus on essential issues that work in that direction

9281891 a decade later asia new responsibilities in the international monetary system
9281892 international monetary reform usually becomes possible only in response to a felt need and the threat of a global crisis the global crisis would have to involve the dollar

9281919 we don t have anyone on the practice squad in the secondary now
9281920 it might be one heavy compared to what we normally do and i think a lot of that has to do from the standpoint that we not only have a decent group of defensive backs but we do have several young guys that we need to keep around because we have a couple older guys whether their contracts are up or things like that who might be graduating one day
9281921 i think zak keasey was a better player as well plus zak gives us some presence on the special teams very good presence as a matter of fact in the kicking game
9281922 uses the the same abrasive that is used in microdermabrasion called corundum crystal which is extremely fine
9281923 i told congress thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere
9281924 i think thats when the campaign for national office began
9281925 someone whos stopped government from wasting taxpayers money on things they dont want or need
9281926 someone with an outstanding reputation for standing up to special interests and entrenched bureaucracies
9281927 someone who has fought against corruption and the failed policies of the past
9281928 someone who has reached across the aisle and asked republicans democrats and independents to serve in government
9281929 it would be hard not to appear conservative with the huge budget approved by the majority
9281930 i thought she showed some guts in doing that and really irritated some folks
9281931 ok youve got valley trash standing here in the middle of nowhere
9281932 i think were going to make a good team as we progress that bridge project
9281933 in the role of governor she should be pursuing a transportation policy that benefits the state of alaska rather than pandering to the southern 48

9281943 thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven
9281944 and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors
9281945 and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil

9281949 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand in front of soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed
9281950 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9281951 since they say the waters will be here until the end of october im making a boat
9281952 we will be able to use it to get to the market and come back with supplies
9281953 from tonight we will begin supplying them with cooked food
9281954 we have had nothing to eat except some rice cakes and palm sugar
9281955 no lo conozco pero escuch que rudy ulloa el choferata de kirchner anda con 100 palos verdes y lo quiere comprar
9281956 nobody can say that the party isnt unified after the jobs that hillary clinton bill clinton and barack obama did in their speeches
9281957 obama showed that he will hit back democrats worried about having another john kerry on their hand were appeased
9281958 disaffected democratic women are not going to vote for an evangelical pro life creationist
9281959 there is plenty of anecdotal and survey evidence that not all clinton supporters have embraced
9281960 but in all likelihood most liberal leaning clinton supporters will slide over to the obama column
9281961 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9281962 you know it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9281963 vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations
9281964 enthusiasm is why bush won the 2004 election over john kerry it allowed him to maximize republican turnout in ohio and other key states
9281965 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
9281966 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
9281967 by and large they are chomping at the bit they are ready to go
9281968 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
9281969 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
9281970 the only reason youre conscious right now is because i dont want to carry you
9281971 ryan is constantly asking how do my brows look hes more concerned with them than his hair
9281972 he even has a kit with tweezers and brow gel in case of an emergency
9281973 there is a deep and unresolved political problem in this country which i personally think can only be resolved through dialogue and negotiation
9281974 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9281975 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9281976 i feel that weve gone back to the starting point again
9281977 i have no resentment against arabs who come to kurdistan as workers or tourists
9281978 we want kurdistan to be the tourist destination for arabs who will pump money into our economy
9281979 all my bad impressions about the kurds have been wiped out
9281980 kurdistan is part of iraq and we encourage iraqis living in the south and center to visit the kurdish region
9281981 we have very tight security we dont want sulaimaniyah to be like fallujah
9281982 mante poi lo ha riportato sul suo blog e per curiosit gli ho dato una guardata ed
9281983 and he can get things done where i dont believe obama could
9281984 not until the job is finished until the governing body in iraq says they dont want us there anymore
9281985 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
9281986 barack obama doesnt have anything in his background to suggest he understands economics either
9281987 does kay hagan think we believe that elizabeth doles got firepower she just received the best of congress award she saved our military bases and thousands of jobs saved our farmers and gave sheriffs tools to fight illegal immigration
9281988 i have a laptop i take back and forth to work
9281989 did she make a mistake in helping her husband cover up the affair of course she did but she is far more the wronged party what she did was cover up for her husband i can understand that
9281990 for an imperfect man who had come to face his own imperfections
9281991 charlies one of the smartest political minds in the business
9281992 i think he shows us the worst side of how washington works
9281993 hes very much a player in what is ultimately a very small town
9281994 youd have to say this was one of the greatest political comebacks of any weve seen in modern history
9281995 ive proven to be pretty good at pulling strategies together and getting people to cooperate
9281996 the philosophy was what moved me limited government strong national defense stand up to communism
9281997 nikki thinks the running of the bulls should be changed and we should be chased by the spainish sic mens hockey team
9281998 i would definately sic make sure i got caught and impaled
9281999 nikki has a black eye from all the girls pushing me out of the way to get prime position by the window seeing naked aussies in rooms across from us
9282000 im quite light hearted and dont take myself seriously she said
9282001 i definitely wouldnt have written those quotes if i knew everybody could read it
9282002 impaled amp squo amp squo by members of the spanish men amp squo s hockey team
9282003 hudson said she had apologised to the head of hockey australia and hoped no one was offended by the posting

9282009 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9282010 these subjects are part of a longer and mid term discussion
9282011 the whole pattern of atmospheric and wind conditions is very favorable
9282012 if we have any kind of serious damage that disrupts production we will likely see a price spike
9282013 even a small storm would put those islands completely underwater
9282014 if he unleashed violence to live at the inception of his struggle today he is living to unleash violence
9282015 shes not from these parts but youre going to be as impressed as i am
9282016 she knows who she works for she stands up for what is right and she doesnt let anybody tell her to sit down
9282017 the right reason is to challenge the status quo and to serve the common good
9282018 it is sooo good to be here in steelers country
9282019 shes going to excite things and tell it like it is
9282020 i think hes made a wise choice im not a barack obama fan and this helps me to decide
9282021 just leave it to my friend john to say its about time the republican party put a woman on the ticket
9282022 and not just any woman shes not a soccer mom shes a hockey mom
9282023 i liked that but i still need to know more about her
9282024 my initial reaction was its nice to see a woman
9282025 but when i heard her speak and use hillary clintons very words about the glass ceiling i was insulted she doesnt get it women and men did not vote for hillary based solely on gender
9282026 this was the gathering place for all the kids in green ridge
9282027 joe wouldnt back down from a fight he was fearless
9282028 there were no drugs or anything like that we played baseball went to the movies
9282029 the first principle of politics the foundational principle i learned in the 1950s in my grandpops kitchen when i was about 12 or 13 years old
9282030 once we spent our limit on penny candy from simmeys charlie roth larry orr tommy bell and i would head down to the roosie roosevelt theater for the 12 cent double feature usually a pair of westerns or tarzan
9282031 this was our first grade classroom we sat right here biden and bell
9282032 joe biden lived here for 10 years and in this house
9282033 everybody that leaves here they stick to their roots they have wonderful values religion is a big part of it and the kids all learned how to get along with each other because there were so many of them
9282034 no 1 be bold and aggressive on issues and priorities most important to the american people
9282035 no 2 make sure that people understand that barack obamas views are not in the best interest of the country
9282036 a strong record of increasing taxes on energy which is exactly the wrong direction for the country
9282037 john mccain issued one statement that was definitive clear and reflected the reality of the situation
9282038 in contrast barack obama issued three or four statements steadily evolving over several days essentially into sen mccains position
9282039 this was a snapshot of the value of having experienced wisdom and judgment on these matters
9282040 mccain was able to articulate what he believes in a crisp decisive manner
9282041 in contrast it was one of those instances where you dont see barack obama with a teleprompter hes kind of stammering wandering halting hes asked basic questions like why do you want to be president when does life begin and he gives fairly unconvincing fairly unclear answers
9282042 mccain has an extraordinary compelling story of accomplishment and service and putting country first even if it meant great peril for him physically politically or otherwise
9282043 obamas resume is quite thin at least for the purpose of someone who wants to be president of the united states
9282044 barack obama has not led the country on an issue of national significance in a way that has cost him anything politically he always toes the partisan line
9282045 everybodys for that that wasnt some act of courage to take on his party
9282046 all we know is they must have missed their jump site
9282047 we dont know anything until the x rays come back
9282048 yalls heart yalls spirit yall mean a whole lot to me
9282049 zoning officials properly concern themselves with the uses of land with for example the number and kind of dwellings to be constructed in a certain neighborhood or the number of persons who can reside in those dwellings but zoning authorities cannot validly consider who those persons are what they believe or how they choose to live whether they are negro or white catholic or jew republican or democrat married or unmarried
9282050 everything happens a first time you cannot predict it until you see it
9282051 it was like the u s was slamming the brakes all the time
9282052 the u s was always trying to calm him down
9282053 youd think youd bring all hands on deck for this one
9282054 what we saw was a foreign led destabilization and what washington clearly saw was us overreacting to internal opposition i think the truth was somewhere in the middle
9282055 for eight long years weve had a president who rushed to stand in front of soldiers at political rallies but abandoned them at walter reed
9282056 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9282057 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9282058 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
9282059 however it was only after the introduction of former everton midfielder manuel fernandes shortly after the 20 minute mark that the hosts really began to turn the screw unai emery withdrew ruben baraja from the action and while it wasnt clear whether baraja was carrying an injury the change proved to be the defining moment of the match as fernandes greater energy and purpose immediately caught the eye and turned the balance of play directly in favour of los che
9282060 the first time in the fourth round the first time i am in the second week its pretty exciting
9282061 i am a tall guy as well so its up near my shoulders where other guys its toward their heads
9282062 as long as i got my racket on it i was doing a pretty good job of keeping it in play against a guy like him there is a sense of urgency especially when he is serving
9282063 when they lose a ballgame they lose it because they get careless or get cocky
9282064 oh thats easy white sox im not one of those fair weather fans
9282065 the cubs theyre nice you go to wrigley field you have a beer the beautiful people out there people arent watching the game its not serious white sox thats baseball
9282066 they were there arguing and this guy was actually trying to get to third with less than two outs we need that hunter said
9282067 youve got to keep playing the game no matter what
9282068 it was a little slider said wood who came in hitting only 113 i got it down thats all i wanted to do
9282069 were going to take this thing one goal at a time and our first goal is getting to the playoffs
9282070 bowyer and those guys sure they are going to be fast the rest of the way but he cant afford too many mistakes basically its going to come down to who can reel off two top 5s or two top 10s
9282071 something freakish like getting stuck in the pits on a green flag or something like that you know one of those tough luck deals
9282072 i knew it would now be a tougher road ahead of us we need top fives and 10s to get us in the chase not 30ths and dnfs did not finish
9282073 i just wanted to get out of there without losing a ton of points and i think we did that but wed be sitting in 12th right now
9282074 this is an important weekend for us we need to get on our game
9282075 we have got to get out of here with a good finish it is time to pull out anything and everything that you can come up with it sure would be nice to get a little bit of an advantage and come out of here with a little bit of a leeway
9282076 if you put too much effort and really try to think about this race too much you will probably make a mistake if you are driving on pins and needles the entire 500 miles
9282077 so i think the biggest thing is just to go out and do what we have been doing if we dont make the chase its certainly not going to be because of these last two races
9282078 my mum and dad joke about who i take after ive seen them both dance and i have to say there must have been a mix up at the hospital
9282079 at his audition stephen daldry director of billy elliot the musical and the film thought tom had great potential and was a very natural actor
9282080 the perfect scenario would be to go to both of the best races which are the gold cup sept 27 at belmont park and breeders cup and then go overseas
9282081 but that will be hard to press into a four week schedule
9282082 bring him on we would love to run against him it would be great for racing great for the fans great for the industry we are just hoping to meet him somewhere
9282083 there was a little concern going into the first turn with the traffic
9282084 he got bumped around a little bit but you could tell halfway down the back side jockey robby albarado was very comfortable with where he was at he went to him when he needed to and it looked like he came back with something left
9282085 we were between two horses and getting bounced around a little but he is a big horse and he handled it
9282086 racing needs a star like curlin and today he showed what he could do
9282087 the mystique of saratoga winning a grade i here the graveyard of champions all of that works into your head leading up to this but he came through like curlin does and were extremely proud of him
9282088 hes a horse of a lifetime dont want to miss it im very fortunate it has lasted this long
9282089 he stumbled and then was clobbered when he got back up so we lost all chance
9282090 i was shocked he ran as good as he did to be honest with you hes been stopping in all his races we did a little work with him but i didnt think it would help him this much
9282091 i never saw the defensive tackles tired because they were always rotating rotating rotating
9282092 were not going to have one guy staying in the whole time we get tired were going to have somebody come in thats just as good as us
9282093 we were not as good this time last year as we are right now
9282094 we havent had these types of numbers in the past im tickled about it to be honest
9282095 we cant take six offensive linemen into the season with a couple of backups and try to get through the seasons were going to play in the future
9282096 they are the biggest line ive ever had in front of me in my football career
9282097 i want guys that are going to be athletic on the 10th play
9282098 its easier to recruit skill kids because there are so many of them out there
9282099 were going to recruit almost 50 offensive and defensive linemen to get the numbers that we want
9282100 its like the house and it all starts with the foundation
9282101 bellevues teachers have had a hard time getting the district to see the importance of their concerns about salary and the curriculum issues hopefully having another party in there will help speed a resolution to this bargaining crisis
9282102 our hope is that were going to start school on time tuesday
9282103 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9282104 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9282105 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9282106 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9282107 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9282108 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9282109 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9282110 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9282111 jockey alan garcia never even used the whip he just flagged her a little as part of our program we school our horses behind other horses so i have no doubt that if alan has to come from off the pace he can
9282112 commercial waterproof fabrics such as gore tex by more than a factor of 100
9282113 its a w said steve erban a gophers booster as he exited the dome
9282114 it felt like you just couldnt quite climb on the carousel like you didnt belong and the only place you did belong was back in iraq
9282115 which is basically insane because we spent the whole time over there thinking about going home
9282116 there is only so much of you that can go around and you stretch as far as you can on all three fronts and i think that is the challenge of being a citizen soldier
9282117 that was our biggest fear you didnt let anyone close to your vehicle because they could drive up on you and you were toast
9282118 what you had to do to keep them away from you thats what you did
9282119 i was going to run him off the road and yank him out of the car because in my mind he was a threat to me and my family and could easily have a bomb
9282120 tim is a very wonderful loving person and a part of that was gone he had to remind himself to open a door or to kiss me good night just those things that were core to his personality
9282121 i knew that the first year that he was home was going to be harder than when he was gone and it was but more so than i ever expected
9282122 im not going to be the person who makes him walk away from something that he is passionate about
9282123 i agree with him on this change is needed but not just in washington d c
9282124 dino has his own coalitions he has to keep together
9282125 they arent dealing with those issues that distract us at the national level
9282126 the ticket part starts with where i am and goes down to where all the legislative candidates are
9282127 we do our own thing and it is very separate and very distinct and the issues are very different i dont have anything to do with world peace
9282128 a presidential campaign is strong enough to drive its own message
9282129 were doing our very best to encourage them to recognize that senator mccain is a heck of a lot better than senator obama in the white house and there is a big chunk of those who agree with us
9282130 right now i think the mccain campaign and the rnc think washington state is a place theyd like to turn into a battleground state
9282131 everyone will know that hes decided to fight for washington state and he doesnt need dino to help him
9282132 looked at the numbers and gave up on washington state
9282133 if that provision is repealed metro would like to sell a limited number of partial wrap buses
9282134 the only reason we brought this back was because of our financial crisis
9282135 they generate a lot of revenue and we think our compromise proposal meets the most significant elements of public complaints
9282136 late in the ballgame the touchdown drive we were struggling
9282137 because weve had to work so many kids on special teams for when we have to travel with a smaller roster
9282138 were going to have to find that other hundred yards somewhere else
9282139 we need to get some depth at tailback because we cant run carl that much
9282140 may have been trying to shock jaded residents into taking prudent step
9282141 warnings were considerably more dramatic than the forecasts issued by the national hurricane center
9282142 theres nothing wrong with acknowledging the panoply of lifes rich experience
9282143 you cant control your mind why would you want to you cant feel guilty about being alive about being a man about feeling attracted you can only control your actions

9282153 a democracy is nothing more than mob rule where fifty one percent of the people may take away the rights of the other forty nine

9282170 thats all been taken into account and weve consulted broadly with industry groups and theres broad support for the plan so we think weve got those things covered

9282186 i would think the best case scenario for melvin would be to be ready to play when we get off this road trip
9282187 thats kind of how i see it if he can play before that i think its a bonus from how he feels today its improved but i think it would probably be doubtful for him to play in boston he might be limited he might be able to pinch hit with a day off thursday i think its more realistic for him to be able to play after that
9282188 ive just had a little cramp or something but ive never had a pull
9282189 you have to heal and let it heal i dont want to blow it up but it depends on how i feel this week
9282190 cabrera was fined an undisclosed amount of money and was disciplined accordingly by me
9282191 thats where were at i am satisfied that he recognized that what he did was inappropriate and i accept his apology
9282192 i talked about whats going on in september and some other things that i had to clear up but i really dont look to put a whole lot of emphasis on it
9282193 every time i have a meeting its blown out of proportion there were just some things that i had to discuss with the team i dont think its anything that deserves headline attention
9282194 i just dont see any need for him the next time before he pitches to do any kind of sideline work
9282195 i think he can just do flat ground work and play catch and get ready to pitch next wednesday then after that with the day off thursday well probably get him on a six day slot for a while i think what he needs to do is back off his throwing in between starts
9282196 the difficulties caused to australians are not ones of threat but are simply ones of inconvenience that may well cause frustration and disappointment
9282197 but theres been no indication that any of the activity which has occurred is in any way aimed at any foreign nationals including australians
9282198 the object of the game is to get them to hit the baseball thats what we need to do not pitch around them hitting the baseball if weve got to throw the ball down the middle and we get our butt beat then we get our butt beat but you have to throw the ball over the plate we cant continue to do this
9282199 i think were making it a whole lot more difficult than we should
9282200 i understand why hes frustrated but in a situation like that game tying home run it was just a big hit
9282201 i think it is probably a good idea i imagine every team has been robbed at some point
9282202 there is a play we are all familiar with that comes to mind
9282203 i guess id have to side with the majority and say it is a good thing
9282204 from a fans perspective and a baseball purists id say it signifies where we are as a society and in baseball in general but from a strategic standpoint it makes sense
9282205 in all likelihood the ball probably would have gone out or been a double or maybe it would have been caught its easy to play devils advocate
9282206 i dont think you can assume a catch and so it probably would have been called a double just like when a ball is hit down the line and a fan picks it up
9282207 in the end of the day everyone would like to see them get the calls right
9282208 you try not to lend too much importance to one game
9282209 but it has amazed me how many people connect with that game particularly yankee fans but really people everywhere
9282210 the goal is to have employers look at disabled workers the way coaches looked at me
9282211 we need a left handed pitcher we dont care what he looks like as long as he can do the job and we are trying to get people to look past those things and give disabled people a chance
9282212 we came in with the game plan that we were going to load up and run the ball so i was pretty prepared for it
9282213 i just wanted to let people know what i can do and help my teammates out
9282214 we wanted to get darel scott some confidence and once he got it he was gone
9282215 normally he would break some of those runs i dont think he quite had his third gear today
9282216 this is not like a moral victory i dont believe in moral victories
9282217 we had opportunities and we let them get away were greatly disappointed
9282218 you know it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9282219 vision for reforming our government building prosperity and ensuring peace for future generations
9282220 enthusiasm is why bush won the 2004 election over john kerry it allowed him to maximize republican turnout in ohio and other key states
9282221 everyone kind of put an x on our backs and we just had to defend it
9282222 we came out here and defended it hopefully it will be a good statement game i guess you could say
9282223 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9282224 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9282225 decker is such a great athlete that we have him a part of it and he showed what he could do in this game
9282226 after the season we had last year we just werent going to give up
9282227 we never got down on ourselves as a team we knew that if we got the ball with some time left we could make something happen luckily we put the ball in at the end
9282228 we had no choice but to win this game we went into spring ball preparing for this game we knew after this game we had to be 1 0
9282229 sometimes you take wins for granted we learned last year you cant do anything like that we stuck with the game plan and never gave up on each other we have really grown and know its about continuing that into our next game
9282230 mike had the complete respect of the players sold them that defense would win it and the chemistry on this team was great
9282231 is very athletic has some power and is a much more polished player than i thought he was
9282232 i never want to see james lose it feels like he has 20 000 friends here screaming right in my ear
9282233 i got a little tight out there to be honest
9282234 talent gets you to a certain level and then the hard work starts to kick in and if youre not putting in the hard work youre not going to get the opportunities to win a grand slam
9282235 i didnt think i was out of it but i knew it was going to be tough to come back because he was playing really really well
9282236 he was serving close to the lines and hitting the ball so hard and flat and very deep
9282237 i can assure you that the toll increase whatever he comes out with will not be even close to what he proposed before
9282238 if we as a society and as a state agree that we need to fund transportation and we agree that the only real way to do that is by raising the money then we have to decide whats the fairest way
9282239 were going to confront it and make it a priority
9282240 i just hope its not an election year or leading up to an election year gimmick but its true reform
9282241 shes not from these parts but youre going to be as impressed as i am
9282242 she knows who she works for she stands up for what is right and she doesnt let anybody tell her to sit down
9282243 the right reason is to challenge the status quo and to serve the common good
9282244 it is sooo good to be here in steelers country
9282245 shes going to excite things and tell it like it is
9282246 i think hes made a wise choice im not a barack obama fan and this helps me to decide
9282247 just leave it to my friend john to say its about time the republican party put a woman on the ticket
9282248 and not just any woman shes not a soccer mom shes a hockey mom
9282249 i liked that but i still need to know more about her
9282250 my initial reaction was its nice to see a woman
9282251 but when i heard her speak and use hillary clintons very words about the glass ceiling i was insulted she doesnt get it women and men did not vote for hillary based solely on gender
9282252 we didnt think he had a chance to stay healthy
9282253 itd be nice to have him now but who could have forecast all hed go through to come back the way he did
9282254 i know him as a man that answers straight questions with straight answers
9282255 and hes been a sox fan since before he was a senator like most fans whenever i see him he wants to know if we have enough pitching
9282256 a couple months ago when he asked that question i told him pitching is like votes you can never be comfortable you have enough
9282257 my character is this lover and confidante of the duchess
9282258 but she also ends up being the lover and confidante of the duke and they live together as a menage a trois for 25 years and i found that concept fascinating
9282259 this was the gathering place for all the kids in green ridge
9282260 joe wouldnt back down from a fight he was fearless
9282261 there were no drugs or anything like that we played baseball went to the movies
9282262 the first principle of politics the foundational principle i learned in the 1950s in my grandpops kitchen when i was about 12 or 13 years old
9282263 once we spent our limit on penny candy from simmeys charlie roth larry orr tommy bell and i would head down to the roosie roosevelt theater for the 12 cent double feature usually a pair of westerns or tarzan
9282264 this was our first grade classroom we sat right here biden and bell
9282265 joe biden lived here for 10 years and in this house
9282266 everybody that leaves here they stick to their roots they have wonderful values religion is a big part of it and the kids all learned how to get along with each other because there were so many of them
9282267 and you know its great that its the u s open
9282268 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9282269 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9282270 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9282271 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9282272 i am very proud of all the people who have supported me and i feel even more hate for this tyranny
9282273 it is a material and emotional recognition of the mistakes that our country has done to yours during the colonial era
9282274 the airport resumed operations at about 11 00am 0400 gmt
9282275 the first flight will land soon all services at the airport are back to normal protesters started leaving the airport this morning there are not many left now
9282276 since they say the waters will be here until the end of october im making a boat
9282277 we will be able to use it to get to the market and come back with supplies
9282278 from tonight we will begin supplying them with cooked food
9282279 we will only be able to tell the extent after the water recedes
9282280 i am much more comfortable knowing i can be out there all the time
9282281 if we have a two minute delay so what it is too big of a play not to get the call right
9282282 but when will the buffs get a real quarterback in there instead of the coachs kid
9282283 it really makes me mad ill go to battle for cody hawkins every day and i have
9282284 being the coachs son theres a lot of flak he gets from fans cody has great character dealing with that the way he has is tremendous
9282285 i just smile at those people because they have no idea how he gets the job done
9282286 sometimes i cant see cody back behind the line but i know the ball is coming and its on a dime
9282287 ive met kids who knew i am the quarterback and had no idea my dad is the coach
9282288 and ive had people who wanted to meet me and talk about my dad the whole time
9282289 im always going to be the coachs kid id like to be cody hawkins but im not ashamed of being the son of the coach because dan hawkins is a pretty good dude im proud of him i look up to him
9282290 it was cold outside and he was out there throwing the football around
9282291 i thought who is this kid he could have been inside doing something else when i found out it was coach hawks son i thought wow but thats cody he loves football he loves to compete he loves the games he loves the practices
9282292 because high school film is usually from someones father trying to hold a camera still on the sidelines
9282293 you really dont want to call a guy out and have him say hey ive been here for five years everybody was awesome about it but i was very careful not to go overboard
9282294 becoming a vocal leader allows more of his intangibles to come through
9282295 thats always been one of codys strengths in high school he was able to galvanize the whole group and be even more of a spiritual type of leader i think hes more comfortable and better able doing that
9282296 i talk faster than most people i walk faster than most people
9282297 i eat faster than most people i listen to music louder than most people
9282298 if you put in all the qualities needed for a no huddle offense and translate that into a person youd probably get me were going to play fast and we have a chance to get the defense on their heels thats what i like
9282299 he knows how much i believe in him i told him to let his defense work he just couldnt find the strike zone thats disappointing for him and us
9282300 anytime you are trying to catch a team and you have a window of opportunity and you dont capitalize its tough
9282301 its been huge that we have gotten better in the second half but it has been one of the most disappointing aspects
9282302 at one point and time this year we led the league in double plays and we fell off the map when you dont pitch well you dont turn double plays now they are starting to show up again because we have pitched better shocker
9282303 he dealt with this as long as he could he needs to get it fixed
9282304 i think its special for everyone at csu and everyone at cu
9282305 this game has national recognition from coast to coast being played at invesco field at mile high
9282306 these are our two signature universities they are underfunded we think thats a disgrace
9282307 being late in the game and being up at this altitude i knew they were going to be worn out by the fourth quarter
9282308 we started doing our quick offense and basically i dont think they could breathe we were just more determined than they were
9282309 he tried to throw back across his body and the only guy i know who can do that is john elway we arent john elway yet
9282310 you need that playing quarterback he could have easily hung his head and let things go downhill
9282311 if our authorities cant handle the problem they should resign
9282312 officials have to look out for the needs of the people instead of themselves
9282313 we have to let them know that things must change
9282314 but we have to keep trying we cant sit at home in fear with our arms crossed and do nothing
9282315 im here because im indignant and disgusted with the terrible governments we have in this country
9282316 heute sind die handlichen abspielger te aus dem alltag vieler menschen nicht mehr wegzudenken in 41 prozent aller haushalte in deutschland befindet sich mindestens ein mp3 oder ein mp4 spieler
9282317 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9282318 it was kind of a timing post and i knew he was going to be open
9282319 i just let it go and he went up and got it
9282320 well start clark and if it looks appropriate to get devlin in well get him in
9282321 its like watching the two finalists in an ugly dog contest
9282322 but its important for him to pitch before the season ends
9282323 everybody goes through it i just have to wait for my arm strength and my arm power to come back
9282324 pompeii and the roman villa art and culture around the bay of naples
9282325 nobody can say that the party isnt unified after the jobs that hillary clinton bill clinton and barack obama did in their speeches
9282326 obama showed that he will hit back democrats worried about having another john kerry on their hand were appeased
9282327 disaffected democratic women are not going to vote for an evangelical pro life creationist
9282328 there is plenty of anecdotal and survey evidence that not all clinton supporters have embraced
9282329 but in all likelihood most liberal leaning clinton supporters will slide over to the obama column
9282330 you know john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives
9282331 an outstanding choice that should be extremely reassuring to the conservative base
9282332 gives us confidence he will keep his pledges to voters regarding the kinds of justices he would nominate to the supreme court
9282333 you want to kind of stop the momentum and change the momentum
9282334 im a very intense guy you know i was born and raised in puerto rico and i guess thats the way we play it has nothing to do with showing up or trying to put your opponent down
9282335 im going to have to call my mother because i guess what i said wasnt good for her i have to talk to her im a preachers son
9282336 id say today was kind of a must for us really
9282337 this late in the season we cant afford to be losing three or four games in a row we are going to lose some but at the same time weve got to hold it to a minimum
9282338 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan
9282339 ive approached this preseason differently because of my health and because of my off season training i look forward to having a great season
9282340 in your mind you feel like you can play that you can still compete but when your mind and your body are not in accord its not going to work in the national football league
9282341 if youre old enough to fight for your country at 18 youre old enough to drink legally
9282342 to support an informed and dispassionate public debate over the effects of the 21 year old drinking age
9282343 new ideas about the best ways to prepare young adults to make responsible decisions about alcohol
9282344 the optimist sees opportunity in every danger the pessimist sees danger in every opportunity
9282345 im going to ride it all the way to australia
9282346 we will finish 12 2 go to and win the super bowl
9282347 woodhead ive made a 50 bet with my friend that you will pick the broncos to have a 12 4 record as you do every year youll be wrong again the broncos will be 4 12
9282348 your raise has been doubled 0 percent times two equals 0 percent raise
9282349 after you meet her and know everything is done by hand with love and care
9282350 the world as a whole and our country included has appeared to behave as if these fossil fuels were inexhaustible
9282351 what well see shortly is that as everyone will know if you stop and think about it that oil is finite
9282352 it is a little disappointing to see the lack of interest in roscoes depth of knowledge on this issue
9282353 he tries to educate the leadership on both sides democrats and republicans unfortunately they dont listen closely enough
9282354 would require sharp reductions in oil consumption and the competition for increasingly scarce energy would drive up prices possibly to unprecedented levels causing severe economic damage while these consequences would be felt globally the united states as the largest consumer of oil and one of the nations most heavily dependent on oil for transportation may be especially vulnerable
9282355 you will never know that oil has peaked until you look back at it
9282356 this plateau in global production weve been on now for three years may in fact not be peaking it may be a little plateau there may be a pickup
9282357 the total commitment of world war ii the technology focus of putting a man on the moon and the urgency of the manhattan project
9282358 as a team we felt more comfortable as the game went on i have a lot to improve on and have to just keep getting better
9282359 its always good to come out and get a win in game no 1 no matter who the opponent is were excited about playing a conference game next week at wyoming and well be ready for a tough one in laramie
9282360 were two different people im trying to make my own legacy i guess you could say
9282361 i thought we were the tightest football team ive ever been around when we came out for pregame
9282362 we had a bunch of players out there today who were playing in their very first college football game it was evident we have to develop as a team very rapidly there were too many times the ball was on the ground four fumbles two lost and we just cant have that happen here
9282363 i thought there was good continuity when shea was out there
9282364 i thought we needed his presence as a senior because we have so many young players but we have to play firmer up front and play better around him
9282365 i dont think in college football theres an easy game
9282366 overall we were pretty happy with our performance but we have a lot of room to improve we have a lot of room to grow
9282367 i thought we gave a good showing today against a quality i a school
9282368 you want to be crowded at a lot of different positions but yeah we have more depth at linebacker than view slide show of broncos cardinals game view slide show of broncos training camp watch video of the broncos cheerleaders at their calendar signing read lindsay jones entries on the all things broncos blog ask mike klis about the team or nfl in the broncos mailbag read the latest broncos commentaries by jim armstrong post photos of you and your loved ones showing broncos spirit play pickem for the upcoming broncos game weve had in the past
9282369 we didnt really make a big splash in free agency this year
9282370 we got boss bailey and dewayne robertson and we had a great draft but last year it felt like we had the playmakers to have a great season for whatever reason it didnt work out we got rid of a couple guys who coaches i guess felt were a problem with the team last year now the chemistry is well and i think we benefited from the moves that we made
9282371 talent wise and the togetherness the camaraderie its all there
9282372 i dont want to make any predictions im not a big prediction guy but i think we are as talented as ive seen since ive been here
9282373 a lot of good players are cut in the national football league
9282374 we want towson to be a more vibrant place and that requires additional people living in the core
9282375 we like towson as it was and i realize it sounds old fashioned but i think theyve overdone the building
9282376 when you get that amount of people 50 feet from you thats going to be awesome
9282377 towson i think will be very similar to silver spring
9282378 in terms of what theyve done how theyve laid development out and how theyve addressed walkability
9282379 which is a big concern because theres going to be a lot of residential projects and not a lot of people buying
9282380 we dont want to have a lot of projects that are not successful sitting empty or rented out to college students and not attracting the type of people who we want in towson
9282381 we desperately needed them the two points it was quite obvious especially after newcastle winning against melbourne last night
9282382 we cant control that all we can control is what we do we didnt start as well as we wanted to but geez we came back well
9282383 we had a little bit of last weeks jitters ran over the sideline and gave away some penalties
9282384 but then we just got back to the basics as soon as we got that we got some ball back started to build some pressure and got some tries
9282385 wade was disappointed with a couple of decisions and he spoke to the referee and he felt it wasnt the right way
9282386 wade has just got to get back to whats been working for him and hopefully nothing will come out of it and hell be right for next week
9282387 mccain needs to continue to make the case that he is ready to lead and barack obama is not that is the essential definition of this election
9282388 it can never be mean or angry but john mccain is now beautifully set up to continue his fundamental message which is the world is a dangerous place put somebody in charge who knows what hes doing
9282389 needs the convention to really stick it to obama because obama is still more undefined than people think and voters are showing they are nervous about him
9282390 its been a wonderful journey and its good to get the two points today so it makes it a little bit better
9282391 were probably not happy with the way we played the wet conditions didnt help but at the same time we cant really start big games in that fashion because its going to be too hard to dig ourselves out of those holes
9282392 weve been a bit scratchy the last couple of weeks its just a matter of putting it together
9282393 i think not having mick ennis there today didnt help our combination around the ruck suffered early we just didnt gel real well
9282394 in the end we got the two points but our defence just needs to be a bit better too
9282395 its not a great ground for rugby league obviously theres reasons why we play here but i think it should be reserved for the big ones
9282396 it does lack a bit of atmosphere and i just think the fans probably come here and go home wondering what could be better
9282397 and now ladies and gentlemen may the better man emoige victorious
9282398 go back to your corners and when the bell rings come out fighting
9282399 all we know is they must have missed their jump site
9282400 we dont know anything until the x rays come back
9282401 yalls heart yalls spirit yall mean a whole lot to me
9282402 my job demanded a lot and i gave it 100 percent
9282403 i kept up with every one of my male co workers but toward the end of my 19 years at goodyear i began to suspect that i wasnt getting paid as much as men doing the same job an anonymous note in my mailbox confirmed that i was right despite praising me for my work goodyear gave me smaller raises than my male co managers over and over
9282404 i do not want mr ms nice guy as my attorney i want a real fighter even if it costs me more money
9282405 theres no immediate need for elk grove to add rooftops
9282406 theres definitely a chance this is not the final roster we have to wait and see
9282407 an open door policy with all of us he wants you to come in and talk to him about whatever is on your mind
9282408 if theres anything he doesnt approve of youre going to run at the end
9282409 im bracing myself for whats going to happen the good thing is that ive gotten a lot of support from the roman administration
9282410 the one thing the coaches preached was doing things the right way
9282411 and once you stepped inside the lines of the field it was all about football and winning they had an all business approach
9282412 he probably makes us run a little more than coach murph
9282413 from everything im hearing were too young from the coaches on down
9282414 but im confident we have a lot of good talent the important thing for us is to get the younger guys to stay focused in practices and games throughout the year
9282415 the good thing is that were flying under the radar right now
9282416 everything you hear about is st josephs prep and cardinal ohara if people want to make us the underdogs thats fine with us
9282417 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over we would have a serious problem if we took it to parliament right now
9282418 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9282419 they are avoiding the issue they dont want a status of forces agreement they dont want a security agreement
9282420 what happened in georgia is a good sign one that means america is no longer the sole world power setting the rules of the game
9282421 there is a balance in the world now russia is resurging which is good for us for the entire middle east
9282422 this russian invasion of georgia is a turning point in the relations of the atlantic community with russia including of course turkey
9282423 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9282424 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9282425 non bcs teams should get a shot at a championship every year
9282426 we never were able to get the defense a rest because we couldnt move the ball effectively
9282427 its a high possibility this is the missing swimmer from a week ago
9282428 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9282429 it was kind of a timing post and i knew he was going to be open
9282430 i just let it go and he went up and got it
9282431 well start clark and if it looks appropriate to get devlin in well get him in
9282432 he runs around he is a very tough kid for not being very big
9282433 running c passing f i really failed on that one
9282434 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
9282435 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
9282436 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
9282437 i just liked our demeanor its great to see the team mature and grow up like that i was pleased with the way they responded
9282438 he had a couple of shaky plays but what can you say about him
9282439 should he be out there medically right now he beat all the odds he looked good and did a nice job
9282440 i just think that last years team was a selfish team
9282441 i sat in here last year and told you guys that this year we had all of our starters on special teams running down and making plays all of those guys played on special teams a year ago and they are a year older our teams finally looked at it as one third of the game we lost a lot of games last year because of that one third of the game
9282442 it was tough keeping your head on straight theres so much to think about
9282443 daryll was named no 1 so it was good just to get in there with some of the guys from the first team
9282444 but you can just put it away for the time being
9282445 i think there are some advantages to deferring but we have played in an awful lot of games where when we win the toss we take the ball and we have done well in a lot of those games as well
9282446 we feel that with so many levels of judgment that go into the force out call it creates a more consistent play when either you get your feet down for a complete pass or you do not
9282447 its been a very long week and i think a lot of misspent energy has been taken up by obvious press media players everybody its just so mentally draining to be in this position to listen to read to hear all the b s this week im spent im exhausted i didnt want to finish the last two tournaments like this
9282448 do you know what im sick and tired of all this nonsense
9282449 im absolutely spent i cant waste any more energy on this if i get the call im ready to play and trust me ill do my job
9282450 id say right now im annoyed at not figuring out this golf course very well
9282451 its not the kind of buzz you want to play golf on trust me the kind of nonsense thats been in my head for a whole week is not the right kind of pressure its nonsense
9282452 youve read it youve wrote it some of you might be guilty or not i dont know but boy what one hell of a week
9282453 thats pressure thats what you thrive on to have to read all that nonsense listen to all that its totally different pressure ive performed in the big tournaments weve all seen what happens when you get batted for a week it happened earlier on in the year im tired of it
9282454 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9282455 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over
9282456 we would have a serious problem if we took it to parliament right now
9282457 thats what keeps it from looking like the rest of lake tahoe
9282458 they are more bloodthirsty they make their victims disappear they mutilate them they cut their ears off just as in the case of my daughter we do not know where she is
9282459 the message is get to work or well hold you accountable were angry
9282460 this is crazy we just wanted to come out and let everybody know we are for real and i think we did that
9282461 we are not going to back down the rain was not going to stop us
9282462 we still need to execute and have things to improve on
9282463 we could have gotten the record i thought we were going to get it
9282464 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
9282465 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
9282466 by and large they are champing at the bit they are ready to go
9282467 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
9282468 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
9282469 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
9282470 these kids may have quit at some point but the big thing is a lot of people have quit on them
9282471 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9282472 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9282473 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9282474 i am working on this book deal and i am going to be the new emily post
9282475 i will be giving people advice on my experience being a countess
9282476 a lot of interest but nothing has been signed yet
9282477 if you dont have a transmission system to get it there it becomes useless
9282478 long distance transmission is only economic if it is built to high capacity which means that there must be a large amount of generation capacity in one place
9282479 the football monopoly in this town is officially over there
9282480 when i first got hurt they were talking about four or five weeks
9282481 i had to step up in the pocket on that play somebody came from the outside but damian williams made a big block and i saw the safety im supposed to read looking at me flat footed if hes flat footed and rojos running it aint even close
9282482 i had to go all out i didnt save anything you only get one first game each year
9282483 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9282484 its still early we still got a long way to go
9282485 but weve got a good group of guys here who can do it
9282486 youre trying to win a championship and ive always said in the course of winning a championship there will be some damage to some folks in order to do that thats the sacrifice thats the cost thats the price of a championship somebody has to do something that theyve never done before somebody has to play more games do more than theyve done before thats the price that you pay
9282487 the end of our careers came prematurely we didnt expect it one day it was there the next day it was gone but these guys are making history right now going forward and carrying the tradition of lincoln football it was a real moving experience for all of us who were there
9282488 this is like an opening night for a show on broadway
9282489 i have a whole lot of pride just seeing it this is fantastic
9282490 if you would have heard the comments around alumni and the people who came out for the first time it was just like a new baby being born
9282491 we talked about it all week about not getting caught up in the emotions
9282492 we prepared them we wore our game uniforms last saturday just so the guys could feel the excitement we knew it would be a nice atmosphere and they did a good job of controlling their emotions
9282493 football at any major university is like apple pie they go together
9282494 all we know is they must have missed their jump site
9282495 we dont know anything until the x rays come back
9282496 yalls heart yalls spirit yall mean a whole lot to me
9282497 they got a bad rap a few weeks ago that they didnt really deserve and im glad to get this one for them
9282498 i think the biggest challenge was just being good on the restarts and getting away
9282499 nobody was going to touch that no 18 those guys were scary fast it was a lot of fun but he was in a different zip code
9282500 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9282501 i told the kids im going to put that in the playbook
9282502 once we got up it seems like they kind of let up a little bit
9282503 we started out a little slow but once we got going it started to kick in
9282504 i knew we might have a hard time they just have too much speed for us
9282505 is as sharp now as it was when i was 21
9282506 we just like to get in a circle and shoot
9282507 an open door policy with all of us he wants you to come in and talk to him about whatever is on your mind
9282508 if theres anything he doesnt approve of youre going to run at the end
9282509 im bracing myself for whats going to happen the good thing is that ive gotten a lot of support from the roman administration
9282510 the one thing the coaches preached was doing things the right way
9282511 and once you stepped inside the lines of the field it was all about football and winning they had an all business approach
9282512 he probably makes us run a little more than coach murph
9282513 from everything im hearing were too young from the coaches on down
9282514 but im confident we have a lot of good talent the important thing for us is to get the younger guys to stay focused in practices and games throughout the year
9282515 the good thing is that were flying under the radar right now
9282516 everything you hear about is st josephs prep and cardinal ohara if people want to make us the underdogs thats fine with us
9282517 we will be able to pretty much lock down this city
9282518 people should be confident we will be able to handle this very very well we cant promise nothing will happen but it certainly will be a tremendous force of law enforcement and military here
9282519 nobody had to tell me twice to get out this time
9282520 we had to get rescued from our roof after katrina i wasnt about to go through anything like that again
9282521 katrina was some hard earned experience now were putting that experience to work
9282522 its not the wind or the water im worried about
9282523 the police couldnt protect anybody the last time and i have no confidence things will be any different now
9282524 what is that keith richards said about the rolling stones nobody gets out of this band alive
9282525 we didnt come out of spring training and say lets not play well and get hot in the end
9282526 we are very disappointed in how we played early we had the same sense of urgency we just didnt get the results theres something to be said when you look and theres no cavalry coming that you respond its time for us to win now because we are about out of time
9282527 there are not a lot of people following the rockies a lot of them have written us off other than my parents those are the only people who call and remind me that we are rockies starter jorge de la rosa went 2 1 in four starts in august and lowered his era from 6 94 to 5 60 nick wass the associated press creeping back into this thing
9282528 but i found my old topo map last night and it shows a 1 500 foot climb over 5 miles to sylvia
9282529 i remember that trail being a stroll through meadows until the end when you climb to lyons lake i cant believe you gain so much altitude
9282530 because it has a lake and it has a mouse the other trail had quail and rabbits but i like the lake
9282531 we think we have the best 53 man roster we think we have pretty good depth all around
9282532 andy reid said it best he improved from the first game to the second game and hes a big enough guy who can do it
9282533 he showed ability to be a fullback hes the one fullback on our roster hes going to get a lot of work
9282534 from how hes played thats definitely not the case he was blowing it up in there his aggressiveness and toughness the thing he needs more experience at is his angles and how he positions his body to sustain blocks better we think he wants to be the starting fullback for us and obviously he is right now
9282535 jerome is a great guy who has worked his way back from a lot of adversity
9282536 i dont think he will have trouble finding work every year he showed determination to come back hes played well
9282537 chris has not played a whole lot this season but hopefully he will get back this week
9282538 he was not a real difficult decision he made a ton of plays and that is what you want your middle linebacker to do
9282539 competed well but we thought matt was a better fit for us
9282540 we still have a couple of days of rehab here before we start practicing for st louis but right now we think he is ready to go
9282541 ive approached this preseason differently because of my health and because of my off season training i look forward to having a great season
9282542 in your mind you feel like you can play that you can still compete but when your mind and your body are not in accord its not going to work in the national football league
9282543 theres definitely a chance this is not the final roster we have to wait and see
9282544 you want to kind of stop the momentum and change the momentum
9282545 im a very intense guy you know i was born and raised in puerto rico and i guess thats the way we play it has nothing to do with showing up or trying to put your opponent down
9282546 im going to have to call my mother because i guess what i said wasnt good for her i have to talk to her im a preachers son
9282547 id say today was kind of a must for us really
9282548 this late in the season we cant afford to be losing three or four games in a row we are going to lose some but at the same time weve got to hold it to a minimum
9282549 and you know its great that its the u s open
9282550 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9282551 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9282552 then when you have moments like that on the court you know you feel like its all worth it
9282553 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9282554 its like watching the two finalists in an ugly dog contest
9282555 but its important for him to pitch before the season ends
9282556 everybody goes through it i just have to wait for my arm strength and my arm power to come back
9282557 we came in with the game plan that we were going to load up and run the ball so i was pretty prepared for it
9282558 i just wanted to let people know what i can do and help my teammates out
9282559 we wanted to get darel scott some confidence and once he got it he was gone
9282560 normally he would break some of those runs i dont think he quite had his third gear today
9282561 this is not like a moral victory i dont believe in moral victories
9282562 we had opportunities and we let them get away were greatly disappointed
9282563 we didnt think he had a chance to stay healthy
9282564 itd be nice to have him now but who could have forecast all hed go through to come back the way he did
9282565 i know him as a man that answers straight questions with straight answers
9282566 and hes been a sox fan since before he was a senator like most fans whenever i see him he wants to know if we have enough pitching
9282567 a couple months ago when he asked that question i told him pitching is like votes you can never be comfortable you have enough
9282568 we think we have the best 53 man roster we think we have pretty good depth all around
9282569 andy reid said it best he improved from the first game to the second game and hes a big enough guy who can do it
9282570 he showed ability to be a fullback hes the one fullback on our roster hes going to get a lot of work
9282571 from how hes played thats definitely not the case he was blowing it up in there his aggressiveness and toughness the thing he needs more experience at is his angles and how he positions his body to sustain blocks better we think he wants to be the starting fullback for us and obviously he is right now
9282572 jerome is a great guy who has worked his way back from a lot of adversity
9282573 i dont think he will have trouble finding work every year he showed determination to come back hes played well
9282574 chris has not played a whole lot this season but hopefully he will get back this week
9282575 he was not a real difficult decision he made a ton of plays and that is what you want your middle linebacker to do
9282576 competed well but we thought matt was a better fit for us
9282577 we still have a couple of days of rehab here before we start practicing for st louis but right now we think he is ready to go
9282578 i appeal to all not to mix politics and sport
9282579 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9282580 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9282581 it was kind of a timing post and i knew he was going to be open
9282582 i just let it go and he went up and got it
9282583 well start clark and if it looks appropriate to get devlin in well get him in
9282584 for us the palio is about competition and tradition and where you belong you live here you live in your neighborhood and all week we have special dinners special meetings its emotional yes but its all friendly i dont know that you have anything like it in the states i dont think there is really anything like it in the world
9282585 its just so mentally draining to be in this position im spent im exhausted do you know what im sick and tired of all this nonsense
9282586 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on the front nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round for a while there there certainly was a chance of 59
9282587 i have spent long periods of time with him in the past two years hes been alert hes been steady
9282588 the late prime minister bhutto or her husband or it was a joint account
9282589 if russia wants to change saakashvili and that was its aim here then its steps here were absolutely stupid
9282590 when we have a threat to our internal safety a military occupation then all georgians despite our political views or differences between us we must unite
9282591 even the radical opposition that says all of this was the result of the failure of saakashvili does not question the territorial integrity of georgia
9282592 if they found someone who could replace saakashvili he would have to explain why russias invasion was good
9282593 as for saakashvili and his regime it is true that we do not like him
9282594 the number of addicted women coming to us requesting help is increasing every day
9282595 we want to teach them a craft with the hope theyll respond positively and overcome their drug habits
9282596 im always telling them to look closely at what people are wearing in their neighborhoods because they can make those styles of clothes and earn money selling them
9282597 it was my decision to come here because i wanted to learn how to make things i can sell
9282598 when these women use drugs they feel isolated from society they think other people around them dont value them
9282599 to learn a craft so i could earn some money working at home
9282600 my children already have many problems and i have to leave them home alone to come here
9282601 its no problem to find if you have the money because there are so many people selling it
9282602 it would be good if people couldnt find it so easily
9282603 it was also the idea that wherever mexicans are outside of mexico that that is aztl n
9282604 thats because they believe that this was a ceremonial center of the mexica
9282605 but thats a lot different than saying its aztl n
9282606 but the bad thing is that the older generations didnt leave us any writings or anything like that
9282607 upsell now there is a greater variety of stateroom categories and more affordable pricing gaps between categories creating great new up selling opportunities for you
9282608 at last there was a group of government officials with common sense who saw that there was no compelling public need for adding onerous regulation to cruise itineraries
9282609 san francisco cruises to canada and mexico with stops in california cities will remain safe
9282610 they see where its grown with their own eyes and pick it with their own hands they dont need a sign in a store to tell them how fresh it is
9282611 wouldnt pay us what we needed to break even and make a little money
9282612 the you pick is the reason ive been able to do this for so long
9282613 most people who go out to pick fruits and vegetables use it as a recreational activity so youll get all kinds of customers on the weekend and no one on wednesday
9282614 its a cheap way to get exercise entertainment and food with little cost the trick is getting the customer to come out and pick versus when the crop is actually ready
9282615 but even if we accept a new museum was needed it should be in a style close to that of the ancient buildings
9282616 we will just sing three hymns it wont be a big ceremony
9282617 i dont know how many of us will be there people are afraid the fact is that we are subject to religious persecution
9282618 he runs around he is a very tough kid for not being very big
9282619 running c passing f i really failed on that one
9282620 as we reduce the size of our fleet and take other actions to enable united to compete in this environment of record fuel prices we must take the difficult but necessary steps to reduce the number of people we have to run our operation
9282621 it was tough keeping your head on straight theres so much to think about
9282622 daryll was named no 1 so it was good just to get in there with some of the guys from the first team
9282623 but you can just put it away for the time being
9282624 they got 11 hits off me and i felt like maybe three or four were hit hard
9282625 i would say 75 percent to 80 percent this is where we are
9282626 were talking on another situation but i dont really think its going to happen
9282627 now ill have to learn a new street in philadelphia and party down there
9282628 maybe well go by rocky balboa and hang out there
9282629 if im here for a month and they want me to pinch hit every day ill do whatever it takes
9282630 its just fun to be in that atmosphere of being in the playoff race again at this point in time im playing for one thing whenever you put the uniform on from day one you want to win a world series or a stanley cup
9282631 he cant be a bullpen guy at this point we cant put him in the rotation so in fairness to him maybe the last month of the season he can hook on with another club and get an opportunity to start
9282632 for the last 45 days kris has felt really well
9282633 hes ready to go obviously he knew this was a year for the unknown from an overall recovery perspective but the most important thing is that he feels strong he feels good hes ready to pitch at the major league level
9282634 nuffnang wild live blogging not so direct from sri hartamas anymore 21 6 2008
9282635 dillon mcclernon has what they think is a concussion tests taken on his neck and back came back negative we got pretty lucky
9282636 its a lot of fun and it helps with football it makes you faster stronger and quicker
9282637 that shows the kind of depth we have on this team
9282638 i just liked our demeanor its great to see the team mature and grow up like that i was pleased with the way they responded
9282639 he had a couple of shaky plays but what can you say about him
9282640 should he be out there medically right now he beat all the odds he looked good and did a nice job
9282641 i just think that last years team was a selfish team
9282642 i sat in here last year and told you guys that this year we had all of our starters on special teams running down and making plays all of those guys played on special teams a year ago and they are a year older our teams finally looked at it as one third of the game we lost a lot of games last year because of that one third of the game
9282643 its a combination of a winning team good players a great ballpark and great fan support
9282644 i take him as being probably the best driver on the circuit you never know what he can come up with during a race or what him and crew chief chad knaus can come up with in their cars to make it fast
9282645 we talked about it this week my trainer and i we were kind of going over the guys that were really going to be tough and it goes without saying jimmie johnson has proven that he can do it when it matters i think thats one of the guys youre going to have to beat youre going to have to beat jimmie to be the champion
9282646 were trying to get into his head were having fun with it every chance i get i say something to him
9282647 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9282648 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9282649 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9282650 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9282651 we have these wonderful groups that come together and great recommendations come out and the majority of them never see the light of day
9282652 i dont think its malevolence and i dont think its incompetence its that theres nobody in each of these agencies who is responsible for doing it
9282653 is a part of the problem as well we keep going in different directions
9282654 these are the promises we make for these system kids
9282655 we really need broad agreement on what are the main issues
9282656 she is smart compassionate and a tireless advocate for improving the lives of young people
9282657 dillon mcclernon has what they think is a concussion tests taken on his neck and back came back negative we got pretty lucky
9282658 its a lot of fun and it helps with football it makes you faster stronger and quicker
9282659 that shows the kind of depth we have on this team
9282660 they got 11 hits off me and i felt like maybe three or four were hit hard
9282661 i would say 75 percent to 80 percent this is where we are
9282662 were talking on another situation but i dont really think its going to happen
9282663 now ill have to learn a new street in philadelphia and party down there
9282664 maybe well go by rocky balboa and hang out there
9282665 if im here for a month and they want me to pinch hit every day ill do whatever it takes
9282666 its just fun to be in that atmosphere of being in the playoff race again at this point in time im playing for one thing whenever you put the uniform on from day one you want to win a world series or a stanley cup
9282667 he cant be a bullpen guy at this point we cant put him in the rotation so in fairness to him maybe the last month of the season he can hook on with another club and get an opportunity to start
9282668 for the last 45 days kris has felt really well
9282669 hes ready to go obviously he knew this was a year for the unknown from an overall recovery perspective but the most important thing is that he feels strong he feels good hes ready to pitch at the major league level
9282670 its a combination of a winning team good players a great ballpark and great fan support
9282671 aonde foi que voc viu o carro pela ultima vez
9282672 i think there are some advantages to deferring but we have played in an awful lot of games where when we win the toss we take the ball and we have done well in a lot of those games as well
9282673 we feel that with so many levels of judgment that go into the force out call it creates a more consistent play when either you get your feet down for a complete pass or you do not
9282674 if you think i look healthy and great and i have hiv then the person youre having sex with might have it too
9282675 she always talks about it around my friends because a lot of them dont know as much as i do
9282676 im trying to reach one person and get that one person to change their life
9282677 i wanted to so badly and im scared of heights
9282678 i thought it was a gay white mans disease it didnt feel like it had hit our community yet
9282679 sometimes god needs to get your attention and he will take away everything you have your house your car your health your spouse and when i got the diagnosis all that was happening to me
9282680 all the nice stuff they were saying about you a few minutes before thats all out the window
9282681 i had to change my mindset that i was worth more than sex
9282682 at 36 i just learned what it is to love me
9282683 if i just expect god to give me a sunny happy day every day of my life then am i really trusting god
9282684 its so insidious the way it turns your mind against you
9282685 its the closest i can imagine to hearing voices or being possessed it really does feel alien like something else is at work inside you
9282686 the most tragic consequence is the psychiatric spiral it causes
9282687 we know children of mothers with postpartum depression have more emotional problems as adults for instance they struggle to develop and sustain healthy relationships
9282688 new mothers are very sensitive to the idea they should be good mothers that their maternal function is paramount
9282689 when they perceive theyre failing in that role it creates both shame and a tendency to conceal it
9282690 the goal is to make postpartum depression a more mainstream conversation
9282691 thats the first step in getting women to realize they can do something about the problem
9282692 i would hope anyone who feels the way i did would see a doctor and if the doctor brushes her off she should find another
9282693 no one should have to deal with it themselves no one deserves to feel that way
9282694 i wanted to see if it would get better but i didnt think it would
9282695 i want to stay here we are playing really well at the right time
9282696 when he finds pockets on the field and when he finds space hes excellent on the ball
9282697 he plays the attacking side of the ball and the mental side probably better than most
9282698 its one of those things that is like damn but its nothing to panic about its one of those games and the thing is the team is hungry right now
9282699 we definitely want to prove ourselves especially in a big game
9282700 we want to show why were in first place and get that ball running again
9282701 its kind of touted as the next gold rush yet there are some people who are very concerned will it come to pass
9282702 for all the seeming hype we actually believe this heavy focus on gas shales is very well placed
9282703 in terms of activity this is big on anybodys radar screen whether its the service industry or the producers
9282704 she should be a huge energy boost for the convention and for the nominee
9282705 because there is nothing john mccain likes to do more than the unexpected
9282706 for palin itll be like going from regional theater to a broadway hit overnight
9282707 i did not do what i wanted to do 100 percent
9282708 i did not do what i wanted to do 100 percent
9282709 it makes it seem more like a real college instead of a community college
9282710 it might attract more people to come to the school
9282711 we watched him play since he was five years old and it just continues our family tradition of being able to watch our son play soccer
9282712 i was like oh i almost didnt know what to do it was so big
9282713 i was quicker but he did a good job and he didnt let me fight my usual fight
9282714 i am not too disappointed i fought well here and i like boxing in berlin i hope for another chance at the title
9282715 teach both you know dont be afraid of information healthy debate is so important and its so valuable in our schools i am a proponent of teaching both
9282716 its ok to let kids know that there are theories out there
9282717 my dad did talk a lot about his theories of evolution
9282718 he would show us fossils and say how old do you think these are
9282719 im not going to pretend i know how all this came to be
9282720 to be honest with you ive been surprised that ive been out for so long with the national team
9282721 i was sort of disappointed a couple of times that i didnt get called in recently
9282722 but at the end of the day i cant do anything about it but keep playing ball to the best of my ability with the dynamo so i can get looked at
9282723 this is not something you buy to take the kids out flying
9282724 its not easy to fly and not easy to maintain if you buy one of these you must know what youre doing
9282725 and no the national championship air races operational people the air bosses the pilots and crews we do everything we can to maintain safety we know what were doing we fly the airplanes a lot my crew knows the airplane backward i think were doing the best we can and the only thing i can say is that things happen outside of our control and thats when accidents happen
9282726 everyone from the faa to the air races personnel to my crew the pilots everybody is focused on safety and its not just because of last year
9282727 but just like anyone else you have to prove yourself
9282728 if they are going to race that close to you they want to make sure you know what youre doing
9282729 it probably is 10 minutes for the whole race but its the most focused 10 minutes of your life
9282730 imagine strapping your butt to an engine and going 180 miles an hour with seven other airplanes all around you
9282731 even as late as lunchtime today thursday we believed we had secured a new investment package to ensure future operations but the actions of creditors meant we could not continue flying
9282732 surats civic body has the capacity to recover the funds spent on infrastructure development surat and the other three cities of gujarat are good bets among the present lot of ulbs
9282733 surat is witnessing a phenomenal growth and by the next decade this would be indias best city in terms of infrastructure and all around development
9282734 we appeal to the people not to provoke police and troopers and protest peacefully
9282735 going to take it on as the first test of his leadership
9282736 in the last few months the isi has been hyperactive in many ways and we are concerned that kind of activity could increase because thats what they know how to do best
9282737 i was thrown out of my home some 30 years back when i suffered from tb my husband left me on road and i know how i managed to survive and get myself treated by visiting different hospitals in the capital
9282738 my husband refused to accept the child and asked me to take her to my parents home
9282739 there was nobody to help me i wanted to get rid of this man many years back but i remained quiet because that would have spoilt my daughters life but now she is married and well settled so i want a divorce from him
9282740 i know i wont be able to live long but i want to take revenge on my husband who has ruined my life
9282741 there are terrorists around and we have to flush them out
9282742 were not just imagining an attack on the transportation plan now we can see that its real
9282743 its just a pain in the ass cause theres nothing going on here thats illegal im not worried about it its just its just annoying
9282744 you know theyre intimidating people from even coming to the demonstrations so theyre intimidating everybody not just you know the anarchists or the whatever
9282745 theyre intimidating everybody when this news gets out from coming downtown to engage in even legally and permitted marches and the whole thing
9282746 our job is to take every dangerous item out of their hands so they cant utilize them we have extensive investigative work complete with a number of confidential reliable sources that have worked inside this area this anarchist area
9282747 we know these items were going to be used because we had sources that were working inside this organization
9282748 it looks like the minneapolis police are going to attempt and shut down this house on code violations like they shut down the convergence space in st paul
9282749 we are going to attempt to prevent that were going to attempt to reopen the convergence site you dont get to just remove people from their houses and board them up because the police dont like what youre doing inside there
9282750 when you conspire to do that its an agreement beforehand to do it the agreement itself is criminal its often what they get drug dealers for its often what they get organized crime figures for conspiracy a separate and independent crime
9282751 we were able to talk the lady with all the clothes into paying for a second cabin
9282752 she ended up with two cabins one for her the other just for her wardrobe
9282753 but it wasnt so easy meeting the request of a passenger who demanded diet coke
9282754 usually well go out of our way and sometimes at great expense to meet a passengers dietary needs
9282755 seeing another ship pull up alongside of us in the dark and unload many boxes she demanded to know if illegal contraband was being delivered
9282756 i told her the boxes only contained eggs which was true we had left vancouver without our egg supply and had to arrange for the emergency delivery at sea whether she believed me is another question
9282757 when passengers ask for their breakfast cereal i try to humor them saying the crew dont milk the cows until 5 p m occasionally someone takes me seriously
9282758 police seized political literature cellphones computers cameras personal diaries and many common household items such as paint rope and roofing nails these items are present in almost any home in south minneapolis and are not evidence of a crime
9282759 seizing boxes of political literature shows the motive of these raids was political sheriff fletcher has staged a publicity stunt violated constitutional rights and misrepresented what was seized during the raids
9282760 how cool would it be to be driving a car powered by carp
9282761 its hard to see a fish wasted when there are people in the world that are starving and could use the food
9282762 itd be great if we could find a market for these fish and that market could fund the whole effort
9282763 i thought he played pretty good in the first half i dont know when he hurt his thumb i dont think he said anything to me
9282764 i just want to set the tone and let the people know what i can do
9282765 tell your husband i could see eliot spitzer paying 5 000 for you
9282766 how are you going to learn when you are sitting
9282767 you learn a lot of different ways but the best way for me to learn is to go out there and experience it for yourself
9282768 were confident we can win with whoever we put back there whoever lines up back there we expect him to win
9282769 its up to me to go out there in practice and prove that im ready for that
9282770 he seems to be able to take the unknown and adjust not letting it fluster him
9282771 he tends to take things in stride which is hard for any of us to do i dont know if ive ever been around a guy thats handled a situation like that better
9282772 flacco learned more in those four quarters than he learned in all the days combined since he got here
9282773 the only way you truly learn is in a game environment
9282774 we gave him the challenge early on in the week that this is what were going to do were going to ride him if they were going to take away eric and he said coach just give me the ball
9282775 to be honest i really didnt i just told myself that i was going to go out there and give my best to my teammates and every time i got the ball i was going to run as hard as i could and as fast as i could
9282776 when he gets his shoulders turned he goes into a different speed
9282777 we had guys there we just didnt make plays we went into the game thinking jarod bryant was going to carry more and they would give the ball to kettani they did a good job of putting white in position
9282778 i just thought his demeanor he got a little bit nonchalant
9282779 for us to get to the next level he has to play consistent the whole game but hell do that
9282780 in the first half we let them get some drives on us and they scored a few points
9282781 in the second half we came out with a different attitude we told ourselves we were not going to let them score this half
9282782 he was hurt and he didnt look like he was able to function with it
9282783 if the guys hurt hes not going to tell anybody hes going to try to stay in the game as long as possible
9282784 made all the right reads and all the right checks
9282785 i thought they just made a change to see what chris could do
9282786 i thought he played pretty good in the first half
9282787 i know he can play better than what he did in the second half
9282788 this election will determine what scottsdale will look like over the next five to 10 years
9282789 i think it would not bode well for our future if we had a majority of the council feeling that all change and all growth is bad
9282790 what we need is a balance with the old and the new theres room in our city for both people come here from all over the world for a lot of different things
9282791 a couple tourists said they didnt feel safe on the streets
9282792 i think to some degree this is an election that deals with whether scottsdale is going to be a progressive community going forward or whether we fall into the trap of nostalgia
9282793 theyre coming for the nightlife and the resorts theyre also coming for the sonoran desert there may have been a time when the vast majority of visitors were coming for the wests most western town feel but i think they are coming for vastly different reasons today they are a different generation
9282794 that was what brought us all here it was the quality of life it was charm it was character
9282795 i never did anything with it just occasionally sleep there i had political campaigns there i hope to get a good price for it
9282796 i think we just found the right person for the right house
9282797 the fact is that hes really busy at his day job and hes really busy with his family
9282798 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9282799 i think there is no other issue in the west valley currently more important than the survival of luke
9282800 a lot of people in the national press are saying oh whats happening in baltimore is a new thing but its not new at all
9282801 keep in mind weve been doing this for 20 years
9282802 it occurred to me that the history of baltimore music doesnt pass down in a way that it might in other places
9282803 this is a subject im really quite involved in and i was happy to present to people and excited for people to react to it was a really good subject to inspire some music
9282804 if id only had posters of bands from the past five years it would have made people angry and it would have been misrepresenting baltimore music
9282805 it was like a good mix tape it would be a mix cd or an ipod shuffle now
9282806 if we did anything special we kept interesting people coming to baltimore
9282807 some of the bands that are playing now were affected by seeing some of the more interesting acts coming through
9282808 a lot of people in the national press are saying oh whats happening in baltimore is a new thing but its not new at all
9282809 keep in mind weve been doing this for 20 years
9282810 it occurred to me that the history of baltimore music doesnt pass down in a way that it might in other places
9282811 this is a subject im really quite involved in and i was happy to present to people and excited for people to react to it was a really good subject to inspire some music
9282812 if id only had posters of bands from the past five years it would have made people angry and it would have been misrepresenting baltimore music
9282813 it was like a good mix tape it would be a mix cd or an ipod shuffle now
9282814 if we did anything special we kept interesting people coming to baltimore
9282815 some of the bands that are playing now were affected by seeing some of the more interesting acts coming through
9282816 its only logical that eventually well migrate toward it we dont need interim supplies now we need a permanent supply
9282817 people explored and utilized the most cost effective sources of water as long as they could
9282818 in california they had the state water project the colorado river sewage water reclaim conservation but once you exhaust all of those things seawater desalting is about the only place you can go
9282819 there are concerns that water may not be available for future development
9282820 could they supply water to arizona the answer to that is very likely yes
9282821 we believe it is feasible the question becomes what about the cost of conveyance could it work for arizona as part of the states overall water portfolio it might have a place
9282822 cap does not need the water today or for a good long while not for 20 years maybe 30
9282823 but the opportunity presented itself and if we dont do it now it could slip away for another 40 years just because we dont need it others could
9282824 water is limited in arizona and its a lot easier to help people find supplies than to fight over supplies
9282825 one of our tactics has been to augment arizonas water supplies if we can help solve a communitys problems we can avoid a conflict in the future
9282826 part of the real cost of desalination means spending the money to properly address the environmental impacts
9282827 its a classic economic issue making sure the full costs are addressed we cant ignore environmental costs
9282828 maybe they thought we called the police and could come looking for us
9282829 there will be more rental availabilities and it will lead to more drophouses because those people renting out their properties are going to be almost as desperate as the people crossing the border
9282830 i never saw the people until i rented to them
9282831 most smugglers are opportunists they see a for rent sign or an advertisement
9282832 ninety percent of the time the owners dont want to rent to coyotes most usually are unaware of whats going on until we go in and kick in the door
9282833 and a funny electricity goes through your body you are holding in your hands something johann sebastian bach held in his
9282834 what philippe has accomplished would not have been possible without the digital age
9282835 i was fascinated by the story of that manuscript and put it in the recesses of my memory
9282836 i noticed that there were a few music manuscripts in the inventory so i wondered where they could be
9282837 a very short piece of information two lines mentioning that in a small museum in a city south of paris called melun there was a sheet of music given by neukomm to a certain auguste vincent
9282838 now i can affirm that the melun manuscript contains the missing pages three and four
9282839 was the privilege the pleasure and above all the responsibility of being its custodian for a while
9282840 i dont know if french law would even permit it
9282841 if i won power ball yeah maybe id negotiate for it but my father used to say 40 percent of something is better than 100 percent of nothing i have 75 percent and for the other 25 percent a digital scan of the pages is more than satisfactory to me
9282842 part of the problem is that people arent coming to us
9282843 in columbia people are very hesitant they think its just them theres an undercurrent of shame about this
9282844 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9282845 i still cant believe it i felt happy and more positive thats why i felt i could fight through
9282846 im not surprised im sure he will be a very good player
9282847 i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9282848 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9282849 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9282850 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9282851 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9282852 im definitely not at my best but i hope to get there
9282853 it amazes me we have roadway package services such as ups that do a better job tracking boxes than the state does at tracking young people
9282854 for some reason the department of juvenile services sees an opportunity for this young man to be able to be in the community in a group foster home
9282855 im still trying to figure out where they see that except to say that im going to place my trust in djs
9282856 they are giving the 5 checks to someone who is purely a friend who they have known for years
9282857 it is only a strategy to help a friend become politically involved
9282858 the precinct committeemen on this mailer are the republicans who support lowering gas prices and support senator mccain senator jon kyl and congressman john shadegg
9282859 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9282860 im looking for long haul when all that immediate help stops
9282861 obviously without havasupai we dont have much of a business
9282862 in arizona theres a glut of livestock out there and because of the economy people arent buying horses
9282863 after a faculty member assigns a research paper i can tell you that a whole new level of instruction starts and the librarian must often start at a basic level helping the student define and focus a topic
9282864 i think many faculty members would be surprised to learn how much instruction we deliver to students one on one at the library reference desk and that it is often more than how to use library resources or track down items in the library
9282865 a great provider of research and dennis is a great example is a person who knows the literature of his or her assigned field and keeps up on whats new
9282866 the liaison librarian is a great teacher and mentor who can put a frustrated student or faculty member at ease is a great listener and never preaches and exercises great patience
9282867 dennis and his colleagues provide students with the skills to be successful in completing research assignments and successful in completing a course of study and graduating
9282868 there is a lot of variety in my research assistance with faculty
9282869 this year two notable areas i have assisted faculty with include researching irish literary figures and identifying resources for the ethics of biotechnology a lot of the research assistance i do with faculty members is often assisting them in tracking down difficult to identify or track down items
9282870 changes in technology have dominated the field of librarianship and we are stilly trying to figure out the implications and what the field will look like in the future
9282871 we are very interested in how the online environment itself is changing how students find interact with and use information online research requires a whole new way of thinking about information and research
9282872 the public expects quick and direct information from the police department about incidents that may affect their neighborhood or commute
9282873 twitter is one service of many that allows us to do that
9282874 public information officers get the information from the officers on the street and we put it out
9282875 we have consumers that will actually call to make sure what the rates are
9282876 as savvy as people are nowadays with their little bit of extra money that 1 percent increase can really make or break a deal
9282877 avondale has played a role in support of the auto mall from the beginning through partnerships in developing the necessary infrastructure and incentives to attract the dealerships
9282878 to take consumers at this time with the economy being tight for everybody and then to add another 1 percent on it i dont think people are going to be real excited about that
9282879 the city of avondale is putting this to a vote of the citizens who will ultimately decide
9282880 if they say its important for us to have more police and fire then i think the auto mall dealerships need to respect that and say ok this is the will of the people this wasnt just done by the city council
9282881 and if the citizens of avondale say no we dont want this then theyve spoken and it doesnt affect the auto mall at all
9282882 not once when i bought a vehicle was the sales incentive hey come to avondale our taxes are lower in fact every time when i bought a vehicle i asked doesnt avondale have a different tax rate the sales person and the sales manager had no idea about it
9282883 first of all i dont really guarantee thats not the business im in but i fully fully fully anticipate kellen being on the roster on opening day unless something earth shattering happens
9282884 for everyone out there that thinks they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9282885 you need to be scared and you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9282886 coming from the national hurricane center this could be as bad as it gets
9282887 we decided to ride it out not this time no way im not making the same mistake again
9282888 i dont care about my stuff i just want to live
9282889 i am traveling from pillow to pillow seeing where well end up tonight
9282890 this is my baby i didnt want to leave him
9282891 it seems to be a bit of ghost town with people fleeing
9282892 i cant promise nothing will happen but there will be a tremendous number of law enforcement here
9282893 we will pretty much be able to lock down the city
9282894 this has to be the biggest surprise in this years presidential campaign drama but its a strategically brilliant development for mccain
9282895 he needed a reformer someone who could be at home on the straight talk express but he also desperately needed to woo evangelical voters no republican has captured the white house in modern history without their support
9282896 is this really who the republican party wants one heartbeat away from the presidency
9282897 given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9282898 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9282899 really has energized the conservative base and is an indication that john mccain is returning to his conservative roots
9282900 i dont know her personally but friends of mine who do say she could turn out to be the american version of conservative former british prime minister maggie thatcher
9282901 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and the country second
9282902 it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling one more time
9282903 he thinks someone like me who is a clinton delegate is going to say oh goody a woman he doesnt understand who we are
9282904 he is balancing his ticket and thats a smart thing
9282905 its going to be good for the republicans and not so good for us
9282906 each party negotiating this has their own views about their own standards being better
9282907 but as long as we can show were not lowering safety and were lowering cost were all interested in that
9282908 it may involve changes to the structure it may involve changes to material but they result in not so many differences in the safety levels of the vehicles
9282909 the skill set you need in terms of the coordination and balance and things like that you cannot choose to drink and ride its just the wrong choice to make
9282910 our vision is really toward zero deaths everyone counts so were not exactly celebrating these numbers
9282911 age 21 drinking laws have been proven time and again effective in preventing deaths and injuries
9282912 police and prosecutors have shared the grief of families but have so often been unable to seek justice for the full offense
9282913 we think there are several types of value to this law
9282914 one is deterrence hopefully people will take this into account when they beat up on a woman
9282915 he had a name he was loved and his life was violently taken from him before he ever saw the sun
9282916 yes we are all the corps and the levee districts better to respond now to breaches and other issues
9282917 weve learned how to close a breach and we have the materials ready to go
9282918 im more comfortable today with the ability of everyone to respond
9282919 during katrina we had no communication with the corps for several days
9282920 but those problems seem to have been eliminated with redundant communications systems
9282921 there is also an unwatering plan that has been revised but id caution everyone to remember that anytime you get water into the heart of the city it takes time to get it out
9282922 when we think they might be dying out or merely surviving they are actually thriving
9282923 they are moving into new states and settling or establishing new settlements in communities where local officials arent acquainted with them
9282924 that creates some misunderstanding on zoning issues or other unique factors in amish practice
9282925 one family doesnt go there is a group of them that goes like two or three or four
9282926 they can continue to let people know were here come visit us how the land is the orchards do great or whatever
9282927 an amish woman said we joke among ourselves if we keep growing at this rate soon half the world will be amish and the other half will be taxi drivers
9282928 several kids and babies died in the fields because parents were fearful of sending them to head start
9282929 since early 2007 many of our programs started to notice that border patrol of immigration and customs enforcement vehicles were parked outside their centers and some were following buses picking up children
9282930 it could have happened if we believe there was an immigration violation afoot but its not our policy or practice i believe
9282931 generally our operations avoid actions at school settings however we will take into custody during these targeted operations anyone encountered who may be in the country illegally
9282932 we ask that ice enforcement and intimidation tactics near migrant and seasonal head start centers cease immediately
9282933 parents were fearful of going to the centers or letting their kids get on the bus and enrollment went down in some parts
9282934 since the head start program was started in 1965 we have never asked families if they are citizens and its never been a requirement
9282935 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9282936 we will try to adapt the convention to the fact we might have a natural disaster going on
9282937 what they dont want is a split screen showing smiling cheering republicans on one side and death and devastation on the other
9282938 i dont know if its practical to cancel or postpone it but they could very well dispense with some of the more festive aspects
9282939 and if your revenues arent covering your costs youve got a problem
9282940 some people just dont like to see a mexican boot shop on main street because it looks like tijuana
9282941 theyre just trying to wave a magic wand but they would be doing nothing to build community its social engineering its a war on the poor i cant find another way to look at it
9282942 the woman touched my breast i said you cant do that
9282943 i said you cant treat me as a criminal for wearing a bra
9282944 they tried to humiliate me and i was not going to be humiliated over this
9282945 am lie a mieux jou que moi aujourdhui elle a su ce quil fallait faire elle a bien tenu son plan bravo elle je mattendais ce que a aille tr s vite peut tre parce que je venais de jouer contre ivanovic mais ce n tait pas le cas c tait m me moi de faire le jeu du coup jai essay de faire le point trop vite et son slice ma beaucoup g n e cest pour a que jai fait pas mal derreurs
9282946 il y a peut tre un coup jouer comme dans tous les derniers grands chelems on a le sentiment quil peut se passer beaucoup de choses
9282947 je suis content de ce qui marrive mais mon objectif ce ne sont pas les huiti mes je suis l pour gagner le tournoi
9282948 etter john mccains utnevnelse av sarah palin som visepresidentkandidat var sv rt positive
9282949 for example if a voter begins on one side of the ballot on the left side then turns the ballot over and votes on the right side then the ballot is spoiled
9282950 we have the partisan ballot and thats the type one ballot and what the races in that ballot are the washington delegate the seats for the 30th guam legislature the mayor and the vice mayor race
9282951 where else do you have such an abundance of land
9282952 samir suleymanov the world banks director for russia asked in an interview sort of blows a big hole in the lack of arable land argument made by the greenies the steppes are twice the size of the us prairie states
9282953 russia is very often perceived throughout the world as a major military power
9282954 at the same time and perhaps above and beyond anything else russia is a major agrarian power
9282955 the great story of this land is how big it is
9282956 you cant buy anything like it anywhere else in the world
9282957 in moscow they said i was crazy for going into agriculture
9282958 we see an increasing number of entrepreneurs coming to us with business plans trying to convert this land
9282959 some will be successful but most will not be able to do it
9282960 in 10 or 15 years russia will be the leading force in world agriculture just because of its mass
9282961 we were able to point out to him that he was going somewhere where people know him
9282962 dan henning being here is big he broke him in maybe that was the biggest thing maybe more so than me he already had a relationship with him has done pretty good
9282963 in this business you never know when what you think is an opportunity is going to come along
9282964 we like chad henne very much and think hes got real good potential weve got two young quarterbacks
9282965 you are breaking my heart that jersey has broken heart written all over it
9282966 ill never watch another packers game without no 4 on the field
9282967 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy thing its like the that old adage a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reason
9282968 the fact is if no one claims them theres nothing you can do with them
9282969 you cant throw them away they could be uncle freddys ashes they could come and sue you
9282970 there needs to be a dignified way to finally put these people to rest and allow the funeral homes to do that under the law
9282971 youll hear people say all the time just cremate me and throw me in the river
9282972 the more the word gets out that cremation is not final disposition that something still needs to be done the better off we will be
9282973 i told her what happened she said ill call you back
9282974 its really weeded out the little guy thats building on a limited budget
9282975 hes not going to be able to afford to stay in the sport
9282976 i get calls every day asking about the price if they dont like mine they go down the road and call the next guy
9282977 for a while more people brought in cars but the regulations are tough
9282978 i just like to see the cars crashing the excitement of whos gonna stop and have to sit there and wait whether theyre gonna get squished or not
9282979 its kill or be killed and you destroy him or he destroys you
9282980 but the things that validate me as a writer arent going to be the money or the number of translations or printed copies
9282981 i always wrote to entertain myself that was always my goal to educate and have fun and to fill my evenings
9282982 it was a lovely lovely place to grow up and there was a premium on education there
9282983 i will say i had an exceptional high school english teacher i had always written but it was in her class that i really came to understand how much i loved both reading and writing
9282984 at the time that i started this i had already been doing research on the treatment of severe burn survivors for no real reason other than i found the medical aspects of it fascinating
9282985 id been carrying around a story idea for many years about how could i start a relationship with that feeling and these things all came together and i thought id take it to the most literal level where theres an actual burn
9282986 youre thinking ok this is the next journey this is the next thing that im going to learn about
9282987 whether i have a publishing deal or dont have a publishing deal my life was going down a good path anyway i was already happy
9282988 in a sentence i can sum it up theyre good people and i was well loved
9282989 and when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me shine on until tomorrow let it be
9282990 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9282991 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9282992 he was down to the point that if the meeting had gone well and it was expected to go well there was going to be an offer
9282993 i dont think he would have invited her if it werent his intention to offer her the job
9282994 we obviously were looking at a lot of different options
9282995 we looked at base options women pro choice pro life people outside the party it was a very broad and deep search most of the people we checked out never made it into the public domain and some speculated on were very very competitive for the job
9282996 its a little naive on the part of the media to assume because they werent reporting this palins consideration for the last few months theres something up on this we didnt spend any time saying yes or no to any of the speculation
9282997 they always say he was a maverick and this made me think well he really is he went all the way to alaska there arent that many people up there they dont have that many electoral votes and he picked this person
9282998 i know people will say shes inexperienced but shes been a governor for 20 months thats more experience than obama has
9282999 i would have thought about voting for mccain but now absolutely not
9283000 during this most recent contest stephanie and i started off on different sides we would see each other and she would say to me this is what it means to be a friend and all i could say is i understand and that is a testimony to her and the kind of person she was
9283001 two leaders came together and they talked and she felt good about the conversation
9283002 theres a 6 year old who looks at me and says are you really the president and i said yes i am and he said youre not dead yet and well you know he thought the president was george washington or thomas jefferson a president was a dead white guy thanks to you senator no one will ever think that is the definition again
9283003 you will see a variety of creative ways of demonstrating and protesting the bush administration and what they have done to this country in the last eight years
9283004 that really was sort of the major major motivation for me to get here somehow
9283005 i wanted to be in proximity of the event just to say that ok i was at least in the city when he gave the speech
9283006 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9283007 it seems to me they have got to separate mccain from bush the democrats did a good job of hanging bush around his neck
9283008 they have to make him look like his own man with a different agenda stuff that plays up his maverick side he has to shake that monkey off his back or he is in trouble
9283009 he will have to talk about its time to pass the torch and understand the future holds different challenges and john mccain will not be his clone figure out some way to say that with glittering generalities
9283010 conventions are about the next president and who the candidates are going to be
9283011 and its their chance to shine and we intend for the spotlight to shine fully on john mccain
9283012 how our nation has faced significant challenges on several different fronts and that john mccain is the type of person who can come in and start leading immediately because hes got the experience to do so
9283013 do not expect the speech to define the presidents legacy
9283014 this is not an opportunity to recap accomplishments over the past seven and a half years it will certainly not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9283015 it is hard to see mccain riding to victory on a positive campaign
9283016 so that leaves reducing obama to rubble by pounding his experience strength and character it will be ugly
9283017 as a senator he has shown his independence of right wing orthodoxy on some very important issues
9283018 but on the two great questions of this election how to rebuild the american dream and how to restore americas leadership in the world he still embraces the extreme philosophy that has defined his party for more than 25 years
9283019 nobody wants to get out and get dirt under their fingernails
9283020 people get sick with diabetes theyre obese and there are heart attacks and stress because we eat an american diet now beans regulate the highs and lows of sugar okra makes you healthy you can eat this food and feel the spirit immediately
9283021 when we lost that water we lost generations of farming
9283022 then people had the attitude like they owe us im going to take these rations so now we have to start over again a little at a time
9283023 deben asustarse deben preocuparse y necesitan salir de nueva orleans ya esta es la tormenta del siglo
9283024 a lot of people in the national press are saying oh whats happening in baltimore is a new thing but its not new at all
9283025 keep in mind weve been doing this for 20 years
9283026 it occurred to me that the history of baltimore music doesnt pass down in a way that it might in other places
9283027 this is a subject im really quite involved in and i was happy to present to people and excited for people to react to it was a really good subject to inspire some music
9283028 if id only had posters of bands from the past five years it would have made people angry and it would have been misrepresenting baltimore music
9283029 it was like a good mix tape it would be a mix cd or an ipod shuffle now
9283030 if we did anything special we kept interesting people coming to baltimore
9283031 some of the bands that are playing now were affected by seeing some of the more interesting acts coming through
9283032 i am pleased that as the bar is being raised our students are continuing to meet the challenges set before them in terms of competing with other students in maryland and the united states
9283033 i am particularly pleased with the results for our african american students we are continuing to enhance opportunities for all of our students and this is an area in which we are clearly beginning to see the fruits of our labor
9283034 sometimes what students need is for somebody to say you can do this
9283035 i think its important for us to look at both ends the under preparedness of students and the lack of resources some of our schools might have
9283036 its not just the children some of it is what we have to do much of it its partly our responsibility to look at our role in supplying the support whether its technology or motivation for students who are not consistently performing to their potential
9283037 its going to give us a much more accurate picture of whats the reality at our schools
9283038 we have to bring some rationality in how we determine school capacity
9283039 this is more like an incremental step in a process thats dragged on were in a situation where you can be on a waiting list for up to six years before you can start a project
9283040 the whole issue of changing the formula became a political hot potato
9283041 were confident he will do a great job going forward
9283042 our applicants went way up after we announced the program
9283043 i forget when im on campus that im in baltimore
9283044 i was really nervous because i thought i wouldnt understand anything
9283045 i know theyre going to help me out when i need help
9283046 we have great faith in our eighth graders and we are trying to teach them leadership
9283047 some of them really feel like theyre in a leadership position
9283048 the eighth graders are looked on as helpers not someone to fear
9283049 a peach that is quite a sizeable object that explains why my belly is starting to look like an engorged puffer fish i have a peach inside of me peaches are big big and juicy mmmmm crap now i want to eat a peach
9283050 i think what we have been seeing on tv is very similar to what took place on radio during the depression in that both are about reassurance
9283051 just as hearing roosevelts words reassured americans that things were going to get better so does seeing barack obamas nomination this week offer reassurance to many of us that the best hopes and aspirations of the 1960s have not been lost what we have been seeing the past weeks reassures us that america has not been hopelessly diminished
9283052 let us keep the promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9283053 there is such ebullience from the audience in those closed arenas that its contagious this goes for republicans and democrats
9283054 i cannot understand how this text was not passed to a literate native speaker or to any spanish teacher for suggestions and corrections
9283055 they should have been taken down a while ago not all branches got the correct message to take the signs down
9283056 we picked him because he doesnt have an apple head or bug eyes
9283057 we didnt want him to be a lap dog that doesnt do anything
9283058 i think what we have been seeing on tv is very similar to what took place on radio during the depression in that both are about reassurance
9283059 just as hearing roosevelts words reassured americans that things were going to get better so does seeing barack obamas nomination this week offer reassurance to many of us that the best hopes and aspirations of the 1960s have not been lost what we have been seeing the past weeks reassures us that america has not been hopelessly diminished
9283060 let us keep the promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9283061 there is such ebullience from the audience in those closed arenas that its contagious this goes for republicans and democrats
9283062 you thought it would be a great goldmine of votes to go to
9283063 i cant figure out how mortgages ltd decided to fund the condo projects it did when it did
9283064 i think weve all seen dogs that are really slow to move and often what happens is people say the dogs getting old
9283065 when you think about the muscle atrophy or wasted older dog thats progression some of those dogs end up euthanized
9283066 he stays at my home with me i think if he wasnt with me every day like that we wouldnt have picked up on the injury
9283067 we knew something was wrong we just werent sure what it was
9283068 he basically got the same workup that a person would have
9283069 they need to perform certain tasks and if theyre not 100 percent its hard for them to do that
9283070 with working dogs its real hard to tell when theyre in pain
9283071 it wasnt even a question of doing the right thing
9283072 we have become accustomed to our students scoring above state and national levels but that does not mean we become complacent
9283073 even though our scores are 38 to 50 points higher than the national scores what is most impressive is we continue to see our scores increase
9283074 nie dyskutuj z g upcem ludzie mog nie dostrzec r nicy

9283077 americas lead over its economic rivals has been entirely forfeited
9283078 he was a very modest shy gay man and he wrote with enormous sensitivity
9283079 one of the brilliant stable of playwrights developed by producer fred coe one that included paddy chayefsky bob aurthur horton foote and j p miller
9283080 the only answer is to make believe you never heard of it and plunge back into your work
9283081 admiringly suited to the intimacy of tvs live closet drama almost all of his plays are concerned with family relationships
9283082 you will never hear me say it wasnt a golden era it was as golden as golden can be not a zenith but a flowering period it offered tremendous opportunity to young talent
9283083 i fell in love with the theater when i was 14 and saw katharine cornell in st
9283084 he recalled in a 1981 interview with the associated press
9283085 thirty years later when somebody asked me to write her biography i felt i was paying my debt
9283086 discrimination in voting today is more subtle than the visible methods used in 1965 however the effects and results are the same
9283087 an opportunity to take a more serious look at how it can fix its voting laws to better protect minority voting rights
9283088 do you think its possible your child could grow up to be president or not
9283089 were going to go back to mississippi and get called racial epithets again this isnt going to change anything
9283090 fights to preserve a lifestyle quickly disappearing from rural america
9283091 he wanted to tie the whole political legacy together by doing a documentary about me
9283092 i fought it but when i found out he had cancer and i saw that it was important to him we started working in it
9283093 in the u n system when people see some trouble in africa
9283094 my grandparents lived in west louisbourg so i have a deep love of the place
9283095 beyond the fog covers the people who were living in fort louisbourg in 1928
9283096 to my knowledge this is the first time the history of this time in the history of the greater picture of louisbourg has been documented it covers the time of settlement after 1758 until 1968
9283097 recording the lives of those who came before us creates a legacy for those to come
9283098 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished
9283099 i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america
9283100 so if he were to pick governor kaine it would be an intensely political choice where he said you know what im really not first and foremost concerned with is this person capable of being president of the united states
9283101 den irakiske tolk som kom til danmark med sine to koner har nu valgt at forlade danmark igen tolken n gtede at lade sig skille frivilligt fra den ene af sine koner sagen om opl sning af det ene af gteskaberne forts tter ved landsretten selvom tolken er rejst det b r den ogs g re det er i orden med mig at vi f r sl et fast med 7 tommers s m at bigami er ulovligt

9283103 my phone has been ringing off the wall with people saying they want to help
9283104 there are professional carpenters who said theyd help head this up and theres other volunteers saying they can use a hammer or haul lumber
9283105 its really great it shows community spirit when things like this happen
9283106 were going to try to get where they scallop draggers towed and got lobsters
9283107 we had reports of scallop boats that got 80 to as high as 240 lobsters to a tow
9283108 theres been no storms so if we can catch damaged lobster how are they scallop draggers going to be able to blame it on the storm this year
9283109 were doing this for all the communities around here because everybody knows when lobster fishing is gone this place is going to be a ghost town
9283110 there are some 10 or 12 year old milkers but just a few
9283111 a pitch black sleek hairy and approximately eight and a half foot sasquatch
9283112 we own hunting and fishing camps and in the last 22 years we have brought in and weighed over 150 bears and i have seen 15 or 16 live ones five this spring so i know a bear when i see one
9283113 crossed the road in three or four long steps swinging its long arms like a human
9283114 i know what we saw and i dont care if people believe us or not there are four of us who witnessed the same thing so why would we just make up something like that up
9283115 youre trying to win a championship and ive always said in the course of winning a championship there will be some damage to some folks in order to do that thats the sacrifice thats the cost thats the price of a championship somebody has to do something that theyve never done before somebody has to play more games do more than theyve done before thats the price that you pay
9283116 the republican party is like a subsidiary of the bush family the two are so tied together now
9283117 mccain is going about this in a very respectful manner and trying to tread a line with the president
9283118 i mean i think theres a period in the u s history where bushes have been in the forefront and this happens to be one of them
9283119 i really hope some of my grandkids will be actively involved in politics
9283120 i think jeb might try to make a hit with the political stage again
9283121 he was a self admitted workaholic and really needed a break
9283122 and he also had to face the reality that the bush name for political purposes had been seriously damaged by his brother
9283123 this is not a family that sits around the table and says you run for this office or that office they dont have those conversations
9283124 there is an unspoken code that you find a way to give back to the community
9283125 sometimes it seems like the really important things are left to me
9283126 early on she seemed as many of us would not quite comfortable in the speaker role
9283127 i know more about each one of these issues than i did eight years ago when we moved from texas to the white house and i also realized it took me a long time ill have to admit it over the eight years that i do have a podium because my husband is president
9283128 there is a part of every texas woman that is pretty tough
9283129 we have only seen glimpses of laura bush and i think thats been purposeful on her part
9283130 thats not the big news the big news is that older americans are using the internet for new and pretty meaty tasks that they previously werent doing
9283131 without knowing how to use a cell phone and use a computer and knowing how to type you were kind of like an old soul instead of a young soul in modern america
9283132 theres such a level of apprehension whenever youre new to something
9283133 everybody else takes golf lessons and tennis lessons im going to take computer lessons
9283134 i can see all the world on my computer i e mail with friends in chicago i send letters to belarus and moscow and minsk all over
9283135 i asked my daughter who is 17 do you ever meet anybody new on facebook
9283136 but for the boomer group its all about meeting new people its exactly the opposite
9283137 kids even when theyre sick are resilient theyre upbeat and hopeful and we wanted to give them that kind of environment
9283138 now that theyve emptied the garage im worried theyll move on to the house
9283139 we know theres people watching waiting for something to be left out
9283140 as long as there are a large number of people addicted to narcotics that live on this island well always have a problem with theft
9283141 you would expect that youd be able to put a potted plant on your porch but thats not the case
9283142 some people stealing is part of their culture and part of their life
9283143 to them its a 24 hour a day job if they want it bad enough theyre going to get it you have to remain vigilant against that
9283144 we will use it primarily for catastrophic storms as a way to safely evacuate in phases to get the galveston county population ahead of the regional population
9283145 at least we know weve got something and thats better than nothing when it comes to an orderly evacuation of the region
9283146 if some decide they cant live without air conditioning and theyre not in the danger zone and dont want to take a chance we have no control over that
9283147 people were more nervous than they had ever been for a hurricane when they saw the same storm on the same track over the course of five days anxiety levels were very high
9283148 i was very lucky i had stayed in cuba long enough to have childhood memories but i left before i could be drafted into castros obligatory military service and i came to this country at an age when i could adapt to american life
9283149 it would be a couple of years before i felt like i fit in and i wasnt a complete outcast at school by my senior year i felt like i belonged
9283150 at that point it was all hands on deck to make it in america
9283151 because my parents had lost their country their heritage and their language i from age 19 would parent them in america
9283152 in this strange and wonderful new country i knew the ropes and they didnt
9283153 come on pop suck it up you can do it
9283154 ive been mayor for 10 years and we havent seen anything like this
9283155 its dirty politics they dont care about the people and all they care about is their interests
9283156 the government must decide such creation of a fleet is in the national interest and unless this decision is made we will not have a merchant marine
9283157 have effectively ended a 10 year boom in the industry
9283158 qualities of good bedside nurse with particular skill in care of the child
9283159 none of us can be satisfied that we know it all this is only the beginning of your learning as nurses
9283160 the tank is a very essential element to the canadian land forces
9283161 and its acquisition will enable the forces to strengthen their fighting capabilities and increase their contribution to nato
9283162 it is indeed a pleasure to see the efforts of the battalion in obtaining a crest to have finally reached reality
9283163 a very large and gracious older home with magnificent view of bedford basin
9283164 uptown country rock and honky tonk with a bit of swing
9283165 we gained a lot of confidence with our original dance and executed almost everything perfectly today in the free dance our programs are completely different than last year and were executing a lot more difficult skills
9283166 i heard from a friend about a program called teacher next door and decided to look into it
9283167 its similar in concept to some apartment developments that give discounts to police because they want to encourage them to live and be seen in the community
9283168 these homes are in neighborhoods that have some combination of vacancies or low owner occupancy rates they essentially need a boost
9283169 its been cheaper to buy a home than rent an apartment
9283170 its an incentive to live in the city i can see myself staying long term
9283171 i was talking about buying a new car and he said you already have a car
9283172 there were two big holes one in the basement and the other in the living room ceiling
9283173 our situation is a complete reversal of what it was only a few weeks ago
9283174 one donation was for 50 000 and it was made anonymously
9283175 aging animals particularly horses are the most helpless creatures on the planet
9283176 they are a huge and costly responsibility taking care of them is a thankless job this woman needed help
9283177 we just cant forget these animals wild mustangs and domestic horses are an important part of the american heritage
9283178 the interest in gathering and disseminating the information or news conveyed and maintaining the free flow of information
9283179 i collected the stuff and never ever did a page
9283180 its part of my hobby of self expressing through images
9283181 as a dad now theres a lot of satisfaction in passing along memories to the kids
9283182 everything is supposed to happen in a couple of clicks
9283183 i can scrap while im on the road if i want to
9283184 that whole hording mentality which happens in paper is going to happen in digital scrapbooking as well
9283185 theres still definitely something about the tactile nature of having 3 d embellishments and touching ribbon and touching buttons
9283186 im just coming into this camp ready to give whatever ive got and i think all the boys here are doing the same
9283187 you have to give that extra 10 or 20 per cent to get your recognition im just trying to stay positive and keep it going all through camp
9283188 if i just keep giving 110 per cent good things will come even if it takes a week or two months to prove myself its all good in the end
9283189 there might be a little pressure because of that but thats good for me
9283190 i was the teams first pick so i want to show that i deserved that its a challenge and i like that
9283191 i was nervous in my first intrasquad game but when i scored two goals my nerves settled down
9283192 all the guys are coming in strong and theyre all fighting for the same spots
9283193 the coaching staff is expecting a lot from all of us there should be a lot of rookies in position to make the team so it should be pretty competitive
9283194 its a lot easier to adapt to when youre in your second camp
9283195 last year i was just getting used to it but now ive already been through that so it helps a lot
9283196 it is encouraging to know there are spots available im hoping to crack the line up but there are a lot of good guys here so itll be interesting to see what happens
9283197 certainly being associated with the organization makes that a lot more possible there have been conversations for a lot of years about me being part of a performance at a super bowl
9283198 im hoping that this leads definitely to that this whole process is basically you scratch my back ill scratch yours
9283199 we just didnt think to register the bacardi trademark so we lost it
9283200 we had the factory that produced the real bacardi rum but we couldnt keep the name
9283201 when could cuban rum be sold in the united states by what company and under what label

9283203 during a get out the vote drive you dont want to get out the wrong vote
9283204 the web has been hailed for creating new opportunities for political expression but there is this dark underside to it
9283205 yes you can reach everyone but you can track target and profile them as well and none of this is disclosed
9283206 it sounds scarier but its less intrusive than direct mail ever was
9283207 the vets all came back in pretty good shape and the rookies have been good
9283208 we can say already that well have a lot of depth this year weve got a lot of veterans back from last year but weve also got a lot of quality kids here its going to make our decisions tough
9283209 i cannot guarantee right now that they are on the team but they have all impressed us so far
9283210 well those cuts are not easy but we have to reduce our roster and were going to give a chance to the guys who have shown us the most so far to play the exhibition games against halifax
9283211 the start of the season is less than two weeks away so it will all happen pretty fast
9283212 our first two games will be over by the end of the long weekend so i can start making those decisions on tuesday
9283213 the two games against halifax are going to be interesting for our rookies
9283214 nobody was vetted less or more than anyone in the final stages and john had access to all that information and made the decision
9283215 i said to walt this cant be happening because his advance team didnt come to alaska to check her out
9283216 were not a very big state people i talk to would have heard something

9283219 they cant re create the reagan coalition life has changed americas priorities are different
9283220 americans are still small c conservative that may be changing in regard to the republican party
9283221 there was a lot of lip service paid to ronald reagan by the candidates but when you get down to specifics they are tilting away from reagan toward some new mix
9283222 its a very rare leader who can bring together disparate groups when they agree on 70 percent and disagree on 30 percent reagan was able to succeed at that bush has been much more typical more susceptible to these divisions
9283223 people now are looking for reasons to argue rather than reasons to cooperate
9283224 there are big elements still out there waiting for someone to unite them
9283225 people are buying these cars from me and turning around and selling them as if they were flipping real estate
9283226 we can create a model that others can look to
9283227 people get into a frenzy and they just have to buy
9283228 and have access to 85 cent a gallon fuel and not take advantage of it

9283234 im not running for president to be somebody but to do something to do the hard but necessary things not the easy and needless things
9283235 i think what he learned from the 2000 primary was to fight back and not take anything for granted
9283236 thats why when obama said that john would use that obama doesnt look like the other presidents on dollar bills and that he had a funny last name that john didnt let that go unaddressed
9283237 i find myself surprised by some of the tactics that ive seen in the last few weeks
9283238 they dont seem like the tactics of the john mccain i know
9283239 i responded by getting angry on the stump and running negative ads about my opponent that only raised the toxic level of the primary
9283240 we should have refuted the above the radar attacks in our own ads challenged bushs positions and in my speeches stuck to the message of reform and patriotism
9283241 i will not take the low road to the highest office in the land
9283242 i want the presidency in the best way not the worst way
9283243 i think a lot of his actions in 2001 to 2003 when he was actively opposing the president were rooted in south carolina
9283244 he shoved campaign finance down the presidents throat and he opposed the tax cuts
9283245 they needed each other bush needed mccain and his great appeal among moderate voters and mccain needed to show conservatives that he was doing everything to get bush re elected
9283246 i thought he was a lot more naive in 2000 he had kind of a cotton candy and ice cream campaign
9283247 in 2008 he was much more willing to go after his rivals
9283248 hes more experienced he knows when to be hard on the campaign trail and when to be soft and discuss his shortcomings
9283249 theres no hurry anymore when all is said and done

9283251 etfs are limited to the in kind redemption process traditional index funds have an additional technique to aid tax management the latter are able to fund redemptions from the portfolio by selling high cost lots at a loss which can be used to offset future gains in the portfolio

9283253 index funds again including etfs employ an in kind redemption process that contributes to tax efficiency

9283259 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy

9283261 we have 28 scientists from seven countries and five years worth of funding
9283262 the end permian catastrophe is an extreme version of the consequences of global warming
9283263 it reminds us that there are unexpected consequences of co 2 buildup and these can be quite dire indeed
9283264 in the late permian earth itself was the villain but today weve stepped in as the villain
9283265 the end of our careers came prematurely we didnt expect it one day it was there the next day it was gone but these guys are making history right now going forward and carrying the tradition of lincoln football it was a real moving experience for all of us who were there
9283266 this is like an opening night for a show on broadway
9283267 i have a whole lot of pride just seeing it this is fantastic
9283268 if you would have heard the comments around alumni and the people who came out for the first time it was just like a new baby being born
9283269 we talked about it all week about not getting caught up in the emotions
9283270 we prepared them we wore our game uniforms last saturday just so the guys could feel the excitement we knew it would be a nice atmosphere and they did a good job of controlling their emotions

9283279 as recently as three years ago people thought we had a natural gas shortage in this country and that we were perilously close to being in a situation where we were going to have to import
9283280 now were trying to figure out what to do with all this
9283281 the auto companies also did a lousy job marketing them
9283282 they thought these things were going to sell themselves federal fleets state fleets municipal fleets are going to have to buy them
9283283 they got a bad rap a few weeks ago that they didnt really deserve and im glad to get this one for them

9283291 michael moore showed us once again how the left has hijacked a natural disaster and turned it into a political football
9283292 abraham believed god and it was counted to him as righteousness
9283293 why would god temporarily punish believers at the judgment seat what good would it do it will then be too late for repentance and reformation all judgment upon believers is for repentance and reformation therefore the view that god will punish unfaithful believers at the judgment seat of christ and during the millennium must be wrong since there would be no reason left at these times for such punishment
9283294 the modern humanitarian spirit tends to exalt the reformatory and preventive ends of punishment at the expense of the retributive that every effort should be put forth for the reformation of the criminal which the case admits of we cordially allow but the danger is in these matters that sentiment degenerate into sentimentalism crime deserves punishment and on that ground alone were there no other ought to receive it no theory can be satisfactory which loses sight of retribution and makes reformation and prevention the all in all
9283295 whats done is done what good would it do the criminal to punish him her now
9283296 the real reason underlying the refusal of some dear children of god to accept belief in the punishment of unfruitful believers not eternal but during the millennial reign of christ is an inadequate sense of the justice of god acceptance of the belief in the temporary punishment of such christians during the millennial reign safeguards the eternal merits of christs atonement on the cross and at the same time preserves the absolute justice of god
9283297 the coming millennial day of justice dominated by the judgment seat has for its essential characteristic the recoil of works in judicial retribution for he that doeth wrong the context is addressed solely to believers col 3 25
9283298 what good would such an extended stay in prison do for the rapist or murderer we cannot undo the crime let us therefore concentrate on helping the criminal

9283354 we would not object to the odd appointment to fill unexpected vacancies if we were consulted but to appoint 52 board members for the entire country for three years is an abuse of power
9283355 these appointments are particularly provocative when national has announced policy that promotes shifting the focus of board appointments to greater involvement of outdoor recreationalists

9283385 los mapas b sicos que podemos encontrar en sitios web como google le dijo a la bbc mary spence son demasiado esquem ticos y no tienen mucha utilidad
9283386 ciertamente nos sirven para llegar a un lugar pero creo que los mapas b sicos deben ser trazados con est ndares m s altos
9283387 existe un verdadero peligro de perder lo que hace que un mapa sea singular es decir la sensaci n de podernos ubicar en un lugar a n cuando nunca hayamos estado all

9283400 nach dem prinzip rollierender blasen f hrt der crash in einem bereich zu berinvestments in augenscheinlich sichere anlageformen die in der vergangenheit schon hohe und stetige wertsteigerungen erlebt haben
9283401 sie entstehen immer dann wenn sich der marktpreis einer ware befl gelt von berzogenen gewinnerwartungen weit vom fundamentalen wert dieser ware entfernt
9283402 das passiert blicherweise bei g tern deren angebot sich nicht beliebig ausweiten l sst
9283403 dass die internet und h userblase innerhalb von nur zehn jahren entstanden sind ist in meinen augen erst der anfang
9283404 es wird und muss viele weitere solcher booms geben denn ohne sie kann die wirtschaft der vereinigten staaten nicht l nger funktionieren
9283405 gleichzeitig brauchen die volkswirtschaften wegen der konjunkturabk hlung weniger geld als bisher um die realwirtschaft in gang zu halten
9283406 dadurch bleibt unterm strich hnlich viel geld f r investitionen brig wie vor der finanzkrise
9283407 wahrscheinlich ist noch genug liquidit t in umlauf um eine neue blase zu finanzieren
9283408 in den vergangenen jahren haben etwa versicherungen j hrliche renditen von f nf prozent erzielt
9283409 noch ist nicht offensichtlich wo die investoren als n chstes hinziehen werden
9283410 in den vergangenen jahren sind viele neue finanzderivate auf den markt gekommen
9283411 mit denen kann fast jeder privatanleger in bereiche investieren die vorher nur institutionellen investoren offenstanden
9283412 nach dem zusammenbruch dieses markts sitzt dort nun eine menge arbeitsloser
9283413 die arbeitgeber k nnen aber nicht einfach alle entlassen daher fragen sie sich was machen wir mit denen die l sung hei t neue derivate zu entwickeln
9283414 das marktsegment muss gro genug sein um mehrere hundert milliarden kapital aufnehmen zu k nnen
9283415 zweitens sollte der jeweilige markt zu beginn g nstig bewertet sein drittens m ssen sich institu tionelle investoren engagieren und viertens sollte es ausreichend produkte geben die privatanlegern leichten zugang zum jeweiligen marktsegment bieten

9283460 ini ada 10 000 hadits kau hafalkan dulu kalau sudah hafal baru bisa jadi muridku

9283462 itu 10 000 hadits adalah hadits palsu bukan hadits yang shahih bukan pula hadits hasan bukan pula hadits dhaif derajatnya tettapi itu adalah hadits palsu
9283463 kalau aku meriwayatkan hadits aku tidak pernah gemetar kecuali jika ada bocah ini
9283464 kalau ia ada disini aku gemetar karena ia lebih tinggi hafalannya dariku
9283465 wahai imam kenapa tidak kau jawab mereka yang memfitnahmu dengan fatwa fatwamu
9283466 aku teringat hadits rasul saw akan kalian lihat hal hal yang tidak kalian sukai berupa fitnah dan permasalahan maka bersabarlah kalian sampai kalian berjumpa dengan aku di telaga haud
9283467 jika aku wafat aku menyimpan 3 helai rambut rasulullah saw letakkan 1 helai rambut dibibirku yang 2 helai taruh di kedua mataku dan makamkan aku dengan itu
9283468 kau mau tanya soal hadits atau soal hukum kalau bicara hukum aku jawab langsung kalau tanya soal hadits tunggu dulu

9283474 ia mengadu kepadaku bahwa ia mengamuk karena terlalu banyak disuruh bekerja dan sedikit diberi makan
9283475 semua musibah asalkan kau baik dan sehat wal afiah semua musibah adalah kecil di hadapanku ya rasulullah

9283477 demi allah kalau seandainya aku harus wafat dan selesai seluruh permasalahanku ini aku dibunuh dan dikuliti itu jauh lebih kupilih dari sebutir duri menusuk kaki rasulullah saw
9283478 kelak di akhir zaman akan muncul dajjal yang akan terus menyerang semua pihak dan semua tempat sampai ia di madinah al munawwah dan dajjal tidak bisa masuk ke madinah al munawwarah

9283493 orang yang mempunyai kecintaan cintanya pada allah dan rasul lebih dari segala galanya kalau ia sudah memiliki ini ia akan merasakan kelezatan iman
9283494 barangsiapa yang berniat berbuat baik allah tuliskan satu pahalanya ia sudah melakukan satu pahala jika ia sudah memperbuatnya kalikan 10 kali hingga 700 kali lipat
9283495 ya rasulullah seseorang kelompok mencintai orang lainnya tapi tidak bisa menyusul dengan hebatnya ibadah mereka tidak mampu seperti mereka cuma cinta kepada mereka
9283496 ya aisyah allah itu lebih senang kasih sayang dalam segala hal
9283497 aku sudah jawab waalaik juga untuk kalian kalian mendoakan kebaikan balik kepada kalian kalian mendoakan kejahatan balik kepada kalian sendiri
9283498 aku mendengar nabi saw bercerita bahwa ada nabi dari diantara para nabi ketika ia di dalam peperangan ia diserang sampai luka wajahnya

9283500 kalau ada setetes darahku yang jatuh ke bumi allah akan melimpahkan bala pada mereka

9283504 ya rasulullah kami tau kalau menolong orang yang didholomi kalau menolong orang yang dholim apa maksudnya ya rasulullah ia sudah dholim lalu kami tolong dia
9283505 selamatkan orang orang yang dholim agar jangan lagi berbuat dholim tuntun mereka pada kemuliaan tuntun mereka kepada kesucian hidup tuntun mereka kepada kelembutan allah swt selamatkan mereka orang orang yang dholim dan orang orang yang didholimi

9283514 if hed have redshirted last year no way hed look like he does right now thats a benefit of building our team
9283515 he had two touchdowns and he also caught some passes out of the backfield which is something we want to get going this year with our tailbacks
9283516 he definitely opened up the passing game and he ran the ball really well i didnt count one time where the first guy who was tackling him brought him down
9283517 ive been telling people theyve got to watch out for me
9283518 a lot of these kids dont have plans to go to college so i want them to see how exciting college can be
9283519 when they see the actual field and get the feel of the turf it gives them an idea of whats possible
9283520 it makes them try to achieve that to get through school and strive to that
9283521 some are really good athletes but theyve got bad social situations
9283522 id just be happy if he gets a college degree

9283552 after the end of the omonia aek game and despite the fact that everything had proceeded smoothly both in the arrival and departure of the supporters and while people were celebrating the victory of their team shortly after the end of the red star belgrade apoel match some other people perhaps incited by their own reasons chose to blacken the victory of their team

9283763 a great deal of tonight s credit has to go to mcneese state they played better than us in a lot of phases the only phase they didn t play as well in was with brandon tate brandon had a phenomenal game he played extraordinarily well on offense he played extremely well on special teams we talked about it going into the season he is a special guy the chicago bears have devin hester and every time he touches the field he has a chance to change the complexion of a ballgame we ve talked to our team when he walks on that field we need to do everything we can to give him a chance to be as successful as possible we ve clearly got to play better we didn t accomplish very much offensively or defensively we didn t establish anything we have been slightly hardheaded in retrospect some of the big plays we got in the passing game were things that were there and they were there because of the nature of which they were playing defense they were playing a lot of eight man fronts trying to give you bad plays in the running game and they succeeded we kept trying to be hardheaded in establishing the run and trying to get some momentum in the beginning of the season certainly it s a coach s responsibility it s my responsibility as a head coach to make sure we execute and we play better we were very fortunate i told our players a couple of weeks ago it s the media s job it s the alumni s job and it s the fans job to deal with predictions and expectations it s the coaches job and the players job to deal with reality you have to look yourself in the mirror tonight and find out what it s going to take to play much better next week
9283764 the toughest thing was not really knowing the first 30 45 minutes how long the delay was going to be we took it like it was a halftime we tried to make some adjustments then we found out it was going to be extensive and exhaustive so we told them to just go to their locker sit down put their ipods back on and pretend like it s pregame it s no excuse because both teams had to deal with it to say that we came out flat after being up 14 0 would be a little bit of a cop out because they had to do the same thing
9283765 we wanted so much to establish the running game let s try to be balanced let s try not to go out there and throw the ball all the time even if they are in some eight man fronts they gave us enough bad plays that it put us behind schedule they played well some of the plays that we did in the second half when we started throwing the ball better and it opened the running game i think shaun draughn certainly benefited from the fact that we started completing the ball on the perimeter
9283766 i think he came out of the game totally healthy he made some big throws down the field the play that he made to hakeem that set up the touchdown that was a gigantic throw it was probably as good a deep throw as he s had in the two years i ve been here i think he was probably a little nervous today he made have put a little undue pressure on himself

9283794 se trata de una manifiesta manipulaci n de los tribunales lo cual debe ser causa de aflicci n para el pa s porque se trata de una acci n temeraria en contra de una figura que tiene una relevancia mundial y no tiene otro calificativo m s que de una barbarie
9283795 y podr amos ver un alud de nieve gigantesco en contra de los autores de la barbarie
9283796 porque ante estas situaciones debemos ser solidarios sobre todo con figuras como ernesto que han puesto muy en alto el nombre de nicaragua
9283797 imaginate que se trata de un caso por el que el mismo sistema judicial ya lo hab a absuelto y que lo traen a colaci n ahora que el poeta ha sido homenajeado en paraguay es decir todo apunta a una decisi n de orden pol tico
9283798 esto no es m s que una demostraci n de debilidad del gobierno esto se llama miedo porque saben el peso que tiene la voz de ernesto cardenal y por eso vamos a denunciar este atropello a nivel internacional porque somos solidarios con l y lo advertimos no est solo y un ataque contra ernesto es un ataque contra todos nosotros las y los escritores del pa s

9283915 es war kein ausgesprochen langer weg der vom offiziersheim zum seeamt am hafen hier fehlt ein wort im buch doch er zog sich hin diesmal schaffte ich ihn im handumdrehen jenes wort besch ftige mich wie ein stichwort derma en dass ich ganz verwundert war mich wie nach einem einzigen ruck auf dem hafenkai widerzufinden vor einem portal das man mit wei en geschliffenen steinen verblendet hatte jetzt kommen f nf zeilen einschub bevor die originalpassage zu ende bersetzt wird kommando das war mehr als ein seem nnisches stichwort es war ein zauberwort

9283963 tidak mengapa seseorang mencurahkan air ke atas kapalanya ketika puasa disebabkan panas atau dahaga kerana diriwayatkan oleh sebahagian sahabah bahawa mereka melihat rasulullah di al arj nama tempat mencurahkan air ke atas kepala baginda ketika baginda berpuasa disebabkan dahaga atau panas

9283966 engkau tidak akan dapati sesuatu kaum yang beriman kepada allah dan hari akhirat tergamak berkasih mesra dengan orang orang yang menentang allah dan rasul nya sekalipun orang orang yang menentang itu ialah bapa bapa mereka atau anak anak mereka atau saudara saudara mereka ataupun kaum keluarga mereka mereka yang setia itulah allah telah menetapkan iman dalam jantung hati mereka dan telah menguatkan mereka dengan semangat pertolongan daripadanya dan dia akan memasukkan mereka ke dalam syurga yang mengalir di bawahnya beberapa sungai mereka tetap kekal di dalamnya allah reda kepada mereka dan mereka reda kepada nya merekalah penyokong agama allah ketahuilah sesungguhnya penyokong agama allah itu ialah orang orang yang berjaya
9283967 dan antara tanda tanda kebesaran nya bahawa dia menciptakan untuk kamu wahai kaum lelaki isteri isteri daripada jenis kamu sendiri supaya kamu bermesra dengannya dan dijadikan nya antara kamu suami isteri perasaan kasih sayang dan belas kasihan sesungguhnya yang demikian itu mengandungi keterangan keterangan yang menimbulkan kesedaran bagi orang orang yang berfikir

9284007 clutter is a failure of design not an attribute of information
9284008 tidak mengapa seseorang mencurahkan air ke atas kepalanya ketika puasa disebabkan panas atau dahaga kerana diriwayatkan oleh sebahagian sahabat bahawa mereka melihat rasulullah s a w di al arj nama tempat mencurahkan air ke atas kepala baginda ketika baginda berpuasa disebabkan dahaga atau panas
9284009 barangkali sebab allah menyukai mereka yang bersegera membuka puasa ialah kerana apabila seseorang berbuka puasa sebelum solat membolehkannya menunaikan solat dengan dihadirkan hati juga ia menyanggahi ahli bidaah yang berpendapat wajib melewatkannya
9284010 bahawa rasulullah s a w berbuka puasa dengan beberapa biji rutab sebelum bersolat sekiranya tiada rutab maka dengan beberapa biji tamar dan sekiranya tiada tamar maka baginda minum beberapa teguk air
9284011 hadis ini menjadi dalil disunatkan berbuka puasa dengan rutab sekiranya tiada maka dengan tamar dan sekiranya tiada maka dengan air adapun pendapat yang menyatakan di mekah disunatkan didahulukan air zam zam sebelum tamar atau mencampurkan tamar dengan air zam zam adalah ditolak ini kerana ia menyanggahi sunah adapun nabi telah berpuasa di mekah banyak hari pada tahun pembukaan kota mekah namun tidak pernah diriwayatkan baginda menyalahi adat kebiasaannya mendahulukan tamar sebelum air
9284012 apabila telah dihidangkan makan malam maka mulakanlah ia sebelum kamu menunaikan solat maghrib dan jangan kamu tergopoh gapah ketika makan malam kamu
9284013 apabila dihidangkan makan malam seseorang kamu sedangkan solat jamaah telah didirikan maka mulailah dengan makan malam janganlah dia tergopoh gapah sehinggalah dia selesa
9284014 hadis tersebut menyatakan hendaklah didahulukan makan malam sebelum solat maghrib namun ia juga dipraktikkan juga pada solat solat yang lain ini kerana punca arahan ini ialah bimbang hilangnya khusyuk
9284015 ada orang menyangka bahawa mendahulukan makanan sebelum solat adalah bab mendahulukan hak hamba ke atas hak tuhan sebenarnya bukan demikian tetapi ini adalah menjaga hak allah agar makhluk masuk ke dalam ibadahnya dengan penuh tumpuan sesungguhnya makanan mereka para sahabat adalah sedikit dan tidak memutuskan mereka daripada mengikuti solat jemaah
9284016 anak adam itu tidak memenuhi suatu bekas yang lebih buruk daripada perutnya cukuplah bagi anak adam itu beberapa suap yang dapat meluruskan tulang belakangnya memberikan kekuatan kepadanya sekiranya tidak dapat maka satu pertiga untuk makanan satu pertiga untuk minuman dan satu pertiga untuk pernafasan
9284017 sesungguhnya bagi orang berpuasa itu doa yang tidak ditolak ketika dia berbuka
9284018 hadis di atas hanya untuk sesiapa yang telah menunaikan tanggungjawab puasa dengan menjaga lidah hati dan anggota
9284019 adalah rasulullah s a w apabila berbuka baginda bersabda telah hilanglah dahaga telah basahlah peluh hilang kekeringan dan telah tetaplah pahala insya allah
9284020 baginda s a w pernah datang kepada rumah saad bin ubadah dia menghidangkan roti dan minyak baginda pun makan dan bersabda telah berbuka puasa di sisi kamu mereka yang berpuasa telah makan makanan kamu mereka yang baik dan telah berselawat ke atas kamu para malaikat

9284073 it would have been great to have been a lot calmer but you have to grin and bear it and get on with things
9284074 certainly the ideal situation is that you get your squad settled early you work with all the players in the pre season period

9284082 its great to get that first win under our belt
9284083 we still had a lot of mistakes though and we need to improve those for next week
9284084 that tells you right there the kind of work our offensive line has put in the offseason and the kind of work they put in tonight
9284085 our offense is pretty good at smelling the end zone and getting in there
9284086 i thought defensively we gave up too many big plays but the goal line stands i thought those were excellent
9284087 i dont think we really missed any calls in and out with the no huddle
9284088 i felt good with it i think the line felt very good about it as a whole i think we felt good with the no huddle being our first game with it
9284089 were going to play a little more east west game thats just something else to add to the pistol there were some good signs there but well see we could do well
9284090 it was crazy ive been waiting for this a whole year coming off a redshirt
9284091 i came out there and tried to play as hard as i could just wanted to make plays and step up

9284121 too often we are so occupied with the destination we forget the journey
9284122 i shall pass through this life but once any good therefore that i can do or any kindness i can show to any fellow creature let me do it now let me not defer or neglect it for i shall never pass this way again
9284123 the supreme happiness of life is in the conviction that we are loved loved for ourselves or rather loved in spite of ourselves
9284124 flatter me and i may not believe you criticize me and i may not like you ignore me and i may not forgive you encourage me and i will not forget you
9284125 to be nobody but yourself in a world which is doing its best night and day to make you everybody else means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight and never stop fighting

9284128 the o line proved that they can get the job done
9284129 i just ran hard and did the things we do in practice
9284130 weve just got to tackle better we tackled worse as the game went on
9284131 i dont know if we got tired or what happened
9284132 to come out here and perform this poorly it is an emotional drain for us
9284133 you can make 100 excuses but the bottom line is we didnt get it done tonight and they did
9284134 wed be up to our waist in water here and it would be navigable
9284135 you could come out here with boats all the fishermen would be up and down with their fishing gear and pulling in the catch

9284140 to see my parents on the day that the animals left all they could see was everything that weve worked for for 30 years going down the track its also my future going down the track
9284141 we could have held on but we did it for the benefit of the cows we just didnt want to put them through it the cows spent more time dealing with the salt in the water than producing milk
9284142 we managed to unify the railways shortly after federation but its taken us a century to do anything about water and its still extremely difficult because the water in those river systems is over allocated its a 130 allocation and that was in a good year
9284143 so when were facing a really serious water deficit there just isnt any water any more
9284144 we are now looking at a situation where we could either have an aral sea or a series of acid lakes the options we have shrink by the week because theres less water in the system look things are really grim

9284174 the bottom line is that this is a very serious storm

9284195 providing australians stay away from demonstrations our assessment at this stage is that there is no direct or immediate threat to them

9284200 its something more we have to monitor but its immunization been deemed worthwhile
9284201 these little children are quite susceptible to many kinds of diseases and germs
9284202 all the people who come in contact with them and who cant get vaccinated for whatever reason
9284203 these children could be spreaders of flu so immunizing them certainly benefits everybody
9284204 if we are still lacking someones documentation by dec 1 we will give them fair warning
9284205 otherwise they are mandated to receive them or they will be excluded from school
9284206 whenever the state makes regulations and we have to carry them out its always a scramble the first year it comes down
9284207 when they come up with these regulations id hope there was research behind it as to why theyre mandating it
9284208 i dont think theyre just making it up hoping it will prevent more outbreaks
9284209 its extremely cumbersome for schools to track but you do what you have to do
9284210 weve never tested this vaccine on infants we dont know how it will react with other vaccines theyre required to get
9284211 its always been our choice and now its out of our hands we have to do it
9284212 if its a public health thing like rubella or measles yes i get that
9284213 this has nothing to do with kids this is absolutely the drug companies and the state going to bed with each other
9284214 its something more we have to monitor but its immunization been deemed worthwhile

9284233 we hope to receive national coverage and that there will be lots of people there for us to talk to we will be wearing tops with the charities names on and the sheep will probably be leading us in all sorts of directions so people will certainly be able to see them
9284234 as patron of produced in kent and trustee of canterbury cathedral i feel both of these issues have enormous national importance
9284235 this is a unique and i hope effective way to raise the profile of both
9284236 it has taken a lot of planning and it is a privilege that the police have been so good to allow us to do this
9284237 it has to be early on a sunday morning because not many people are up and about then well also have to keep hold of the sheep at all times so they do not become scared and jump into the thames for a swim
9284238 produced in kent aims to encourage people to source food locally as a farmers daughter that is something i feel very strongly about
9284239 as for canterbury cathedral i was not a frequent visitor before because i am roman catholic but as high sheriff i spent a lot of time there for functions and fell in love with it they need 50 million to conserve it and i think it is the responsibility of everybody in the country to help not just the people of kent
9284240 i asked gary because hes a kent boy and is a great promoter of local food so it was very important that he was on board
9284241 viscount linley had lunch with the trustees of the cathedral recently and was very interested and supportive of the campaign and dr starkey lives in kent and has an obvious affection for the cathedral
9284242 there has been changes in funding costs on international markets and in recent times theyve been coming down as well and that does mean that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9284243 and over time there will be no excuse not to further cut rates if funding costs continue to come down
9284244 the other lenders dont need to be magicians they just need to do the right thing and pass on any cut if thats decided by the reserve bank
9284245 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates none at all
9284246 theyve jumped the gun and it does throw down the gauntlet to the other institutions
9284247 we do think its almost certain the reserve bank will be cutting interest rates on tuesday
9284248 other banks will be following suit they wizard have garnered a few headlines but at the end of the day were going to see a lot of other institutions falling in line
9284249 its been long enough already the longer this is prolonged the more problems it will cause for everybody
9284250 even if they cant cook they will be able to provide meals
9284251 but that doesnt mean we wont address the other problems
9284252 this used to be a beautiful school when it was first put together
9284253 i have no problem paying the bills but the market seems to go down endlessly
9284254 sometimes i wish i had looked for a job rather than just retiring
9284255 they cant give gifts to grandchildren they cant jump on a plane and visit their children like they used to
9284256 the less you withdraw from your investments at times like these the better
9284257 with the happening at simon sanchez lockers i dont understand why they are taking that out on us some parents cant even afford to buy clear backpacks
9284258 mesh bags in sunlight or in darker areas you cant really see what a child may be carrying
9284259 and you just never know you never know i think thats the thing that scares me most
9284260 we settled for mesh bags because we thought you could you know see through them just as clear as you could a transparent bag i dont think thats the case
9284261 i dont believe that any child truly intentionally wants to hurt another student or another peer but when you have things like this you set yourself up
9284262 and one fatal mistake or one fit of anger could end in someone getting seriously hurt
9284263 backpacks are not the only way of transporting illegal things into school ive seen it with my own two eyes
9284264 there are other things they bring in there are other weapons all of that they can bring in without using clear backpacks
9284265 will it deter everything of course not but it is a deterrent
9284266 if you have a whole bunch of backpacks that people cant see through you cant see whats in there but if you have clear bags you at least have a general idea of what they may be carrying
9284267 think of the girls you know the ladies every month they have their period and they have all these things and i dont think its appropriate for other men to be digging into females things and finding things that are not meant to be seen

9284340 approximately 50 000 people a year will undergo acl reconstruction the success rate is 90 95 percent that the person will be able to get back to doing what they were doing before they had their injury
9284341 we double them over we place them together so theres actually four strands that go through the knee
9284342 we drill a hole in the tibia we drill a hole into the femur which is in line with where the acl used to be and we pass the graft up through there
9284343 rehab is the most important thing when it comes to an acl reconstruction and so its very important for the patient and the physical therapist to do what needs to be done post surgery to get the best result
9284344 brad being a videographer i think being able to carry all his equipment he should be able to do that in four to six weeks after surgery
9284345 when i look at the indian bowlers performances in recent times i find a huge difference in their consistency and the attitude to make it count whenever they are given the ball the bowling unit has performed like a well oiled machine and the credit for this should go to the bowling coach ventakesh prasad
9284346 i hope the general public has realized the importance of having a bowling coach like venky venkatesh prasad the set patterns with which they attacked sri lanka s top order suggested there was a definite plan in place munaf patel and zaheer khan s who was best of the indian bowlers perseverance down the off stump line with the new ball were rewarded harbhajan singh too struck at crucial junctures to rattle the sri lankas so all in all the bowlers complimented their batsmen fully
9284347 of course every indian fan would have liked to see a 4 1 score line instead of a 3 2 which was achieved in the end by the tourists no doubt it s hard not to be complacent after winning a series
9284348 the best of teams have bitten the dust in similar fashion and the indians can be forgiven for losing the last match as they had already created history by winning a odi series for the first time in sri lanka it all happens in the context of giving a chance to the reserve players
9284349 but the fact remains that the chances of winning are not high when reserves make it to the side and i guess the gains would have been plenty in winning the last match than trying out the reserves

9284359 we used state of the art insar satellite data to constrain the dike source and that allowed us to demonstrate the existence of the slow earthquake motions recorded by the gps stations on kilaueas flank
9284360 these slow earthquakes are an interesting phenomenon that has only been studied within the last decade and were still trying to figure out how they fall into the bigger picture of earthquakes
9284361 theyre definitely a part of the earthquakes cycle and trying to understand how they relate to other earthquakes and how they may be generated and triggered will give us greater insights into how predicable earthquakes are
9284362 obama will appeal to eu heads of states to get more troops for afghanistan
9284363 the ability to reach out not just to government leaders but to the people of our allies
9284364 he will be able to communicate more effectively with the leaders of our allies and the people that this is their fight too i think that level of communication hasnt been forthcoming from president bushs administration they have been preoccupied with iraq which is not a conflict that has a lot of popular support i believe that one of the things he will bring to the challenge of bringing more resources to afghanistan is clarity of where the serious issue is it is along that afghani pakistan border this will be a priority with president obama
9284365 the british have done extraordinarily well both in afghanistan and iraq i have seen them in field i was very impressed by their professionalism as a much smaller force theyre under even greater pressure than the us military
9284366 it is difficult to find albino variety when an albino variety of a tiger was found the officials did a selective breeding and built an albino lineage from it i will also try if i can make a lineage from this animal it will be a great achievement if we get rare genes of this animal in some other animal and can breed it together

9284378 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9284379 and it is warm not something im really used to
9284380 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9284381 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9284382 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me

9284386 but for the rest of us theres still no change
9284387 we plan to start when were going to start and end when were going to end
9284388 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9284389 this is the real deal this is not a test
9284390 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9284391 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9284392 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9284393 considering the lack of real security during the height of the katrina chaos it seems officials are hoping to instill some that the situation here will remain under control
9284394 i dont think the hurricane will break them but i dont want someone breaking in
9284395 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9284396 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9284397 a full throttle head on collision between thin lizzy and t rex
9284398 we really are at peak performance playing live and we tried to capture that vibe in the album i guess were a marmite band you either love us or hate us but you cant ignore us i can handle any reaction you have about us except for indifference
9284399 i was looking at doing the vaseline rats years ago
9284400 i was raised in wednesbury in pre slum clearance housing so it was a pretty rough and tough upbringing
9284401 i didnt have anything to do with church or any form of religion until i became a christian in 1989 prior to that i was heavily involved in a lot of bad stuff and lived the rock and roll lifestyle in all its accesses i always say it was the jews that led me to jesus because i read an article about the jews returning to israel as modern day biblical prophecy happening in our times so i started to read the bible to disprove it as nonsense hence to say i was confronted in scripture by the living god and realised i had to make a choice consequently i got born again i really was catapulted from the dominion of darkness to the kingdom of god so no man had a hand in my conversion it really was all god i think thats stood me in good steed over the years with all the nonsense ive had to deal with from other christians over the years i can never deny the real experience of god coming into my life
9284402 we attended the same school and kinda shared the same gigs and he hung out in the music store i worked in so we sort of orbited each other in the music scene back in the late 70s and both recognised each others potential we eventually got together in a very metal band called arcana in the 80s which evolved through our time living in london into the band a n d paul and i continued to cross paths through various session work we were involved in and after paul got saved i did some guest stuff with a n d and have done bits and pieces in the church with him but only started to really work together as in the old days since paul joined the v rats i needed a world class guitarist in the rats so paul was my first choice a n d is still on the boil and ive been playing bass with paul and dave rowleys temple dogs
9284403 with hush i made the mistake of using everyone from my church who were also involved in the worship team i stupidly thought i was giving the guys an opportunity to stretch their musical abilities and talents however the leader of the church thought otherwise and i was accused of trying to be a rock star and leading the other guys astray i was told the band was not from god and he refused to give the band his blessing but it was still okay for me to lead worship the other guys in hush didnt want to be involved and quickly retreated for fear of the consequences
9284404 funnily enough i found a folder the other day with dozens of letters and requests from all over the world for the track we released it just seemed such a wasted opportunity
9284405 i basically went back to a hired gun in session work and did some stuff with guys from iron maiden judas priest and tygers of pan tang did a major tour of the east coast of the states with them alongside obituary testament and ice t finished off some albums i picked up endorsement deals from spector bass guitars in new york and spent a lot of time over there i was writing and recording new material for myself and wanted an outlet for this so thought id work on the vaseline rats
9284406 saying youre a christian band to the world has the same reaction from non christians as someone saying were an islamic band or a buddhist band people are generally really not interested in religion or politics in music and tend to switch off they are more likely to be influenced by your character and behaviour than your words even non christians know what bad fruit looks like either way i just say blossom where youre planted
9284407 playing live is what we do best were back in los angeles in january intelligent design is getting great reviews and we are looking forward to seeing how the next year pans out we have some stuff lined up with a new endorsement deal with marshall amplification we picked up so were all set to go into places where even angels fear to tread
9284408 canadians should prepare themselves for cases like the listeriosis incident as we continue to deregulate this is the result of a risk based system that puts business in front of health
9284409 processed food will never be a hundred percent safe to eat no mather how many inspectors you put on the production line
9284410 this will be a wake up call for both food manufacturers and inspectors
9284411 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9284412 were keeping a very close eye on what this hurricane is doing
9284413 if it looks like its going to hit we will obviously drastically change our plans
9284414 like all americans our prayers are with those who will be affected by hurricane gustav
9284415 we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9284416 we are in communication with the gulf state governors to make sure the convention is taking all the appropriate steps as the hurricane progresses
9284417 the safety of our affected delegations is our first priority and preparing for gustav comes before anything else
9284418 it would be a disservice to the american people if they cannot see our convention too
9284419 im afraid chris that we may have to look at that situation and well try and monitor it ive been talking to govs jindal barbour of mississippi riley of alabama and crist ive been talking to all of them
9284420 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9284421 ive instructed my senate staff to monitor the situation closely to make sure weve contacted both fema but also private relief organizations just to make sure that whatever happens people are prepared
9284422 obviously were going to be each day seeing what happens and were praying for new orleans but we want to make sure that people are making all the necessary precautions
9284423 this time theyre not taking any chances so say a prayer
9284424 went down there for a week after when the hurricane hit last time
9284425 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9284426 this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day
9284427 we could see flooding even worse than we saw in hurricane katrina
9284428 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9284429 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9284430 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9284431 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9284432 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this
9284433 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9284434 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9284435 its hard to believe its happening again this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9284436 i think this storm will prove to be a worse case scenario for the production region
9284437 ive either been shooting out of the country or just been busy in mumbai its been a really hectic time for me i havent been to my home in for three years
9284438 im going home after three years it feels really good
9284439 we are literally off to a flying start it was amazing to shoot inside a real aircraft we are really excited and raring to go
9284440 thats not the big news the big news is that older americans are using the internet for new and pretty meaty tasks that they previously werent doing
9284441 without knowing how to use a cell phone and use a computer and knowing how to type you were kind of like an old soul instead of a young soul in modern america
9284442 theres such a level of apprehension whenever youre new to something
9284443 everybody else takes golf lessons and tennis lessons im going to take computer lessons
9284444 i can see all the world on my computer i e mail with friends in chicago i send letters to belarus and moscow and minsk all over
9284445 i asked my daughter who is 17 do you ever meet anybody new on facebook
9284446 but for the boomer group its all about meeting new people its exactly the opposite
9284447 he went to london recently to complete the legal formalites he had already got the possession of the flat though his father chandidas a heart patient was undergoing treatment there the two bedroom flat is a 45 minutes drive from central london

9284449 ganguly told me that he needed to burn out a few extra fats well focus more on work out for the next 10 15 days before he joins the bengal boys in the nets
9284450 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9284451 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9284452 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9284453 i usually go to the event on the first day and this year is even more poignant after last years cancellation i am always actively looking for new research or different genetics that could be applied back on farm
9284454 the beef area at the event will be valuable as it allows me to focus on the two main areas of producing both a milk and beef animal
9284455 it is also a good place for members of staff to go and learn there is a lot of information available and every different aspect is covered
9284456 i dont have time to go to other agricultural events and this brings all the news and technology developments to one place
9284457 with it being such a dedicated show i always learn so much but managing time is important to get the most out of the event this year i want to improve ventilation on farm by removing yorkshire boarding and installing fans so i am planning to find out information on the latest ventilation technology
9284458 this has always been the best and main technical event in the dairy industry a great place to catch up with people to see whats going on and you always get something out of it as a student it used to be electric and i now see it as a good barometer of how the industry is doing
9284459 i frequently go with a list of things i wish to focus on and products i am interested in and everyone working on the farm gets to go not only to learn of new products and ideas but also as a social event
9284460 one more thing an issue that will be discussed among some conservative christians is the propriety of electing a woman evangelical christians are overwhelmingly hostile to feminism and so what is with that i have argued before from
9284461 je to viac pe az ako sme dostali po as tvrt ho kvart lu v roku 2007

9284498 the princes will be remembering the princess privately and in their own way
9284499 we must stress that the foster family still remain unaccounted for
9284500 we can confirm that two bodies were recovered from the main part of osbaston house maesbrook
9284501 there are a range of techniques that will help us
9284502 we must stress that the foster family still remain unaccounted for
9284503 its anyones guess but it seems that the people he owed money to are big companies and i cant see them behind something like this
9284504 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9284505 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9284506 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9284507 that is why i will argue that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9284508 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9284509 we should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the g7
9284510 exercise caution avoiding any demonstrations or large gatherings of people
9284511 all the indications from descriptions im getting are that the piers that support the bridge are settling
9284512 cracks dont appear on the superstructure of a pier for no reason the primary reason is usually subsidence an undermining of the foundation
9284513 i will not bow i will not step down and i will not resign despite the pressure mounting on my government
9284514 since the government cannot resolve the problem even the courts cannot resolve the problem the joint session of parliament is the best choice for finding a solution
9284515 so you wanna be just like your old dad huh

9284521 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
9284522 then what are you looking for in a vice president
9284523 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years
9284524 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
9284525 it easier for users to learn about a given place through photos videos and annotations contributed by users around the world
9284526 it is considered the right of iran to pursue a peaceful nuclear program and it is a legitimate right and there is nothing that confirms with convincing evidence and especially for the experts of the international atomic energy agency that the iranian nuclear program is a military program
9284527 israel understands that she is not legitimate and that her existence on the land she was established on is illegitimate and she will store her nuclear weapons and will use american support to impose this existence and to protect it
9284528 as long as the american and israeli threats are increasing against iran and as long as israeli aggression increases against the palestinian people
9284529 arabs know that iran owns the ways and the means to respond in painful ways
9284530 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9284531 i hope all my fellow children who lost limbs can get out of gaza and get artificial limbs
9284532 i hope the entire world follows the example of this group of activists who broke the siege
9284533 its very bad there gaza its like a prison i wish for freedom in palestine
9284534 it is a complete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9284535 in the name of the italian people i feel the duty to apologise and show our pain for what happened many years ago and which affected many of your families
9284536 in this historic document italy apologises for its killing destruction and repression against libyans during the colonial rule
9284537 slandering the syrian leadership and lying before an international tribunal regarding the killing of former lebanese prime minister rafik hariri
9284538 the timing is not good for an agreement at this time
9284539 operation scored ole 10 last schedule the rebelsports ole miss football sec football
9284540 that policy is part of the decisions taken during our recent coordination meeting with the medan mayoralty
9284541 i think if it wasnt london i would definitely say i was done in terms of the olympics the way i feel at the moment a week after beijing i dont feel ready to retire
9284542 at 32 its quite difficult to say that im going to be here for the next four years because i dont know whats going to happen with my body and things like that i would like to play if i can until 2010 and then see how im feeling and make a decision from there
9284543 people have jobs and lives the players have sacrificed quite a lot already but it feels like they want more the flip side is we made a commitment for a year and finished sixth so how much better would we be with a commitment of two or three years
9284544 after finishing sixth i feel hockey is on the up and i would hate to say enoughs enough and the team went on to win things i would be gutted
9284545 he rivera was a good politician in his first four years but in the last three years he became inebriated with his own power he forgot himself
9284546 we will probably have to balance the books but if someone did pop up that striker who is still not dead and buried if something could materialise there then it might be a goer for us
9284547 its hectic it is one of those where it goes crazy for a period of time when you are never off your phone making calls trying to get players in
9284548 sollte die fusion klappen wird dresdner kleinwort massiv redimensioniert und zur ckgestutzt
9284549 wie sie wissen gebieten die gesetze in deutschland dass sobald man ein ergebnis erreicht hat dies mit einer ad hoc mitteilung der ffentlichkeit auch mitgeteilt wird eine solche mitteilung hat es noch nicht gegeben deshalb scheint es auch noch kein ergebnis zu geben
9284550 the loans will be distributed in one to one and a half year
9284551 wie sie wissen gebieten die gesetze in deutschland dass sobald man ein ergebnis erreicht hat dies mit einer adhoc mitteilung der ffentlichkeit auch mitgeteilt wird eine solche mitteilung hat es noch nicht gegeben deshalb scheint es auch noch kein ergebnis zu geben

9284553 muhammad saleh claimed that he was in tanjung karang lampung when the natural disaster happened
9284554 let me tell you the reason i picked joe biden
9284555 number three is somebody who i know in his heart cares about the american people and the american dream and is willing to fight for them as hard as he can and joe biden fit that bill
9284556 what do you think of senator mccains vice presidential choice and how does it change the dynamics of this campaign
9284557 well i dont know governor palin i have not met her before i had a brief conversation with her after she was selected to congratulate her and wish her luck but not too much luck on the campaign trial and she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and a up and coming public servant
9284558 so its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be
9284559 the operation in swat is in high gear but the holy months sanctity requires that people spend it in peace and harmony
9284560 officially it has not been conveyed as yet but if the government has ordered a stop to the operation security forces will act accordingly
9284561 most of my scenes in mukhbiir were with sammir when we started working together i didnt even know who he was he came across as very non filmy later i came to know he was from a business family with no bollywood connections
9284562 im very surprised by sammirs performance i think he has the potential to become a big star i told him if he was part of a film family like ranbir kapoor hed have been launched in style and become a star overnight though ranbirs debut flopped hes being written about everywhere and abhishek bachchan had 17 flops and he still got chance after chance
9284563 i at least got the support of offbeat filmmakers like shyam benegal and govind nihalani for a mainstream commercial actor today the competition is with the star sons who are launched in big lavish films who will take the same risk with an actor who isnt connected to the industry
9284564 because sammir is from outside the film industry he will have to work twice as hard to prove himself but mukhbiir would do it for sammir its a very unusual spy thriller and sammirs sensitive face leaves a lasting impact
9284565 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
9284566 adding them to the endangered species list is the wrong move
9284567 if it is to maintain its jewish and democratic identity
9284568 when you go to buy a car your negotiating position will increase if you have an alternative
9284569 israel has to prepare a unilateral alternative for tactical reasons to say in negotiations with the palestinian authority for the security of israel i dont need an agreement
9284570 if you do not find a solution we will withdraw sure you will fire your qassam rockets but we will find a way of dealing with that
9284571 we might find ourselves in serious syrian israeli negotiations which might bring syria out from under the iranian umbrella and more towards cooperation and engagement
9284572 these new findings have several clinical implications besides the impairment of sexual function in these young men the lack of testosterone during these critical years may lead to diminished bone mass and the lack of development or loss of skeletal muscle in addition these patients may gain more weight and become more insulin resistant
9284573 hurricane gustav is bearing down on the gulf coast a reminder of hurricane katrina in 2005 and the bush administrations poor response the storm was clearly on mccains mind saturday
9284574 there can be no patriotism without permanent opposition and criticism
9284575 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9284576 and were supposed to think mccain has reasserted himself as a maverick because he allowed karl rove to shove this reactionary spear carrier for the religious right down his throat good luck on that one
9284577 think about how the key factor in this decision was not who could defend this country were something dreadful happen to mccain in office but how to tread as much on obamas convention bounce and use womens equality as a wedge issue among democrats because it might secure a few points here or there
9284578 doing a film where i play a rock musician is a dream come true but being on the cover of rolling stone man thats beyond a dream
9284579 as a teenager i used to dream of being in rolling stone now its come true im quite kicked about it were featured because weve made the first film based on rock music from this country also lets not forget shankar ehsaan loy are full on musicians even if me and the rest of the cast are not
9284580 but yes the only indian musician who featured before us on the rolling stone cover was a r rahman so i cant pretend im not kicked
9284581 the response was very encouraging im feeling more confident about the film
9284582 i wont be seeking out roles or creating characters for myself so i could act
9284583 at the moment ive two films to direct voice from the sky and the sequel to don only then will i think of another acting assignment
9284584 so this year i made up my mind to get up early get a good view and watch
9284585 we want people to use the river and have fun doing it
9284586 the best way for them to understand how valuable it is to the area is to get them out on the water with fun activities like this one
9284587 im sort of a lets play by the rules person
9284588 all members of the chamber of commerce shall pay dues and that means no in kind memberships
9284589 we value our relationship with the schools we want to be able to work with them but we have by laws and rules that we have to abide by as well
9284590 they turned down our 300 from a member saying it would create an improper relationship possibly
9284591 we want to give them the money were going to give them the money we just want to work with them properly so no laws are broken
9284592 it shocked us that the chamber would withhold that money that would go to students
9284593 were not going to change anything that we do with the chamber we hope to maintain the same relationship
9284594 we havent had a chance to move forward with that
9284595 its made folks want to clean up their properties and start reinvesting money so they start looking good
9284596 one of the things were trying to do is make grovetown a destination city for people to shop and get the things they need
9284597 in order to do that you have to attract businesses in order to attract businesses you have to have an attractive business environment
9284598 as predicted we thought pacific would be a much better team than they were yesterday
9284599 it really all started with their great jump server svenja engelhardt i think for our team we can use this as training to always talk about comparing great servers to her
9284600 do something with your life dont do this please dont do this
9284601 i know i dont want to be here just looking at it
9284602 some of them are looking at you crazy like they want to rape you
9284603 kids just dont wake up one morning and say gosh i dont think im going to school anymore
9284604 if we allow them to become disconnected early on were going to have a hard time building a meaningful relationship for them that continues through 12 years
9284605 quite frankly were seeing a heck of a lot more truancy cases
9284606 nothing burns my chaps more than to be here at 11 or 12 oclock go to lunch and see some kid riding his bike
9284607 mom were going to try to help him but right now hes teetering on the path of destruction
9284608 the thing about it is we dont have the time or the manpower to stop truancy
9284609 time after time after time again we have these situations where the kids definitely truant but the addresses arent any good
9284610 it causes a huge problem when we try to conduct business such as truancy heaven forbid that something bad happens with the child and you need to contact a family member
9284611 its difficult to find parents and its difficult to get correct addresses on students because the parents wont tell you the correct address the students wont tell you the correct address
9284612 we only have the address we have on record and if thats not correct the parents have to tell us when they move
9284613 our social workers try to deal with truancy at the same time they are trying to provide the typical services a social worker would do
9284614 if we can save them now then hopefully they wont drop out of high school
9284615 thats the biggest thing with a kid is you need an adult with time to listen
9284616 truly a lot of them dont a lot of the time its not the parents fault because theyre working so much trying to make ends meet
9284617 if its not important to the parents its not going to be important to the child
9284618 since no child left behind we have to focus on attendance
9284619 years ago a student could miss 60 days of school and if they passed they passed since no child left behind wasnt in effect those 60 days were just absences
9284620 we may have special education kids who are very fragile who have to be absent
9284621 im thinking it can be much worse but im hoping it will be better
9284622 there would be drug deals going on there would be prostitutes walking up and down
9284623 parents want their kids to be part of the program
9284624 it hurts me because i want him to get a high school diploma
9284625 if we wait on a quorum to revise a letter it may never get approved
9284626 we have statewide reduced our attendance absentee rates in half
9284627 it has to be for a lack of a better term a communitywide villagewide effort to say that this is what is supposed to happen during the day youre supposed to go to get educated so that you have a better quality of life down the road
9284628 all people have to do is call and ask for them
9284629 instead of having one large capital expense we just staggered it out
9284630 i dont want any small vehicles in the landfill anymore
9284631 the notable fuel efficiency of boeings 777 combined with the airplanes extensive range and large cargo capacity is something egyptair values highly in this competitive environment
9284632 as a new member of the star alliance we look forward to increasing our connectivity across the globe and bringing our passengers the utmost in cabin comfort and service with a dynamic new business class layout that will debut on the 777 300er
9284633 wed like to congratulate egyptair on its order and acquisition of boeing 777 300ers and on the airlines induction into the star alliance
9284634 the 777s operational performance with its significant savings in fuel and maintenance costs will have a positive impact on egyptairs growth plans and help the airline achieve greater profitability
9284635 it is unfortunate that when it comes to touring pakistan no team have been more narrow minded than australia who at the same time have showed unconditional love for india and the marketing opportunities it allows they have not toured pakistan since 1998 bombs in jaipur and london carry a more lucrative blast
9284636 the latter might be wiser to avoid sports drinks and energy bars during and for one to three hours following exercise to maximize the positive effects of each exercise dose
9284637 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9284638 this is the real deal this is not a test
9284639 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9284640 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9284641 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9284642 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9284643 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9284644 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9284645 this is the real deal this is not a test
9284646 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9284647 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9284648 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9284649 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented

9284654 folks can come in sample some barbecue and cast a money vote for their favorite cooker
9284655 eddie george would cook up fresh pork roast and folks would buy it and the proceeds would go to united way
9284656 we thought this would be kind of a way for everybody to contribute to united way
9284657 were still in the organizational stages for it but we presented to council a concept to take that year prior to the actual birth date to focus on different parts of aikens community
9284658 focus on the history of aiken how the town got its start the development of the horse industry aiken as a health retreat and the announcement of the savannah river plant back in the 1950s the 1 agreement with president truman and the dupont company to start the facility
9284659 and then over the summer well get the business community business and technology and the innovation here and the hydrogen lab being located here and several other innovated initiates weve seen in aiken
9284660 its going to take involvement by a lot of members of the aiken community
9284661 when i went through the file that we have from the 150th celebration which was in 1985 youre quickly impressed that its an effort that takes involvement by so many people that live in aiken who just care very deeply about aiken to make it successful
9284662 i was raised by a single parent whose vice in life was horror movies
9284663 i hate the new trend in horror the splatter gore
9284664 i like the old school like nightmare on elm street
9284665 i do think im good enough to be your basic paperback writer
9284666 with a good camera system one officer could monitor 10 city blocks
9284667 this would be a small fraction of the price of many of the projects that have been mentioned
9284668 stop picking picking whats happened has happened this is like trying to put toothpaste back in the tube
9284669 if the chairman is not competent burn him at the stake
9284670 there are 400 000 felons arrested in georgia every year

9284677 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9284678 i would like obviously to keep in our thoughts and prayers the people on the gulf coast especially in new orleans that are threatened by this terrible natural disaster of a hurricane
9284679 but for the rest of us theres still no change mccain doesnt get it calling this broken economy strong wants to keep spending ten billion a month in iraq and votes with george bush 90 percent of the time
9284680 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9284681 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9284682 she seems to have a compelling life story obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9284683 can step in and become president and i dont think anybody has any doubt about that
9284684 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9284685 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9284686 we need all parts wed always love to have more men
9284687 some are music teachers church musicians they are people who love to sing

9284714 its a crunch for us and were at the maximum that we can charge
9284715 were not going to buy romaine lettuce or leaf lettuce for a little while
9284716 were going to have to stick to plain old iceberg for a while
9284717 with the turkey ham you put it on a sandwich add more lettuce cheese and tomato to make it a little more edible
9284718 if you have a couple of children you maybe cant afford to have them buy the few times a week they used to
9284719 i have two kids and you double the cost every week now its 3 a day so no way
9284720 were serving things that require a little bit more labor theyre a little bit more costly
9284721 were looking at what type of bread were using and maybe replacing it with something less expensive
9284722 it was a rather small offering there were a few fruits but there wasnt any cheese on it
9284723 they say they would like lobster and shrimp on the menu but unfortunately we cant accommodate them
9284724 i panicked when i realized theyd close after labor day so i started stockpiling extra quarts of it for over the winter
9284725 in some ways only being open at a certain time of the year may make the experience of coming here more special
9284726 most of our help are in high school or college so by the end of august theyre getting ready to head back
9284727 we really have no choice but to close because we just dont have the people to keep the store running
9284728 theres never been a set date that well close one year we closed right on labor day other years weve tried to stay open a few weeks beyond
9284729 as the town thins out it becomes a matter of diminishing returns you may have less people to sell to but the cost of keeping the place running is the same in september and october as it is in july
9284730 but im very big on quality and almost immediately after labor day it gets very quiet on this end of town you end up not having enough people to serve the customers you have
9284731 then at some point you dont have enough customers to make it worthwhile to stay open so we just close
9284732 we have one lady who religiously orders four dozen crumb cakes on labor day
9284733 she said she cant live without them and they freeze great she comes back year after year
9284734 summer isnt something you can put off its fleeting and there are certain aspects of it you have to enjoy while you can thats what i like about coming to the shore
9284735 the shore is an experience a moment a taste and its sad when its over you have to do whatever you can to get by without it until next summer
9284736 i can assure you that the toll increase whatever he comes out with will not be even close to what he proposed before
9284737 if we as a society and as a state agree that we need to fund transportation and we agree that the only real way to do that is by raising the money then we have to decide whats the fairest way
9284738 were going to confront it and make it a priority
9284739 i just hope its not an election year or leading up to an election year gimmick but its true reform
9284740 all she really brings is a bit more support from evangelicals
9284741 i also guess they think palin will bring in some of the disgruntled hillary people
9284742 all she really brings is a bit more support from evangelicals
9284743 i also guess they think palin will bring in some of the disgruntled hillary people

9284749 as governor stood up to the old politics as usual to the special interests to the lobbyists the big oil companies and the good old boy network
9284750 would probably lead to a lengthy occupation with uncertain cost and uncertain consequences
9284751 4 isnt democracy amazing in most societies it would take bloody revolution or at best a sordid palace intrigue for a small town mom to rise to 2 in the country america where commoners can turn into kings it doesnt happen often but still

9284756 which leads to another point the list of posts obama has held are inadequate but worse he hasnt done anything of note in those posts
9284757 it should sum to 10 years of high level i e gubernatorial senatorial or cabinet experience
9284758 some might think that a primary role of a professor would be to educate
9284759 it seems evident that obama has had several concurrent careers
9284760 youre basically saying the only qualification necessary to be president is winning a highly polarized popularity contest in a state
9284761 certainly i was far more familiar with aks senators stevens and murkowski
9284762 palin is already trying to solve the nations problems when shes only a governor
9284763 ains si yo sab a lo que era eso espera que lo d en el colegio la facultad pero no caigo
9284764 tree tunnels are the best thing in his whole life
9284765 the running mate who can best help me shake up washington
9284766 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9284767 shes got the grit integrity good sense and fierce devotion to the common good that is exactly what we need in washington today
9284768 when i found corruption there i fought it hard and brought the offenders to account
9284769 to have been chosen brings a great challenge i know that it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9284770 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america but it turns out the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9284771 we should all be proud of gov sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and sen mccain while their policies would take america in the wrong direction gov palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9284772 ultimately john mccain is at the top of the ticket as i indicated in my speech last night i think that he wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him in in his policies
9284773 but the fact that shes been nominated i think or will soon be nominated i think is one more indicator of this country moving forward
9284774 i congratulate her and look forward to a vigorous debate
9284775 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency gov palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9284776 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9284777 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9284778 some of the equipment of our armed forces have been announced but there are important things hidden whose effect would be shown on the day of any attack
9284779 offensives are part of the strategy of defence and if a country confines itself to its borders it has set a limit and eliminated part of its capability
9284780 all the energy we can possibly ever use for free enough energy if we wanted to draw on it to melt all earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron and still never miss the energy so used all the energy we could ever use forever and forever and forever
9284781 oh hell just about forever till the sun runs down bert
9284782 all right then billions and billions of years twenty billion maybe are you satisfied
9284783 all right but now we can hook up each individual spaceship to the solar station and it can go to pluto and back a million times without ever worrying about fuel you cant do that on coal and uranium ask multivac if you dont believe me
9284784 who says it didnt what i say is that a sun wont last forever thats all im saying were safe for twenty billion years but then what
9284785 youre thinking well switch to another sun when ours is done arent you
9284786 sure you are youre weak on logic thats the trouble with you youre like the guy in the story who was caught in a sudden shower and who ran to a grove of trees and got under one he wasnt worried you see because he figured when one tree got wet through he would just get under another one
9284787 dont shout when the sun is done the other stars will be gone too
9284788 it all had a beginning in the original cosmic explosion whatever that was and itll all have an end when all the stars run down some run down faster than others hell the giants wont last a hundred million years the sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are but just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark entropy has to increase to maximum thats all
9284789 you ask multivac i dare you five dollars says it cant be done
9284790 adell was just drunk enough to try just sober enough to be able to phrase the necessary symbols and operations into a question which in words might have corresponded to this will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age
9284791 i cant help it i feel funny about leaving earth
9284792 we had nothing there well have everything on x 23 you wont be alone you wont be a pioneer there are over a million people on the planet already good lord our great grandchildren will be looking for new worlds because x 23 will be overcrowded
9284793 i tell you its a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing
9284794 i suppose families will be going out to new planets forever the way we are now
9284795 it will all stop someday but not for billions of years many billions even the stars run down you know entropy must increase
9284796 entropy little sweet is just a word which means the amount of running down of the universe everything runs down you know like your little walkie talkie robot remember
9284797 cant you just put in a new power unit like with my robot
9284798 the stars are the power units dear once theyre gone there are no more power units
9284799 dont let them daddy dont let the stars run down
9284800 now now honeys ill ask microvac dont worry hell tell us
9284801 see now the microvac says it will take care of everything when the time comes so dont worry
9284802 and now children its time for bed well be in our new home soon
9284803 are we ridiculous i wonder in being so concerned about the matter
9284804 i think not you know the galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion
9284805 i hesitate to submit a pessimistic report to the galactic council
9284806 i wouldnt consider any other kind of report stir them up a bit weve got to stir them up
9284807 space is infinite a hundred billion galaxies are there for the taking more
9284808 a hundred billion is not infinite and its getting less infinite all the time
9284809 very well immortality exists and we have to take it into account i admit it has its seamy side this immortality the galactic ac has solved many problems for us but in solving the problems of preventing old age and death it has undone all its other solutions
9284810 not yet im by no means old enough how old are you
9284811 im still under two hundred but to get back to my point population doubles every ten years once this galaxy is filled well have another filled in ten years another ten years and well have filled two more another decade four more in a hundred years well have filled a thousand galaxies in a thousand years a million galaxies in ten thousand years the entire known universe then what
9284812 as a side issue theres a problem of transportation i wonder how many sunpower units it will take to move galaxies of individuals from one galaxy to the next
9284813 a very good point already mankind consumes two sunpower units per year
9284814 most of its wasted after all our own galaxy alone pours out a thousand sunpower units a year and we only use two of those
9284815 granted but even with a hundred per cent efficiency we can only stave off the end our energy requirements are going up in geometric progression even faster than our population well run out of energy even sooner than we run out of galaxies a good point a very good point
9284816 well just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas
9284817 there may be some way to reverse entropy we ought to ask the galactic ac
9284818 its something the human race will have to face someday
9284819 oh say i didnt really mean to have you ask that
9284820 we both know entropy cant be reversed you cant turn smoke and ash back into a tree
9284821 we call ours the same all men call their galaxy their galaxy and nothing more why not
9284822 not all galaxies on one particular galaxy the race of man must have originated that makes it different
9284823 is in hyperspace in what form it is there i cannot imagine
9284824 and is one of these stars the original star of man
9284825 mans original star has gone nova it is now a white dwarf
9284826 a new world as in such cases was constructed for their physical bodies in time
9284827 but when all energy is gone our bodies will finally die and you and i with them
9284828 i do not wish it to happen even after billions of years universal ac how may stars be kept from dying
9284829 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
9284830 carefully husbanded as directed by the cosmic ac the energy that is even yet left in all the universe will last for billions of years
9284831 eventually it will all come to an end however it may be husbanded however stretched out the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored entropy must increase to the maximum
9284832 can entropy not be reversed let us ask the cosmic ac
9284833 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
9284834 i will do so i have been doing so for a hundred billion years my predecessors and i have been asked this question many times all the data i have remains insufficient
9284835 when data will be sufficient or is the problem insoluble in all conceivable circumstances
9284836 when will you have enough data to answer the question
9284837 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer
9284838 the stars and galaxies died and snuffed out and space grew black after ten trillion years of running down
9284839 ac is this the end can this chaos not be reversed into the universe once more can that not be done
9284840 there is as yet insufficient data for a meaningful answer

9284870 we have been approached by third parties who are interested in exploring future possibilities for viper as the company evaluates strategic options to maximize core operations and leverage its assets we have agreed to listen to these parties we will do so keeping in mind the best interests of those who have shown tremendous support for the vehicle including employees suppliers dealers and a worldwide group of loyal viper owners and enthusiasts viper is an integral part of this companys heritage while this is a strategic review our intent would be to offer strong operational and financial support during any potential transaction in order to ensure a future for the viper business and perpetuate the legacy of this great vehicle

9284877 when i told people i wanted to be a priest they were shocked and disbelieving some of them thought i should be committed
9284878 now if a youth says he wants to be a priest there is huge discouragement it is seen as a very silly career move
9284879 i was ordained 22 years ago and when i was in the seminary there were a hundred of us just for the dublin diocese
9284880 a woman in the sacristy at a wedding on saturday looked at me and said are you the parish priest
9284881 and its not going to get any easier morale can be low at times you are just working so hard and theres nobody coming behind you
9284882 we have had no candidates for the priesthood for 12 years maybe 15 no intake in that length of time
9284883 way back we had so many priests they were sent on loan to glasgow or england or america
9284884 its the secularisation of ireland the reduction in family size ireland has just caught up with the more secular europe with its more libertarian values good values around freedom and individuality and personal choice
9284885 it really bolsters you buoys you up to see that
9284886 but theres absolutely no need to be they can see it as a sort of competition theyre afraid that if they give people more power theyre going to lose power
9284887 but it isnt like that its a collaborative effort a sharing of responsibility it takes a lot of weight off the priest
9284888 for us to be able to survive we must share the workload said fr mullan
9284889 its quite threatening to the professional identity of the priest when non ordained people come into work in the parish theyre to be paid more than the clergy and perhaps in time their status will be equal to or greater than the clergy
9284890 its up to us to reorganise things and adapt to the change
9284891 we have to recognise whatever god is saying to us about combining the roles of the clergy and the laity
9284892 we have to learn from the missions system the only answer to all this is with lay involvement the co operation of the people is essential
9284893 humanly speaking you might think its going to get worse and worse
9284894 but its gods church and maybe hes putting us to the test to find other ways of stirring people
9284895 the difference in the extraordinary versus ordinary mass is that ordinary means that it is done in the vernacular in our case that is english
9284896 the mass pope benedict authorized done in latin is the same mass that was done in 1962 the last time latin masses were said back then our priests were versed in latin but since the 1960s latin is no longer required in seminaries the important thing is that the mass can not just be recited verbatim it has to be understood
9284897 were getting pretty good feedback and attendance has been steadily increasing
9284898 i think its comforting for some of the older people who remember praying the mass in latin and longed for it for quite a while part of it the congregation is people who are seeing what its like the young people are interested in learning a different form of reverence for the lord and the ceremony of that liturgy
9284899 fr libby came and wanted to start a latin mass and it fit in with us
9284900 a lot are drawn by the meaning of the words

9284918 its stunning that someone with so little national and international experience might be heartbeat away from the presidency
9284919 sen john mccains selection of gov sarah palin as his vice presidential running mate was a stunning decision that should make alaskans proud even while we wonder about the actual merits of the choice alaskans and americans must ask though whether she should become vice president and more importantly be placed first in line to become president in fact as the governor herself acknowledged in her acceptance speech she never set out to be involved in public affairs she has never publicly demonstrated the kind of interest much less expertise in federal issues and foreign affairs that should mark a candidate for the second highest office in the land republicans rightfully have criticized the democratic nominee sen barack obama for his lack of experience but palin is a neophyte in comparison how will republicans reconcile the criticism of obama with the obligatory cheering for palin most people would acknowledge that regardless of her charm and good intentions palin is not ready for the top job mccain seems to have put his political interests ahead of the nations when he created the possibility that she might fill it
9284920 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9284921 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation

9284969 but as for that vp talk all the time ill tell you i still cant answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration we want to make sure that that vp slot would be a fruitful type of position especially for alaskans and for the things that were trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the u s before i can even start addressing that question
9284970 theres a treasure trove of information here some of it benchmarking what weve long believed about the stocker industry and other data offering new perspectives
9284971 all i wanted is to be understood but how can it be possible if people are having a hard time understanding the 1st statement i made
9284972 contentment is not about getting what you want it is about being happy with what you already have
9284973 how can i say i love you when your not even listening
9284974 sometimes being with many people makes me feel more alone
9284975 its funny how people prepare for the future when the future doesnt really exist
9284976 the future has a lot of hope and brightness to it
9284977 we have plenty of late planted corn and soybeans which could be nipped by an early frost
9284978 it is important that dairy producers understand the alternatives and strategies should this occur
9284979 when you are looking at how the cattle grade i think its mostly genetics
9284980 but i also think if you dont feed them right they arent going to grade for you
9284981 hes not using the pain medication hes terrified and confused and is afraid to take anything
9284982 where am i how long have i been here and do i still have a job
9284983 what an idiot hes a dr and doesnt know what a watch is
9284984 several kids and babies died in the fields because parents were fearful of sending them to head start
9284985 since early 2007 many of our programs started to notice that border patrol of immigration and customs enforcement vehicles were parked outside their centers and some were following buses picking up children
9284986 it could have happened if we believe there was an immigration violation afoot but its not our policy or practice i believe
9284987 generally our operations avoid actions at school settings however we will take into custody during these targeted operations anyone encountered who may be in the country illegally
9284988 we ask that ice enforcement and intimidation tactics near migrant and seasonal head start centers cease immediately
9284989 parents were fearful of going to the centers or letting their kids get on the bus and enrollment went down in some parts
9284990 since the head start program was started in 1965 we have never asked families if they are citizens and its never been a requirement
9284991 why would muslims allow them into the mideast as an ally
9284992 russia clearly intended this as a blatant challenge to world order its now up to all of us to roll russian aggression back if they get away with this they will carry on they will also attack other countries in the neighbourhood
9284993 son of man set your face against gog of the land of magog the prince of rosh meshech and tubal and prophesy against him
9284994 were the second largest state in the country were the state with the strongest economy in the country weve been the source of presidents and the source of significant members of the congress i expect us to be treated the way weve always been treated very well
9284995 look at the presidents ratings nationally theyre under 30 percent and at the moment its oh well its the texan you know
9284996 people in our country i think do like to see a new leaf
9284997 i think that people have the image that texas is maybe too big for its britches sometimes
9284998 ive read pundits who say that my being from texas was a deterrent to be considered for vice president but of course id rather be in texas than anywhere
9284999 bush would see vindication of his iraq policy thats what his whole presidency has come down to and if that means showing up on monday and graciously bowing away and letting mccain have his moment if thats going to help him get elected i think bush will do that with no problem
9285000 going into this convention texas role is multifaceted to enthusiastically support our nominee john mccain and to showcase to the country what weve done in texas by electing good conservative leaders who continue to govern by the republican principles they campaigned on
9285001 were such attention getters we might not be front and center like we were at the last two conventions but i think that well still have a prominent role
9285002 its not mandatory but we really love to do it
9285003 no but i can check to see if he is online what do you need him for
9285004 uh its 10pm i am pretty sure they are closed and tomorrow is sunday
9285005 this has to be the biggest surprise in this years presidential campaign drama but its a strategically brilliant development for mccain
9285006 he needed a reformer someone who could be at home on the straight talk express but he also desperately needed to woo evangelical voters no republican has captured the white house in modern history without their support
9285007 is this really who the republican party wants one heartbeat away from the presidency
9285008 given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9285009 sarah palin is the whole package there couldnt be a better vice presidential pick
9285010 really has energized the conservative base and is an indication that john mccain is returning to his conservative roots
9285011 i dont know her personally but friends of mine who do say she could turn out to be the american version of conservative former british prime minister maggie thatcher
9285012 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and the country second
9285013 it turns out that the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling one more time
9285014 he thinks someone like me who is a clinton delegate is going to say oh goody a woman he doesnt understand who we are
9285015 he is balancing his ticket and thats a smart thing
9285016 its going to be good for the republicans and not so good for us
9285017 its to bring the alumni back and make sure people have a moment where they appreciate the institution
9285018 this plane was barely flying with both engines on fire
9285019 the issue now is will texas southern follow its own plan
9285020 i hope it will be better this year but who knows
9285021 that says it all we have been the organization that provided the african american middle class
9285022 hopefully theyll graduate on time and texas southern wont look like the worst school in the state
9285023 he is surrounding himself with people who know what they are doing who have professional integrity
9285024 i found out to my shock that tsu has faculty that are trained in ivy league institutions
9285025 i think our town has gotten to experience things that few other towns in america ever get
9285026 i dont think we will become the hotspot vacation place you have to go visit
9285027 when i come here out of washington d c to a place like crawford texas im reminded of the great values of our beloved texas and the values of faith and family and friendship that you find in places like crawford
9285028 we love to come to crawford we view it as our home
9285029 i think the main thing people in crawford wanted was a grocery store
9285030 then i got a message saying they were all in baghdad
9285031 they came and ate that night but that was one of the great things you never knew what was going to happen i am going to miss all of that the people and the fun
9285032 the thing people in washington didnt understand about this place is that it can be very beautiful and especially in springtime when the wildflowers are blooming
9285033 for some of the other caterers its about the money but for me not seeing these guys here all the time is going to be strange and sad
9285034 its so insidious the way it turns your mind against you
9285035 its the closest i can imagine to hearing voices or being possessed it really does feel alien like something else is at work inside you
9285036 the most tragic consequence is the psychiatric spiral it causes
9285037 we know children of mothers with postpartum depression have more emotional problems as adults for instance they struggle to develop and sustain healthy relationships
9285038 new mothers are very sensitive to the idea they should be good mothers that their maternal function is paramount
9285039 when they perceive theyre failing in that role it creates both shame and a tendency to conceal it
9285040 the goal is to make postpartum depression a more mainstream conversation
9285041 thats the first step in getting women to realize they can do something about the problem
9285042 i would hope anyone who feels the way i did would see a doctor and if the doctor brushes her off she should find another
9285043 no one should have to deal with it themselves no one deserves to feel that way

9285061 i think there will probably a tendency for the democrats to do the same thing
9285062 they will assume that her lack of experience on the national stage will put her at a disadvantage and im not certain that will matter
9285063 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president

9285190 by the end of the weekend i realized how quaint was the mere suggestion that christians of this type should learn to be rational or set aside your religion about such things as the iraq war or other policy matters once youve made a journey like this once youve gone this far you are beyond suggestible its not merely the informational indoctrination the constant belittling of homosexuals and atheists and muslims and pacifists etc that is the issue its that once youve gotten to this place youve left behind the mental process that a person would need to form an independent opinion about such things

9285207 new york citys drinking water continues to meet all federal and state regulations regarding drinking water quality in the watershed and the distribution system
9285208 septic systems are essentially small treatment plants that are essentially unmanaged and therefore tend to fail
9285209 people think that if they take a medication their body absorbs it and it disappears but of course thats not the case
9285210 based on what we now know i would say we find theres little or no risk from pharmaceuticals in the environment to human health
9285211 theres no doubt about it pharmaceuticals are being detected in the environment and there is genuine concern that these compounds in the small concentrations that theyre at could be causing impacts to human health or to aquatic organisms
9285212 it brings a question to peoples minds that if the fish were affected might there be a potential problem for humans
9285213 it could be that the fish are just exquisitely sensitive because of their physiology or something we havent gotten far enough along
9285214 i think its a shame that so much money is going into monitoring to figure out if these things are out there and so little is being spent on human health
9285215 they need to just accept that these things are everywhere every chemical and pharmaceutical could be there its time for the epa to step up to the plate and make a statement about the need to study effects both human and environmental
9285216 we realize that we have a limited amount of data on the concentrations
9285217 were going to be able to learn a lot more
9285218 these are chemicals that are designed to have very specific effects at very low concentrations thats what pharmaceuticals do so when they get out to the environment it should not be a shock to people that they have effects
9285219 we know we are being exposed to other peoples drugs through our drinking water and that cant be good
9285220 the bush administration says that the new law is necessary to protect the country against terrorism but theres nothing in the law that prevents the government from monitoring the communications of innocent americans

9285268 acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is based on a plant stress hormone
9285269 i asked myself could there be other plant stress hormones that have clinical efficacy while various studies have suggested that aspirin can prevent cancer especially colon cancer i realized that there could be a chance to find a potent plant hormone that could fight cancer even better i pinpointed jasmonate
9285270 the jasmonate compound is used widely in agriculture and in cosmetics
9285271 proven to be non toxic it has the same regulatory status as table salt that and the fact we are working on a natural chemical gives us a good starting point for launching a new drug
9285272 has already been shown to have selective anticancer activity in preclinical studies and this finding may stimulate the development of a novel class of small anticancer compounds
9285273 we have clearly shown that berries which contain a variety of anticancer compounds have a genome wide effect on the expression of genes involved in cancer development
9285274 this suggests to us that a mixture of preventative agents which berries provide may more effectively prevent cancer than a single agent that targets only one or a few genes
9285275 freeze drying the berries concentrates these elements about ten times giving us a power pack of chemoprevention agents that can influence the different signaling pathways that are deregulated in cancer
9285276 these changes in gene expression correlated with changes in the tissue that included greater cell proliferation marked inflammation and increased apoptosis
9285277 because both berries and the second agent maintain near normal levels of expression of these 53 genes we believe their early deregulation may be especially important in the development of esophageal cancer
9285278 whats emerging from studies in cancer chemoprevention is that using single compounds alone is not enough
9285279 and berries are not enough we never get 100 percent tumor inhibition with berries so we need to think about another food that we can add to them that will boost the chemopreventive activities of berries alone
9285280 its very difficult to develop a case especially in what we believe is probably going to be a murder case without any physical evidence

9285292 as a result of this action absolute priority is being given to the d a s inquiry

9285325 we are not a party that is prepared to take any risks
9285326 we support the governments nationwide ban on political movements the government can not afford to delay any longer i just want to say we are not a party of delays we have a plan for the future and it does not involve delays

9285334 consumers who want a greener refrigerator should first look for an energy star model
9285335 unlike other product categories there are relatively few refrigerators that qualify for energy star secondly and more importantly to make a real impact they should not keep their old units in the basement or garage since refrigerators run regardless of their contents maintaining a second unit erases any energy savings achieved with the new unit the doe department of energy is running a recycling program www recyclemyoldfridge com to combat this epidemic its important to keep in mind that an energy star refrigerator uses at least 20 less energy than one that is not qualified and uses 40 less energy than refrigerators sold in 2001
9285336 we believe the risk is very very low for the normal population
9285337 this burke flu virus doesnt have a track record of infecting ordinary people

9285340 im nominating for the seat of bennelong because its time

9285343 kevin and i go back a long time i used to change his nappies for him he had the cutest little bottom i can still see those dimples now so i just couldnt refuse him when he asked for my help

9285345 ch teau des dames as recorded in the french history books chenonceau owes a large part of its charm to women it was built in 1513 by katherine bri onnet then made even more attractive by diane de poitiers and catherine de m dicis and saved from the rigours of the french revolution by mrs dupin the lovely surroundings the formal garden and the park surrounding it add to the impression of delicate grace emanating from the castle
9285346 this is regulation gone mad bakery competitions have been a traditional feature of country fairs and agricultural shows for generations and there has never been the slightest evidence that they posed any threat to health already farmers markets and small food producers are under threat by over zealous regulation and this new directive now threatens to undermine fairs and agricultural shows
9285347 this story is a typical euro lie and is completely false there are no eu rules banning the eating of cakes at agricultural shows any rules are only there to cover businesses in fact they specifically protect agricultural cake fairs and other traditional events people producing food occasionally and on a small scale are not covered by the rules
9285348 he is so smart yesterday we gave everyone crayons and paper to color and he colored all over the paper not just in one spot

9285350 could not even hold a simple conversation unless it was carefully scripted by a speech writer it is possible that this is just one of the effects of long term drug abuse it is also possible they are just mediocre anyway we need more research it is however nearly impossible to get close to these people as their political minders shield them from public scrutiny while years of drug abuse lets them believe they are in some way superior to the rest of humanity
9285351 tutal magkatabi ang mga bayan natin sabay na tayo sa biyahe
9285352 gusto kong makita muli ang mga kaibigan ko lalo na yung pinakamatalik kong kaibigang si jonred
9285353 naalala ko nga noong bata pa kami ang liit at ampayat ko noon walang gustong makipaglaro sa akin kasi mukha raw akong lampa si jonred lang ang interesadong makipaglaro sa akin hinatian ako sa teks tapos hayun araw araw kaming naglalaro sa eskuwela
9285354 ah oo mabait talaga siya minsan nga tinutukso siyang bakla ng mga siga sa eskuwela eh kawawa naman kaya ipinagtanggol ko sabi naman niya hindi siya bakla kaya wala silang karapatang sumbatan ang tao
9285355 eh paano kung bakla nga si jonred ipagtatanggol mo ba
9285356 siyanga pala maaari ko bang malaman ang cell phone number mo
9285357 ayaw ba nilang makipagkaibigan ayaw nilang makipag peace birthday ni dingdong august 2 at si marian august 12 ano ba yan dong ang layo ng august 27 para mag celebrate puwede naman 14 15 16 17 bakit tumapat sa playdate nina richard at kc tapos free concert pa puwede namang weekend dahil araneta yun sinadya talagang araw ng showing hindi ko maintindihan
9285358 anong nangyayari giyera ito nagpo promote sina richard at kc may nagpo promote naman na kasabay doon ang reason wala nang playdate sa araneta puwede naman sila umiwas lalot may pinirmahan ang star cinema sa gma puwede namang hayaan muna ang mga bata huwag sumawsaw sa playdate
9285359 sana makarma ang may kagagawan nito ibang magalit ang mga bisaya may devil diyan sa gma na isa alam ko yang babaeng yan na executive ang may kagagawan yan ang inggitera at kontrabida marami na ang nagagalit diyan
9285360 lets celebrate the birthday concert of dingdong and marian was originally set for august 29 and 30 but the big dome was not available on said dates we didnt look for another venue because gma 7 has an existing agreement with the araneta group
9285361 this report is nothing but an attack on democracy they should be ashamed of themselves i am not embarrassed at all
9285362 we cannot be held responsible if opposition members are depressed
9285363 we try to treat them humanely and not ridicule their stupidity but we cannot be held accountable for their political in fighting we have adequate medical facilities and they are not barred from seeking help
9285364 we believe this collective depression syndrome may be attributable to the fact that opposition members live day in day out with agonising uncertainty an uncertainty about the next election uncertainty about leadership uncertainty about policy
9285365 they are just not used to being given so much attention it goes to their heads
9285366 there have been a few incidents these are being investigated but it would be incorrect to refer to them as political suicides
9285367 these people have been held in opposition for years with no chance of freedom criminals are treated better
9285368 it is not for the un to interfere in australias media policy unless it breaches un conventions to which it is a signatory
9285369 we have a gun control policy but cannot stop anyone from shooting themselves in both feet
9285370 these findings emphasize that patients with aml especially those with high white blood cell count should be treated in an experienced tertiary center with a good supportive care team
9285371 for example at st jude we have a dedicated team of clinicians taking care of aml patients and they are more aware of the need to treat hyperleukocytosis are more experienced and are more vigilant in patient care than is usually found at a less specialized hospital
9285372 even though we had dramatically reduced early deaths in this group of patients in the latter period of the study the long term result for patients with these complications was still not good
9285373 we have continued to address their problems with new treatment approaches and have now improved not only the early results but also their long term outcome
9285374 a major issue we face in managing patients with recurrent sarcomas is the paucity of active agents
9285375 there is a limited number of drugs that are active against bone sarcomas and these are usually used as front line treatments when the sarcomas recur we have essentially no active agents
9285376 we were first very careful to see whether we would see any excess toxicity in children compared to that seen in adults
9285377 when we found that the combination was well tolerated we used it in more patients since our colleagues at rady childrens hospital were also using it for refractory sarcoma we decided to pool our data
9285378 further evaluation of this drug combination is warranted in these patients
9285379 sometimes the best preaching we can do is being there with a cup of cold water exhibiting christs spirit of saving others
9285380 this is a cynical move by a government that has constantly ignored the indigenous species of this state
9285381 their record on native rights is appalling and in its present form this legislation is unacceptable because of its divisive overtones
9285382 european domestic species such as sheep and cattle are much better bred than the average queensland voter and would probably be more inclined to support the well thought out farmyard policies of one nation anyway
9285383 once they realise that semi automatic weapons make it easier to control the vermin that prey on defenceless livestock their young kids and offspring they will support us in droves
9285384 power concedes nothing without demand it never has and never will
9285385 he aint got no dick that he can be proud of hes got a little tiny skinny assed dick
9285386 if another severe hurricane hits the u s during these days the publics attention will likely turn away from mccains agenda and the celebration in st paul
9285387 no record will ever go gold again cause theres this thing called limewire
9285388 the conclusion is that the mere presence of ear wax does not require anything
9285389 this finding represents a key extension of other studies on puma because such loss had never been shown before in human cancer
9285390 on the one hand patients receiving traditional chemotherapy can suffer the loss of immune cells and this loss occurs in part because puma induces the death of these cells
9285391 in this case the goal would be to protect patients bone marrow by developing drugs to inhibit puma on the other hand for patients with a lymphoma in which puma was inactivated drugs could be used to reactivate the gene to trigger apoptosis and kill the tumor cells
9285392 some t cell receptors are adept at promoting autoimmunity some are poor and some are protective it is not clear why one t cell receptor can promote autoimmunity whereas another t cell receptor on a similar kind of t cell either doesnt do anything or even protects against autoimmune reaction
9285393 this finding of an association between t cell engraftment and spontaneous disease suggested to us that there is some barrier to the development of disease
9285394 why are cells that engraft better more likely to cause disease we really dont know the answer once the mice start to get disease they get very sick but there is sort of a triggering point our findings may suggest that disease triggering in these models involves a mass effect that requires some quantity of specific t cells to ignite disease but we really want to find out whether it is the cell number itself or whether receptor recognition properties that lead to increased engraftment also lead to increased susceptibility to disease these are things we can test
9285395 these findings dont have a direct clinical implication right now but if we understand which t cells induce pathology and why and which cells are protective or passive we will gain a better sense of where to target what are called antigen specific therapies
9285396 those therapies try to selectively target the t cells that cause disease sparing the rest of the immune system
9285397 even though pneumococcus is very common until recently no one had realized that it could develop this pilus to reach out and touch a human cell
9285398 oral streptococci which are normally in the mouth and throat have the pilus genetic package and we believe pneumococcus picked it up in the back of the throat we decided to look at how the bacterium figures out how to use that package
9285399 when bacteria attack the lung there are two steps they need to do to establish pneumonia
9285400 they need to stick to lung cells and they also need to invade the lung cells our experiments were designed to separately test those two steps and we established that the pili are not used for adhesion but for invasion which was not understood before
9285401 so far only 20 percent or so of the clinically important strains of pneumococci have developed this trick of producing the proteins for making pili
9285402 in creating vaccines we want to use proteins that occur in a wide variety of bacterial strains these pili related proteins are not prime candidates so we can now concentrate on other proteins that we know are expressed almost universally by pneumococci and that we can put into a vaccine
9285403 current vaccines used in the developed world cost over 100 a dose and are limited to protecting against perhaps 10 to 15 types of pneumococci
9285404 but that price is far too high for developing countries and there are 90 types of pneumococci out there
9285405 i was too young at the time to understand why pastor brownjohn kept baptising me
9285406 no one ever told me you were only supposed to be baptised once i never knew how to say no
9285407 i have never had sexual relations with that woman she is an unmarried mother who has been nothing but trouble for this church a temptress from hell ask anyone in the congregation
9285408 my husband is a good preacher a good father and a good pastor to the church
9285409 this trouble all started when jenny came back to the church she is not the same since she came back from the city she is unmarried and wears short dresses and too much makeup i think she is just trying to find a husband
9285410 every time i had to wear a thin white robe
9285411 they all came up to her and congratulated her afterwards while tea and refreshments were being served but they were just pawing at her and the other girls
9285412 afterwards when i spoke to the pastor he said i should consider re dedicating my life to god i felt like slapping him
9285413 now pastor brownjohn and his wife are under so much strain it is distressing to see a christian couple tormented like that it is not doing the church any good mrs brownjohn has been a good wife and always helped at church functions but i think god is testing them and they will be stronger for it afterwards
9285414 she was always doing the washing i only noticed because there were always a lot of white robes hanging on the line at least 3 or 4 times a week very white and not stained at all i dont know how she did it mind you they didnt look like adults clothes at all mrs brownjohn told me her husbands church was very popular with the young people always doing stuff for the kids outreach i think she called it
9285415 because the control of cancer in the bone marrow has improved so much cns relapse has become proportionally more important
9285416 if we are to further increase the cure rate and improve the quality of life of our patients we need to concentrate on preventing cns relapse
9285417 most clinicians still feel strongly that high risk patients need radiation treatment because they think that without radiation such patients have a very high risk of relapse
9285418 but i disagree i think that we should avoid using radiation in all patients even those at high risk of relapse with optimal chemotherapy we can reduce the relapse rate to a very low level we should reserve radiation for the treatment of relapse whats more the salvage rate for cns relapse in patients who did not receive prior radiation is very high and if patients who are treated with radiation develop bone marrow or cns relapse later on it is more difficult to treat them successfully
9285419 optimization of intrathecal therapy to allow adequate distribution of intrathecal therapy in the cns and to avoid traumatic lumbar puncture which leads to an increase in cns relapse are essential for the success of cns directed treatment
9285420 however there are no conclusive trials that show this approach to be superior to intensive chemotherapy
9285421 so whether transplantation has any role in the treatment of isolated cns relapse is uncertain
9285422 cns relapse may just be the tip of the iceberg meaning that while we may see cns relapse there may be hidden leukemia in the bone marrow
9285423 at st jude our treatment protocols involve detecting subclinical cns leukemia early and treating it aggressively
9285424 such treatment has allowed both good cns and bone marrow control therefore we have achieved excellent outcomes for our patients
9285425 wonder if hes going to have her go compete in the miss buffalo chip contest
9285426 we arent exciting the gop base or doing that well among independents and that damned obama just cleaned our clock last night in a speech where he looked like the second coming of jfk weve got to dominate the next news cycle so the talking heads dont have time to praise him and pick off those millions of hillary voters were convinced will vote for us what to do what to do hey how about that gal from alaska shes a good looker might sucker in the young studs and women are so dumb theyll vote for any female over a young black guy and an old white fart uh you know what i mean any day of the week ha ha well call her a feminist just to confuse em plus shes got that whole conservative family values stuff going on jesus five kids and shes only 44 so that cant hurt shes tight with big oil too another plus and shell do what shes told just like alberto and harriet get that sarah up in alaska on the horn
9285427 give the old feller credit though he found a high profile alaskan republican who doesnt have a standing weekly appointment with the fbi
9285428 pat buchanan brought his conservative message of a smaller government and an america first foreign policy to fairbanks and wasilla on friday as he continued a campaign swing through alaska
9285429 to put it bluntly sarah palin is no hillary clinton nor does she have the vision and brilliance of barack obama this is an incredible insult to most american women just how stupid does he think we are
9285430 do the republicans think that all women are interchangeable what an insult
9285431 shes easily the least experienced running mate in recent memory which is pretty scary given mccains age and his history of cancer
9285432 its important that america has a vice president who has eaten a mooseburger
9285433 this motility is also called dancing because when you electrically stimulate an outer hair cell with a sound the cell body spontaneously elongates and contracts along with the sound
9285434 it is very dramatic to see these hair cells dance with the sound
9285435 we found that these mice showed exactly the same kinds of hearing deficiency as the previous knockout mice
9285436 therefore we believe that these experiments eliminate criticism of our earlier experiments with the knockout mice
9285437 with this study we still cannot really exclude stereociliary motility from contributing to cochlear amplification because eliminating somatic motility also reduces ciliary motility so it is not possible to totally isolate either form of motility in fact we hypothesize that the two mechanisms might work together in different aspects of amplification
9285438 for example an overdose of aspirin causes a high frequency hearing loss by inhibiting prestins function
9285439 also there is evidence that many cases of high frequency hearing loss are caused by defects in the cells molecular machinery that involves prestin and two mutations that have been detected in the prestin gene in humans are reported to be associated with deafness
9285440 what is it exactly that the vp does every day
9285441 i race cars i play tennis i fondle women but i have weekends off and i am my own boss
9285442 i dismantle the constitution i destroy the country i tell senators to go fuck themselves but i have weekends off and i shoot my friends in the face
9285443 youd be surprised how big the vp job is these days
9285444 the act or practice of deceiving concealment or distortion of the truth for the purpose of misleading duplicity fraud cheating once she exposed their deceit no one ever trusted them again
9285445 we moved to the sidewalk a few people stayed in the street because we didnt want a confrontation but it didnt matter people started pleading let me go i want to go home
9285446 some of the police on horses were whacking people with their batons i was told later that the police were telling us to disperse but i didnt hear them say that and where would we go the police were all around us not letting us leave
9285447 street medics took care of those who had been pepper sprayed and we shared water and made sure everyone was okay
9285448 now because of the plea bargain im free but on probation i cant join any more marches or do anything illegal in the next six months or ill get five days in jail on top of the other charges
9285449 do i look like a prostitute and i mean that in the professional choice sense cos im sure some most are far more pretty than i am
9285450 did he recognise me as a spanking model and confuse me with being a prostitute which i have well ranted on in previous posts
9285451 would i get out of bed to do anything for 20 anyway and or with someone who has the gall to proposition a girl minding her own business who is not standing on a street corner with a red light flashing or any other flicker of interest
9285452 should i wear trousers or a skirt down to my ankles rather than my usual shortish above the knee ones when im in public
9285453 20 cheap at the price or prey for the pinball wizard
9285454 this is probably the first description of what is happening mechanistically that contributes to the ability of cells to delay apoptosis
9285455 it provides incredible insights into how three proteins work and how they can control apoptosis
9285456 this suggests that the protein is playing basically the same role in humans as we described in mice
9285457 that was intriguing because several studies suggested that hax1 was controlled by cytokine signaling
9285458 also studies have suggested that if you overexpressed hax1 in cells the cells were protected from undergoing apoptosis
9285459 that additional window of survival is extremely important because in the body cytokines are limiting
9285460 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
9285461 it is always gratifying to see one of the nci designated cancer centers achieve comprehensive status recognition of excellence not only in state of the art care and cancer research but also in patient education community outreach and the dissemination of vital information to professionals and the public
9285462 these extra efforts to establish programs that reach out to surrounding communities and patients are the hallmarks of our comprehensive centers which now number 41 this enhanced designation is a timely recognition of important contributions and advances made by the dedicated staff of st jude
9285463 being designated a comprehensive cancer center is a prestigious accomplishment and to be the only pediatric center is an incomparable distinction for st jude
9285464 st jude is well known for having innovative programs led by the best and the brightest faculty and staff now being awarded comprehensive stature places an additional nci imprimatur on st jude and further validates our position among the countrys leading cancer centers this also speaks volumes about dr kastans strong leadership as our cancer center director
9285465 its rewarding to see a designation of comprehensive to an institution that is exclusively focused on children
9285466 they have a huge population of survivors that they alone have the resources and capability to bring back for follow up studies so they are to be congratulated and envied in that they are the only uniquely pediatric cancer center in the country
9285467 our international outreach program directed by dr raul ribeiro is a wonderful example of how a medical institution can provide important services to local national and worldwide communities
9285468 in addition to the effective web based efforts st jude has a long and successful track record of bringing modern medicine to less advantaged countries through education of local health care providers and establishment of pediatric cancer clinics
9285469 while maintaining significant activities in education and community service st jude will continue its major efforts in both basic laboratory research and clinical investigation to better understand the biology of cancer and develop novel treatment approaches
9285470 all we had to do was take off our frightening masks and step from the shadows
9285471 i wonder if we have any control over our destinies or if we are just biomass manipulated by an intelligent evolutionary process itself
9285472 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
9285473 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
9285474 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
9285475 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
9285476 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
9285477 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
9285478 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
9285479 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
9285480 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
9285481 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
9285482 ill be damned if i let another young person be sent to war and come home like this
9285483 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
9285484 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
9285485 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
9285486 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells
9285487 what we found is that using a lower dose of the sonic hedgehog inhibitor in combination with bmp gives the same therapeutic effect as high doses of the hedgehog inhibitor
9285488 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
9285489 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
9285490 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
9285491 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure
9285492 commonly when a child has bilateral disease the surgeon will remove the kidney that has the most tumor and do a partial nephrectomy on the other side
9285493 but if a patient then develops problems in the remaining kidney the options are limited because one kidney has been taken out of the equation at st jude we try to save as much kidney as possible in children with bilateral disease thus far 100 percent of the time we have been able to save normal kidney on both sides
9285494 autophagy is a cell survival jack of all trades and were trying to understand the signals that trigger its onset
9285495 this process developed so early in the evolution of life that at least some types of microorganisms must have learned how to avoid this defensive response of the cell to being invaded we want to know how invading microorganisms avoid being destroyed by autophagy and learn how cancer cells use autophagy to resist chemotherapy drugs before they have a chance to work
9285496 we suspected that because tlr signaling triggers both phagocytosis and autophagy that this signal might also link these activities together as well as enable each process to occur separately
9285497 this would make sense since autophagy kills microorganisms that invade the cell and phagocytosis deliberately brings microorganisms into the cell to destroy them so having two totally separate and unrelated sets of signals to do a similar job would be like re inventing the biochemical wheel
9285498 this strongly suggested that tlr recruits parts of the autophagy machinery to enable the phagosome to fully develop and fuse with the lysosome even if autophagy itself doesnt occur simultaneously
9285499 we can actually see phagocytosis take place in live cells and we can study it in detail so we know the steps involved
9285500 but autophagy seems to occur suddenly and we know about it only after its very obviously underway now that we discovered that phagocytosis uses some of the same biochemical signals as autophagy does we can use that information to solve the mystery of how autophagy works we hope that we will be able to translate that new knowledge in the future into improved treatments for infections and cancer
9285501 gene expression profiling will help us identify targets for future therapy
9285502 it is still crude but in the end you identify multiple genes for further study if you find a good target for therapy the next step is to develop molecular therapeutics for the target
9285503 pharmacogenetics is important to finding out a persons response and tolerance for a therapy
9285504 certain drugs may be good for 99 percent of patients but bad for 1 percent we need to find out who those patients are who are at risk so we can spare them from toxicity
9285505 we need to know the leukemic cell genetics that affect drug sensitivity or resistance and what role pharmacogenetics plays in treatment to improve efficacy and decrease toxicity
9285506 that way we dont over treat low risk patients or under treat high risk patients
9285507 come on get on with it get to the point we havent all day

9285515 the key observation was that hax1 was important in helping cells to survive importantly what happened to the mice we generated was remarkably similar to what happens if you remove the mitochondrial enzymes called htra2 or parl
9285516 these findings provide new avenues to pursue to gain a better understanding of these disease processes and ultimately to develop better therapies
9285517 it really takes a series of genetic lesions to lead to cancer
9285518 you may get activation of an oncogene but you may also need activation of a tumor suppressor gene and an alteration in a cell death pathway
9285519 it appears from our study and other work published previously that all you need to get cml is that chromosomal translocation and bcr abl1 expression
9285520 the vast majority of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemias are of b cell lineage
9285521 the loss of the ikaros gene is a nearly obligatory lesion for the development of bcr abl1 all
9285522 and clearly must be a genetic lesion that is cooperating with bcr abl1
9285523 that is an important finding that may give insight into how that transformation occurs or it may give insight into a better way to treat the disease if one can figure out how the ikaros deletion is working
9285524 many times physicians will look at a childs scans and assume that it is impossible to remove the tumor while preserving some uninvolved kidney but our study indicates that surgeons should not rely solely on the imaging to make that decision
9285525 in most cases the surgeon will be able to save normal kidney on both sides
9285526 the study indicates that when combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy this surgical approach provides an opportunity to preserve renal function while maintaining a high probability of cure

9285529 we think we have identified a pathway that can be used to prevent tumor formation and a potential target for therapy
9285530 we were interested in whether there were signals that inhibited tumor formation
9285531 and if there were which ones were they could they be used to identify new therapeutic targets
9285532 what was not known and what we now find is that the effect of bmps on normal gnp cells is almost exactly mimicked in gnp like tumor cells

9285534 we hope that by reducing the levels of both compounds we might prevent the secondary effects on bone of this potential therapy
9285535 effector t cells mediate immune responses like accelerators make cars go forward while a specialized population called regulatory t cells stop an immune response like brakes slow down a car
9285536 regulatory t cells actively suppress the activation of effector t cells that are reactive and damaging to self tissues thereby preventing autoimmune disease
9285537 in the context of an infection after the effector t cell has orchestrated the correct immune response and the pathogen is gone regulatory t cells can help calm down the immune system
9285538 in contrast there are very few that issue stop signals only two or three so il 35 is special
9285539 this discovery adds significantly to our understanding of how these cells prevent immune responses from running out of control and causing damage
9285540 to return to the car analogy il 35 may turn out to be a very important brake for the immune system
9285541 there is mounting evidence that regulatory t cells stop our ability to eradicate tumors
9285542 tumors produce a dilemma within the immune system on one hand the system wants to get rid of the tumor cells but on the other hand theyre a part of us thus regulatory t cells may prevent the immune system from attacking the tumor experimental studies have shown that if you can remove regulatory t cells or dampen their activity then tumor immunity becomes vigorous and the body can get rid of the tumor
9285543 regulatory t cells are seen as a major impediment to the development of effective anti cancer vaccines and may prevent sterilizing immunity in certain chronic infections such as hepatitis c and tuberculosis
9285544 blocking the activity of il 35 may reduce the function of regulatory t cells and their ability to block anti tumor immune responses so treatments that block il 35 activity may make anti cancer vaccines more effective
9285545 when i interviewed with dario he said the best thing about st jude is that your only limitation is your imagination and he was right
9285546 one of the best things about science is the fact that your discovery attracts the interest of other bright minds other scientists will hear about il 35 and say maybe this new protein is important in the disease process or condition that im studying by collaborating with others whose expertise is different than ours we can hasten progress
9285547 i believe this protein has a good chance of having therapeutic applications
9285548 im a st jude donor myself and like other donors i think its important to remember that at the end of the day the goal of our research is to treat patients especially the children we have here at st jude
9285549 each year the samaritan award is given to a broadcaster or organization that exemplifies the industrys commitment to serving the public interest through the airwaves
9285550 country cares is a program that truly embodies the spirit of this award as apparent through their tireless fundraising efforts and dedication to serving the patients of st jude childrens research hospital
9285551 its time to hand the torch to the next generation of young people to continue this important role of st jude in the international community
9285552 dr websters legacy is that he has highlighted the importance of the avian reservoir of influenza as it relates to human health
9285553 we now know that the avian reservoir is the initial source for all human flu he has helped the world understand that we need to keep an eye on whats going on in the animal populations and communicate with each other about those changes
9285554 richard has attended who meetings and has been accepted by the international community
9285555 our report reflects how adept st jude has become at designing and conducting even complex clinical trials for twinning through iop
9285556 this is a powerful strategy for sharing our knowledge and skills with countries that have excellent clinicians but limited resources
9285557 through twinning we can ensure delivery of state of the art therapy to children in other countries while identifying additional research opportunities
9285558 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
9285559 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
9285560 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
9285561 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
9285562 decreased levels of transforming growth factor beta and increased levels of jnk are known to be associated with the transformation of myeloid cells into leukemic cells in humans
9285563 so those findings in our lab suggest once again that n myc is linked to aml
9285564 by eliminating il 3 from the culture we were able to unmask the apoptotic effect of n myc which greatly increased cell death
9285565 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
9285566 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
9285567 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
9285568 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
9285569 corporate cartographers are demolishing thousands of years of history not to mention britains remarkable geography at a stroke by not including them on maps which millions of us now use every day were in real danger of losing what makes maps so unique giving us a feel for a place even if weve never been there
9285570 but its not just google its nokia microsoft maps on satellite navigation tools its diluting the quality of the graphic image that we call a map
9285571 offers a quick and easy way to explore typographic alternatives and see the impact that various elements of type have on the overall look and feel of a map
9285572 making eagles on the tour takes on a whole new meaning with the eagles for st jude program because i know my accomplishments help st jude achieve its mission to find cures for these special children
9285573 it touches my heart to see these brave kids they have so much courage to fight it makes me feel proud every time i make an eagle and it gives me added drive and passion to play my best golf
9285574 st jude is vital in the battle against catastrophic childhood diseases and we want the world to know it it is our hope that the eagles for st jude program will increase awareness for this special place and encourage golf fans and those who support st jude to donate to this worthy cause
9285575 eagles for st jude is a wonderfully unique program that shows stanfords amazing commitment to the kids of st jude it will be thrilling to watch the eagles accumulating throughout the pga tour knowing that each one will help support st judes ground breaking research and life saving care
9285576 give thanks for the healthy kids in your life and give to those who are not
9285577 i am so proud that these buildings are joining the thanks and giving campaign to support st jude
9285578 jim nantz has received many awards and honors in his outstanding career with cbs sports
9285579 to have the honor to present him an award that bears my name will indeed be a very special moment for me
9285580 at univision and at each of the local stations in the univision radio network we are proud of the role we play for hispanics in the united states
9285581 our work with st jude is another example of our commitment to our communities the amazing response of our staff and listeners since we started our partnership 10 years ago demonstrates the importance of the st jude message of hope
9285582 we are very fortunate to have the support from univision radio and the hispanic community to ensure that no child is ever turned away from receiving treatment because of a familys inability to pay
9285583 we want the community to know that every donation even as little as 20 a month makes a difference in saving a childs life at st jude
9285584 part of my job is to motivate people when i see this for myself i want to make sure we have a very successful radiothon
9285585 eighty five percent of every dollar received comes to the hospital thats a very high number for any charity
9285586 i saw every hallway every child and every smile as i was sharing with my listeners
9285587 it makes you feel good to know you are a part of this
9285588 a series of complex developmental processes must be carefully orchestrated for the eye to form correctly
9285589 one important aspect of this coordination is that retinal thickness be the same irrespective of eye size for example the mouse eye is about 5 000 times smaller than that of the elephant eye but the retinal thickness in these two species is comparable
9285590 this represents the first example of a role for a myc gene in retinal development
9285591 on the basis of our data we propose that n myc plays a central role in coordinating retinal proliferation with eye growth during development
9285592 the determination of n myc target genes during retinal development may also contribute to the current understanding of retinoblastoma progression
9285593 importantly for retinas to maintain nearly constant thickness across species that have different sizes of eyes the total number of retinal cells must change several fold
9285594 the identification of n myc as a key regulator of these processes allows us to begin to understand the coordination of complex developmental programs in the developing eye and how these processes have evolved
9285595 i have to be honest i didnt know much about st jude childrens research hospital before the create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign in 2006
9285596 that was my first introduction to the hospital and i was real excited about the fundraiser i got involved right away in doing whatever i could to make it a success but i have to say that this year is so much more personal for me
9285597 there was a pearl like reflective glow to her eye
9285598 we looked at them wondering if this was going to be katie soon
9285599 a lot of times in children as young as katie the treatment breaks down the bones in the face
9285600 they were tactful and truthful that meant a lot we made the decision based on quality of life concerns we felt it was best for her but that didnt make it easy
9285601 even people we just briefly met they all let us know that they were there for whatever we needed
9285602 we got messages and e mails from chilis employees all over the country sending us their thoughts and prayers
9285603 thats huge thats huge when youre going through this theyve given us all the time off weve needed to take care of our family were very grateful to have that
9285604 it was a shock to see her hooked up to the iv lines and oxygen
9285605 well forget that she lost an eye we honestly forget
9285606 we joke that every time she comes home from the hospital she has a new toy
9285607 once she gets outside she loves nothing better than just running through the grass
9285608 if we find a resource to help us and we think it might help another store we share it
9285609 i think this approach will be just as effective if not more
9285610 we can all make a difference in the lives of others im proud to help st jude i feel like im just a regular person helping out
9285611 showcase is a fun filled weekend of events for the whole family to enjoy it features mans best friend working to provide funds for the best friend of children in need st jude
9285612 this is truly a win win event because the thousands of out of town exhibitors also have a major impact on the memphis economy
9285613 there are a lot of heroes out there in radio who continue to make this happen
9285614 im just so happy and surprised by all the people especially in country music whove taken st jude to heart
9285615 he put on a mask too when we had our picture taken together
9285616 im just excited to be here doing what i can to help
9285617 the artists who come here need to take what theyve learned and pass it on the type of care offered here is revolutionary
9285618 all these people took the time out of their busy schedules to come here and help the kids
9285619 i dont want people to ever forget about st jude
9285620 i think it will hit me on sunday but i cant wait to get on stage
9285621 i think it will hit me on sunday but i cant wait to get on stage
9285622 it is interesting that events that occurred in north america over 140 years ago not only still reverberate here but also have echoes in europe
9285623 long lived cells like those in the brain arent constantly being replaced like red blood cells are
9285624 these cells must have a way to remain healthy for a long time getting rid of mitochondria that threaten the cell by making ros is one of those strategies
9285625 the fact that reticulocytes must eject their mitochondria in order to form red blood cells makes it the perfect model for studying programmed mitochondrial clearance
9285626 the identification of nix as a protein that regulates programmed mitochondrial clearance is a significant advance because of the importance of this process in the health of long lived cells like those in the heart and brain
9285627 one of the main reasons my family and i support st jude is because there is always something you can do for someone else
9285628 it costs more than 1 2 million a day to run st jude so every penny counts whats really cool about st jude is that it doesnt matter about things like race religion or a familys inability to pay they are really here to help the kids and that is what is really important it is great to be able to encourage kids to learn and help other kids at the same time
9285629 on behalf of the entire global stanford financial group of companies let me say how honored we are to present this check to st jude childrens research hospital
9285630 this tournament is the flagship event for stanfords global relationship with st jude and we look forward to continuing to work together to raise funds and awareness for the battle against childhood cancer we were very pleased with the success of this years tournament our first as title sponsor and to be able to present the largest donation in the history of this event is a true honor for me st jude and these incredible kids is the reason we are involved and im delighted that we can do our part to help st jude work its miracles
9285631 with our donation today and as we have for the last 22 years fedex has supported the incredibly important work being done at st jude childrens research hospital
9285632 we remain strongly committed to this great organization through our continued involvement with the stanford st jude championship and we look forward to carrying on our charitable giving on a national level through the many opportunities with our sponsorship of the fedexcup
9285633 obviously i have my own motivation to make as many eagles as possible but with the eagles for st jude program theres an even greater reward when i do so eagles for st jude allows me to share that good feeling that i have on the golf course and turn it into something truly lasting and meaningful off the golf course i feel like my accomplishments help st jude accomplish its mission to find cures for these special children
9285634 we are grateful to stanford financial group and fedex for their commitment to make this event even more successful than in years past to see a professional like vijay singh get behind our event and support it with both his time and his money is very gratifying we see the stanford st jude championship only growing and we know thats because of the sincere and long term commitment by these incredible partners
9285635 proteasome inhibitors are currently being used to treat some types of cancer including multiple myelomas although many aspects of this cellular process remain poorly understood
9285636 our study sheds new light on how that process works
9285637 we wanted to determine what happens to defective heavy and light chains in plasma cells so we could get a better understanding of the molecules and channels that allow these cells to get rid of defective proteins that cant be used to make antibodies
9285638 the class of cancer drugs called proteasome inhibitors block endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation as well as the destruction of proteins from other parts of the cells and cause defective proteins to overload this system
9285639 we want to fully understand how endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation works for antibodies made by plasma cells so we can design more specific ways to block this process in myelomas
9285640 our study shows for the first time the role herp plays at the retrotranslocon
9285641 the study also describes how non glycosylated proteins are removed from the endoplasmic reticulum and disposed of this information helps to explain how the process works and how we might design ways to block it in cancer cells
9285642 in addition to fulfilling your new years fitness resolutions and raising needed funds for the children of st jude this is also your opportunity to be a part of history by creating a new guinness world record for the most abdominal crunches done in one hour by a group
9285643 im extremely proud to lead this national campaign to benefit a very worthy cause while educating women on the importance of strengthening their core as a first step to greater fitness
9285644 st jude is an incredible research center where doctors and researchers are committed to saving the lives of children with cancer and other deadly diseases
9285645 our family is forever grateful for the courageous people at st jude and all that they do ab crunch challenge participants will be a part of a vital team supporting the hospitals life saving work and ensuring that no child is ever turned away because of a familys inability to pay
9285646 a certain man went down from jerusalem to jericho and fell among thieves who stripped him of his clothes and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead
9285647 and many came that way and when they saw him passed by on the other side
9285648 but a certain samaritan as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him
9285649 and went to him and bound up his wounds and set him on his own beast and brought him to an inn and took care of him
9285650 and on the next day when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the inn keeper and said unto him take care of him and whatsoever though spendest more when i come again i will repay you
9285651 one hundred and one years ago our people began a migration to the blessed shores of these united states of america seeking the freedoms and opportunities won for us by our founding fathers
9285652 therefore we who are proud of our heritage have met in washington d
9285653 we at long long last shall take our rightful place in this community of nationalities standing proudly with our heads held high in the knowledge that we have earned the right to perpetuate the name of our heritage and maintain our reputation as unquestioned good american citizens
9285654 with these thoughts engraved in my mind and my heart i shall call upon that powerful patron st
9285655 to this preamble i hereby dedicate my life and affix my signature
9285656 i myself am made entirely of flaws stitched together with good intentions
9285657 this is a call to the global community that it is possible to increase pediatric cancer survival even in countries that have high under 5 mortality rates for other causes such as infectious diseases
9285658 with a modest financial investment we can improve survival very quickly
9285659 that is because these countries have developed twinning programs with st jude and other institutions
9285660 the data show a modest investment in health if it is well organized can produce an incredible increase in pediatric cancer survival
9285661 countries with limited resources should not be afraid to tackle pediatric cancer as a national health priority because they can have decent programs if they make a relatively small investment
9285662 and that investment can come from outside sources as well
9285663 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
9285664 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
9285665 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
9285666 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
9285667 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
9285668 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
9285669 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
9285670 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
9285671 if i could put together a pack of books other than the bible for a young minister that would be genuinely helpful to him or her as they started in ministry what would i include
9285672 the discovery is important because it explains why patients with sialidosis have enlarged spleens and suggests that new drugs or gene therapies that target that problem might be an effective therapy
9285673 the results also explain how the loss of neu1 can cause bone marrow transplantations to fail and therefore suggests that such failures might also be corrected by target therapeutics
9285674 our work represents an unexpected and important clue to one of the prominent clinical manifestations of sialidosis patients
9285675 we were surprised to discover that an old ubiquitous enzyme in lysosomes better known for digesting cellular waste products plays such an important role in a basic biological process that when exacerbated contributes to the outcome of such a terrible disease in children
9285676 the evidence strongly suggests that in children lacking a normal gene for neu1 disruption of the bone marrow environment causes the exodus of hematopoietic cells from the marrow to the spleen
9285677 that leads to development of the symptoms of sialidosis although we dont have a cure for this terrible disease we are now beginning to identify alternative ways to improve the disease outcome in affected children
9285678 the exciting thing about this work is that it sheds light on two major issues the cause of sialidosis and the reason for bone marrow transplantation failure in the absence of neu1
9285679 this wealth of new information gives us a better understanding of the physiological function of neu1 which appears to be much broader than originally thought this illustrates the important role of basic research in making discoveries that have major implications for medical problems
9285680 that was a little bit too much information because i dont want anyone getting in touch with my medical records because i have had my identity stolen before and i am still fighting with it in the credit bureau
9285681 the new information is important because it helps identify children who are most at risk for severe disease using easily available clinical information
9285682 this narrows down the patient population who needs to be considered for antiviral therapy which is costly and often inconvenient to receive from a childs perspective for example one treatment for rsv infection is to have the child breathe an aerosolized form of the antiviral drug ribavirin for 12 to 18 hours which is tough for the child and the parent
9285683 this finding is important because with cancer patients clinicians are used to identifying those at risk for bacterial and fungal infections based on a patient having neutropenia
9285684 we decided to analyze the course of rsv infection in children being treated for cancer to identify factors that could help us predict which ones were at highest risk for severe disease or death due to a lower respiratory tract infection with this virus
9285685 a powerful line of supreme court authority suggesting that legislative history should rarely be used in statutory interpretation
9285686 congress intended 4302 b only to prohibit the limiting of userras substantive rights by union contracts and collective bargaining agreements and that congress did not refer to arbitration agreements between an employer and individual employee
9285687 the same reasoning applies to userra which like the adea and title vii affords both civil actions by the agency and private actions by an employee
9285688 even if garrett had chosen to involve the attorney general nothing in userra suggests that the attorney general would not have been able to represent garrett in arbitration
9285689 through their dedication nearly 75 000 chilis grill amp bar team members made the 2007 create a pepper to fight childhood cancer campaign a resounding success
9285690 this years campaign once again exceeded our highest expectations totaling more than 8 2 million for the patients of st jude bringing us closer to our goal of raising 50 million and making the chilis care center building we are dedicating today a reality
9285691 as we stand at the foot of the chilis care center in celebration today i want to thank chilis grill amp bar and our other partners who helped make this dream possible we are truly overwhelmed by your dedication to help st jude provide unsurpassed patient care and unparalleled scientific research and you can know that you have helped bring hope to thousands of children from around the world
9285692 the chilis care center is a significant part of our long term strategy to translate basic research at st jude into the most advanced and effective care of patients
9285693 integrating patient care and research holds the key to more rapid advances in science and medicine this new facility will help us maintain our leadership role in defining the forefront of research to advance the treatment of children with cancer and other catastrophic pediatric diseases
9285694 the lesson for plaintiffs is in the vast majority of cases they are perceiving the defendants offer to be half a loaf when in fact it is an entire loaf or more
9285695 um can you step in here because i dont have the authority to rip this person a new one thanks
9285696 the principles and authorities cited by the employer are well accepted rational and worthy of consideration in the parties future dealings with each other
9285697 all of the materials are provided for you and are ready to use so all we had to do was make it happen
9285698 with st jude we play our music our format isnt disrupted
9285699 even if a radio station isnt ready to put on their own radiothons
9285700 they should definitely visit another stations event to see what goes on
9285701 the people that tune you in keep us moving forward
9285702 if you go out to eat for lunch or dinner on september 24 by going to chilis you will help seriously ill children become the ultimate survivors on that day chilis restaurants nationwide will be donating all their profits to support st jude
9285703 because we share a common background we understand the little quirks that may pop up
9285704 having gone through the same thing we know exactly what we need to do for each other to make things better
9285705 its amazing all the changes since 1998 when we were last here
9285706 set up your own routine is clunky and rather limited given the scope of amp 101xercises provided do yourself a favor and avoid this title instead pick up the abs diet get fit stay fit plan which is much more complete modern and useful
9285707 anti cardio its just that cardio is not nearly as effective and
9285708 cardio such as tennis or walking continue to do so if those activities give you that enjoyment this program will only serve to enhance those activities you just dont have to do them to be healthy
9285709 vidoes they arent instructional videos on how to bellydance gracefully
9285710 thanks to the 13 chefs for their work in preparing the meals for guests and to mikey flowers who filled our space with beautiful flowers of all kinds
9285711 we raised 610 000 for the hospital and had a wonderful time going about it my thanks to the forbes family for allowing us the use of their yacht which added to the events theme
9285712 thanks to everyone that made our st jude event one very classy night to remember god bless all the people involved with st jude and god bless all the children
9285713 were going to have a banner hanging in our student union that says we are the 2006 2007 national champions
9285714 but the only thing harder than being no 1 is staying no 1
9285715 i have no idea if we are going to reach it but we will give it our best shot
9285716 for the first three years i helped peripherally i got prizes for their events
9285717 i saw it as a program that had a lot of potential
9285718 i thought it was something we could really turn into something big
9285719 weve had some great support and some great students and it has worked out for us these past few years
9285720 what i had been told about the hospital didnt compare to what it is actually like there
9285721 talking with students from other colleges and hearing about the programs that work for them was very educational
9285722 it gives us new ideas on what we can do at our campus
9285723 if we start making it a competition we lose sight of what st jude is about
9285724 we have 16 000 people on our campus and 10 percent of them participate in the event id like to believe we can get more than that if we do our job right in promoting the hospital the money will come
9285725 i think its best described in the way brooklyn smiles every day how shes a beautiful vibrant outspoken 3 year old and the way shes so full of life
9285726 i see the other survivors and i know even though we shared a different time and a different era that we all have the same thing in common
9285727 we were all patients here at a place that was our last hope
9285728 adam and stuart are both ranked among the top 50 players in the world and sean is making a big impact this year on the pga tour we still have two weeks before the commitment deadline and we already have one of the best fields weve ever had so we are very excited
9285729 all the things that i wish i had told him all the thanks the news i could still tell him the conversation goes on
9285730 surely you must have some sort of defense mechanism that enables you to look away from all that sadness or numb yourself to the horror of a dying child
9285731 show me my way in life and i will build you a shrine
9285732 non profit non sectarian charitable corporation titled alsac dedicated to the parable of the good samaritan to love and care for our neighbor regardless of color or creed
9285733 i call it the hand of god pushing williams pencil
9285734 as alsac celebrates its 50th anniversary we recognize the organizations unwavering support for st jude
9285735 we are immensely proud of the fact that no child has ever been turned away from st jude because of an inability to pay and we at alsac know that our success and the success of the hospital has been solely dependent on the kindness and generosity of our donors alsac was founded on the principle of the good samaritan we have been fortunate to know and call as friends hundreds of thousands of good hearted donors in our half century of service
9285736 son go inside and up the stairs and tell mr thomas that we are ready
9285737 i was told to tell mr thomas they are ready for him
9285738 they are joining in a personal way in the lifetime dream of my husband danny thomas in doing so members are ensuring the hospitals growth and effectiveness its preeminence in the world of medicine and its stature as a symbol of hope for children in the world
9285739 in 1962 of all of you standing only this group seated would have survived acute lymphoblastic leukemia
9285740 our goal is not to get bigger but to get better
9285741 it was everything we could do to save the lives of the children stricken with cancer
9285742 i expected to see a regular hospital i was not expecting to see a wonder world we feel very humble to be a part of this
9285743 donating our estate to st jude was the best decision my husband and i have made
9285744 we are relieved to see our estate going to such a great cause
9285745 there is always something new it is a living organism and the need to be a part of it is contagious
9285746 we speak frequently and proudly about the medical marvels that take place within the walls of st jude
9285747 but we all know none of this could be accomplished without the love dedication and financial support of each and every volunteer partner corporate sponsor and donor it is because of you that the most gifted doctors and scientists in the world come here to do their finest work
9285748 but because they are priceless god has blessed us with an army of truly dedicated individuals who are committed to the dream of danny thomas and the mission of st jude
9285749 i know if my father were here he would want randy to have this award
9285750 i didnt have the chance to know him as well as some of you but it shows you how a good man can inspire you in just a brief time
9285751 for the past five years countless latin artists and singers have truly embraced the life mission of st jude by supporting the angels amp stars gala
9285752 thanks to their contribution and charitable donations they are helping us save the lives of children with deadly diseases
9285753 fedex is proud to continue increasing critical awareness and philanthropic support for st jude
9285754 by partnering with talented celebrities and community leaders we help st jude children overcome illness and triumph over disease giving them much needed hope to persevere
9285755 help me find my way in life and i will build you a shrine
9285756 this is a fitting moment in the evolution of the growth of st jude
9285757 richard shadyac is a visionary an excellent planner and his focus his tenacity his dedication and his passion for st jude are unrelenting
9285758 i became an arkansas state trooper i married my high school sweetheart i have two wonderful children and three grandchildren
9285759 how proud he would be of all of you how proud he would be of his grandchildren singing out for alsac and how proud he would be of alsac the organization that was born in his heart and built on his faith fifty years later you are still the warriors slaying the dragons that would take children from their mothers and fathers
9285760 the metaphoric rock upon which alsac was built 50 years ago
9285761 the responsibility of alsac is herculean in scope to maintain the largest pediatric research center in the world like the inn keeper who was left with the guardianship of the suffering man we at alsac also stand guard
9285762 do you think im ok i did it all correctly right
9285763 if ugandans would smile when they walk there would be a lot less people killed on the roads at night
9285764 iemand die werkelijk wil weten wie hij is zou een kalme fanatieke verzamelaar van teleurstellingen moeten zijn en het op zoek gaan naar teleurstellingen zou voor hem een verslaving moeten zijn de allesbepalende verslaving in zijn leven want zo iemand zou met grote helderheid onder ogen zien dat de teleurstelling niet een brandend verwoestend gif is maar een koele verzachtende balsem die ons de ogen opent voor de ware contouren van onszelf
9285765 if you have a deep fat fryer i can service you
9285766 theres no sick days very little vacation you have to worry about health care costs
9285767 i didnt go running up to him like many did
9285768 the central premise of star trek the experience is that alien researchers and scientists along with their necessary support staff and materiel were transported via a temporal rift from the late 24th century to present u2013day las vegas to study and interact with the various cultures of 21st century earth
9285769 the rift however has recently grown unstable therefore the time station must be abandoned
9285770 extensive research was done to assure the ceremony which rings down the curtain on the seventy nine million dollar 65 000 square foot complex will follow the actual procedure for decommissioning a u s navy vessel as closely as possible
9285771 in keeping with over forty plus years of established star trek themes of exploration and cooperation we felt the pride in being a part of that legacy should be reflected in a dignified but joyful leave taking although we wish we could do so much more our fans and friends expect nothing less since the june announcement of our closure weve received tens of thousands of e mails and messages of support the outpouring of affection is just overwhelming and is visible as our wall of memories just inside the attraction we hope that everyone who has ever felt or wanted to be a part of our star trek family will join us on september 1st to help celebrate over ten years of one of the most thrilling interactive attractions ever conceived
9285772 the final vip show will consist of twenty seven guests who will travel to the 24th century to experience borg invasion 4 d and klingon encounter as they conclude their ten year mission in addition to being part of this once in a lifetime opportunity you will also be seated in the exclusive vip seats for the decommissioning ceremony receive a special commemorative item and be invited to attend the private staff party after the ceremony
9285773 the idea is to make the whole experience a blend of education and entertainment it isnt just effective but is extremely interactive amongst the movie lovers
9285774 although one needs to watch the movie with 3 d glasses one can have a multi sensory experience which is not involved in a 3 d or 4 d film the seats supplied by simnora have special effects for water jet passage tickling effect air nozzles and a fragrance nozzle the evolution of our country can be seen in a varied manner
9285775 the entire production unit at israel is extremely professional the concept that has been a huge success in israel for 11 years will definitely lure movie lovers in india
9285776 not yet but we have plans of introducing the format at popular tourist destinations such as jaipur and goa indian culture and entertainment are very popular the world over and we plan to launch it at international airport terminals
9285777 and im determined never to work with them ever again because of my experience on i robot
9285778 i mean the teeth are really important i think frank langella in the dracula movie that was made in the 70s i think he didnt want to have teeth in the movie but no i like the teeth i want to see girls with a lot of teeth
9285779 i know what to do we must cool down the materials until their temperature is lower than their ignition temperature and then the fire will go out
9285780 no no i know what to do we must cut off the supply of oxygen so that the fire will go out due to lack of one of the reactants
9285781 bare windswept slope of ice projecting spine of ice stepped backward into the abyss
9285782 restless crowd with its panoply of cameras wharton 1995 2007 274
9285783 and theres a cabaret in there actually theres a gay cabaret on tonight if youre into that kind of thing
9285784 i figured hes a politician theyre politically correct about this kind of thing
9285785 isnt she the governor of alaska who doesnt want to live in juneau and wants to drill the hell out of her state
9285786 general secretary gorbachev if you seek peace if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe if you seek liberalization come here to this gate mr gorbachev open this gate mr gorbachev tear down this wall
9285787 four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal
9285788 these republican leaders have not been content with attacks on me or my wife or on my sons no not content with that they now include my little dog fala well of course i dont resent attacks and my family doesnt resent attacks but fala does resent them you know fala is scotch and his scotch soul was furious he has not been the same dog since
9285789 because there was no platform upon which they could stand
9285790 ive stopped wasteful spending cut taxes and put the people first
9285791 i would be honoured to serve next to the next president of the united states
9285792 i know it will demand the best that i have to give and i promise nothing less
9285793 as a mother of one of those troops john mccain is the kind of man i want as our commander in chief
9285794 it will work senator mccains wrong on that issue i think hes going to evolve into eventually supporting anwr opening obama is way off base on all that i think those politicians who dont understand that we need more domestic supplies of energy thrown into our hungry markets are living in la la land
9285795 what is it exactly that the vp does every day im used to being very productive and working real hard and being in administration
9285796 a couple of lawmakers who were unhappy with that decision are looking at me as a target right now and wanting to probe and find out why i replace this cabinet member and its cool i want them to ask me these questions i dont have anything to hide and didnt do anything wrong there it is a governors prerogative i never tried to fire my former brother in law
9285797 if the alaskan state legislature passed a death penalty law i would sign it we have a right to know that someone who rapes and murders a child or kills an innocent person in a drive by shooting will never be able to do that again
9285798 we are suing the federal government recognising that the endangered species act is not a place to kind of mess around with listing as threatened a species that right now is very very healthy our fear being that extreme environmentalists will use this tool to eventually curtail or halt north slope production of very rich resources that america needs
9285799 i cant claim a bill clinton and say that i never inhaled
9285800 i am as pro life as any candidate can be i have adamantly supported our cause since i first understood as a child the atrocity of it
9285801 congratulations governor palin we look forward to a spirited race
9285802 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9285803 governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9285804 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9285805 story 2 is the hot air post i was looking for
9285806 we have to make sure we do x and dont do y we struggled in the past with w so we have to make sure we compensate for that
9285807 it was definitely an honor to win the stanford st jude championship last year not only because of the talented field i competed against but because of the special place this tournament holds in this communitys heart and the wonderful charity it benefits
9285808 i look forward to returning to memphis in two months to defend my title
9285809 celebrating our 51st year in memphis the stanford st jude championship has a very rich history
9285810 it is the strong support of the community as well as the commitment from dedicated sponsors such as stanford financial group and fedex that make it one of the longest running tournaments on the pga tour were excited with the way this years field is shaping up and were looking forward to entertaining our fans with another first class tournament
9285811 when love is what you seek let the eyes speak and look amongst those that let the ground sweep beneath their feet
9285812 a horse knows of no lies the truth lies just behind those gentle eyes
9285813 we believe the iphone is a great device for both personal and business use and we are dedicated to providing iphone users with mobile support to match iphones enterprise class capabilities
9285814 were demonstrating our commitment to the apple community by enabling zimbra mobile with the best iphone enterprise support
9285815 were very excited that zimbra is leveraging apples support for over the air sync on any iphone or ipod touch with 2 0 software
9285816 the iphone and ipod touch are sure to be very popular among students faculty and staff and we look forward to rolling out zimbra mobile capabilities to iphone and ipod touch users across campus
9285817 we are delighted to welcome such an experienced and well respected analyst to juniper andrew brings important skills and knowledge to the team and will play a key leadership role in our future plans
9285818 this ruling is an important victory for the safety of our families and communities we should not make it easier for dangerous domestic violence abusers to obtain dangerous firearms
9285819 todays decision means that california can get back to enforcing indispensable clean water standards that protect people from getting sick at local beaches and wildlife from toxicity in local waterways these standards protect drinking water supplies people at the beach and fish in our rivers so this is great news for everyone in southern california
9285820 although we respectfully disagree with the courts ruling that the water board violated the law heal the bay is ecstatic with the decision yesterday which restores the water quality standards that we need to protect public health and aquatic life from storm water pollution
9285821 we welcome this decision and call on the building groups and anti environmental coalition of cities who filed this case to stop spending public money to make local waters dirtier this case is an attempt to hold the interests of the public at large hostage to the anti regulatory politics of the few and its a shameful perversion of sound public policy
9285822 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country
9285823 i was fortunate to be in mile high stadium last night to watch and listen to sen obamas historic speech as he accepted the democratic nomination for president of the united states
9285824 it was very significant that sen obama directly addressed the gun violence issue in our country he decided to strike a balance between rights and responsibilities and showed how we can have common sense gun laws in america to protect our families and communities
9285825 the reality of gun ownership may be different for hunters in rural ohio than they are for those plagued by gang violence in cleveland but dont tell me we cant uphold the second amendment while keeping out of the hands of criminals
9285826 since the supreme court issued its opinion on the meaning of the second amendment the debate over gun laws in america has moved to the middle ground now common sense gun laws that save lives and protect police can be debated on their merits
9285827 america wants sensible restrictions on the easy access to dangerous weapons and sen obama clearly recognized that last night
9285828 my friends and fellow americans i am very pleased and privileged to introduce to you the next vice president of the united states governor sarah palin of the great state of alaska
9285829 it was senator mccain who refused to hedge his support for our troops in iraq regardless of the political costs and you know now as the mother of one of those troops and as the commander of alaskas national guard thats the kind of man i want as commander in chief
9285830 among those 675 monks 405 were from drepung 205 were from sera and eight were from ganden
9285831 they were transported to a military detention center in golmud
9285832 all the monks who came originally from the qinghai region were then deported to their respective towns they are still detained there in their hometown prisons or detention centers
9285833 on april 10 in the afternoon security forces detained 550 monks from drepung monastery took them to the nyethang military school and detained them on the school campus
9285834 then on the night of april 14 a huge contingent of chinese security forces arrived at sera monastery and took away about 400 monks and detained them at a military prison in tsal gungthang
9285835 on april 17 a group of monks from ganden was also rounded up and detained somewhere in lhasa
9285836 twenty four monks from drepung and sera monasteries remain in detention at the nationalities middle school in the marpa subdivision of rebgong in qinghai province where they have been held since july 25 after being moved from lhasa in april the source said
9285837 recently they were found detained in a house close to the sogpo county center
9285838 they had not been put into prisons but were under some kind of house arrest later we learned that they had been taken into detention in golmud in april
9285839 they are not allowed to leave but their family members and relatives can see them at the house where they are being held
9285840 there were about 30 to 40 monks studying in lhasa who had come from different monasteries in gepasumdo in chinese tongde county
9285841 there were 20 monks from tsang monastery alone who were studying at sera we were told that all of them were detained
9285842 as you know he was from kirti monastery in aba in tibetan ngaba prefecture in sichuan but was at sera monastery in lhasa at the time of the march protests
9285843 have colleges that are specifically designed and have been for centuries to accommodate people from those areas
9285844 some people have said that this was quite definitely the case and some people have said that this was also true of the sera and drepung demonstrations on the other two days
9285845 i dont know how strong the evidence is for that
9285846 i picked the design cuz i thought it was cool elegant and edgy
9285847 among the many mysteries surrounding autoimmune diseases is why they can sometimes take decades to manifest themselves
9285848 our findings hint that this delayed onset could be explained by subtle defects in the molecular controls on t cells
9285849 the itams we studied are little molecular tags inside the cell by which the t cell receptor communicates to the rest of the cell
9285850 the mystery we wanted to address was why the t cell receptor needs 10 itams to do its job why not just have a simple on off switch
9285851 we theorized that there were two possibilities why the immune system needs so many itams
9285852 one is that the requirement was purely quantitative and that the itams were there for signal amplification the second possibility is that different itams do slightly different things they do have slightly different structures so maybe they bind to some signaling molecules better than others and their positions in the t cell receptor are different so while our primary observation is that quantity is more important than itam type we also found that type has some influence
9285853 one implication of our findings is that a relatively small defect in the efficiency of signal transduction through the t cell receptor could give rise to a subtle failing in negative selection which gives rise over a long period of time to a few overly active t cells that might initiate autoimmunity
9285854 clearly from our studies there is the possibility that you dont really need a very big reduction in t cell receptor signal strength to have a defect in negative selection
9285855 we were surprised to find that many itams were required to make t cells divide and expand but only one or two was required to make t cells secrete cytokines
9285856 we believe this idea that t cell signaling acts more like a rheostat than an on off switch offers significant new insights into how t cell development and function is controlled
9285857 these findings are important because while genes that cause hpe have been identified the interactions among those that produce hpe are not only complex but poorly understood
9285858 this represents a first step in understanding the mechanism of that interaction
9285859 this is good evidence for what has been called the multi hit model of hpe
9285860 in this model it takes mutations in both six3 and other genes in the sonic hedgehog pathway to produce the severe pathology of hpe
9285861 sonic hedgehog is a major player in embryonic development in the brain as well as elsewhere in the body
9285862 so this new understanding of its regulation in this very limited time and place in the brain helps us understand at a molecular level some of its overall role in brain formation

9285869 target presents varietys power of youth campaign is a powerful one one that harnesses the energy of more than 150 young performers who are in a position to influence their peers and fans with the support of target and our other sponsors the power of youth effort has the opportunity to generate millions of dollars to benefit st jude childrens research hospital and create a bedrock of social awareness within the next generation of entertainment
9285870 our partnership educates and encourages young individuals to take action in their community
9285871 this event is important to target because of our long standing relationship with st jude childrens research hospital and the meaningful work they do
9285872 my father opened the doors of st jude through the generosity of the entertainment community
9285873 target and variety continue the tradition of entertainers giving back to people in need the dedication and enthusiasm of young hollywood and partners like variety and target enables us to carry on my fathers vision that no child should die in the dawn of life
9285874 bob bare epitomizes the commitment we all have for this great cause
9285875 we will do whatever we can to save these children
9285876 our findings show that children under 3 years with dpg can potentially respond better to treatment than older children
9285877 unlike other previous studies in young children where the diagnosis of dpg was based on either ct scans or magnetic resonance imaging mri the diagnosis of all our patients was based on mri only ct scans are not able to differentiate between dpg a tumor that occurs in the brainstem and other tumors which originate in the same area with a better prognosis
9285878 we believe that the more we learn about dpgs the more likely we will be able to design more effective treatments for children of all ages with this tumor

9285885 pat buchanan brought his conservative message of a smaller government and an america first foreign policy to fairbanks and wasilla on friday as he continued a campaign swing through alaska buchanans strong message championing states rights resonated with the roughly 85 people gathered for an interior republican luncheon in fairbanks among those sporting buchanan buttons were wasilla mayor sarah palin and state sen jerry ward r anchorage
9285886 i obviously disagree with biden on a host of economic and regulatory issues too though he does seem to be fairly decent on free trade but thats to be expected my problem with biden is that hes not even good on the issues the left is supposed to be good on
9285887 this album is not only a supergroup effort of the best kind but a masterclass in instrumental music take funkadelic alums bernie worrell and bootsy collins add primus drummer brain and sprinkle the mad genius of renegade guitar god buckethead and bake it in the bill laswell low end bake oven and youve got a thrashjazzfunkmetalscratch masterpiece almost good enough for the whole family
9285888 i think the american people will vote obama in because he is not yet the man that he is going to become and mccain is no longer the man that he once was
9285889 it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon him
9285890 the biggest problem confronting the world today is the illusion that our differences matter more than our common humanity
9285891 other than telling us how to live think marry pray vote invest educate our children and now die i think the republicans have done a fine job of getting government out of our personal lives

9285893 indias prime minister dr manmohan singh has launched an investigation into the arrest of hopegivers international president dr samuel thomas our letter writing campaign is working says hopegivers executive director michael glenn we must continue to write and fax letters of protest this week glenn said that because of the campaign the prime minister of india has today appointed a four member commission to investigate the persecution in kota where our president and top administrative staff have been falsely accused and jailed this is simply a naked effort to force emmanuel to shut its doors
9285894 which deal with deliberately outraging religious feelings or insulting the religious beliefs of another community
9285895 nothing that my husband has done was intended to outrage or insult any other religion this is a totally false charge and unrelated to the organised violence threats and attacks that have been conducted against us for the last six weeks
9285896 revoked without due process or hearing all the operating licenses of the hopegivers supported bookstores churches the hospital and leprosy or hiv aids outreaches orphanages printing presses schools and other institutions
9285897 of course none of these actions are legal the terrorists and hate groups have taken the law into their own hands and sadly we have lost confidence in the local government to control them
9285898 hindu gods and goddesses are fictitious and were invented to persecute dalits
9285899 to prevent indigenous people from acquiring knowledge saraswati invented difficult vedas which nobody can understand
9285900 with the progression of time people all over the world except india were freed of their ignorance and they began to disown wicked and cruel gods and goddesses but in india because people are enveloped in the darkness of ignorance imaginary gods and goddesses are still worshipped
9285901 naked sanyasis are worshipped by hindu women the moment hindu women see naked sanyasis they fall on the ground and prostrate themselves before the sanyasis hindu women pour water on the sanyasis penises and then happily drink that water ling devata is gratified when he sees all these repulsive things and feels empowered these people are ignorant and do not know the difference between what is right and wrong
9285902 sita was abandoned in the forest as per rams wishes ram later asked lakshman to kill sita in the end ram frustrated with life drowned himself in saryu such are the teachings of half naked rishis who are praised by hindutvawadis
9285903 lord shiva to get people to worship him dropped his penis on earth devi shaking the ground and the sky poor dharti devi was shaken by the weight of his penis seeing this all the gods were scared it seems gods would use their penises as bombs whenever and wherever they wanted to they would drop their penis bombs to terrorise the people thus they were able to enslave the people but compared to foreign bombs these penis bombs were a damp squib
9285904 ramakrishna paramahansa should have known that ganga is the worlds filthiest and dirtiest river how many dead bodies float down this river every day how many half burnt dead bodies are dumped into it every day and hindus call it the holy river in fact all the rivers of india are dirty and polluted hindutvawadis pollute the rivers and then depend on their false gods to cleanse them
9285905 for hindus men can be gods women can be goddesses animals are gods snakes are gods they hindu gods fight among themselves marry among themselves throw out their wives run away with others wives they steal get intoxicated drink blood are reincarnated as animals fish and tortoise some of them can lift mountains some gods are in same sex relationships and are yet able to produce babies these gods and goddesses are always armed because they believe in killing and plunder some gods think their penises are more powerful than nuclear bombs others like animals live naked among their followers some of them spend their time in yogic exercises others are in samadhi and happy to see the number of blind followers swell you can wash away your sins by worshipping the penises of gods
9285906 how could arya hindus bring aryanisation on this earth to be arya one has to be born of an arya womb if arya hindus want to bring aryanisation then they must lend or rent out all arya wombs to non aryans non aryans should be given brahmin women so that children are born from brahmin womb
9285907 in modern india many ramas of this belief are living a carefree life they marry several times desert their wives marry several times and leave them many ramas kill their sitas they are following their god rama
9285908 lord krishna had a despicable sex life shri krishna is famous because of his love life he had 16 008 wives and all yadav women were his illegitimate lovers hindu women are drawn towards him because of pornographic and vulgar tales of his sex life
9285909 communal tensions due to alleged conversion reconversions in recent years the issue of conversion re conversion has also become a major cause of communal tensions in some parts of the country allegations of forced conversions reconversions and subsequent communal tensions have surfaced from time to time on many occasions even apprehensions not founded on facts on this account have given rise to communal tensions cases in point are the recent events on the occasion of the annual religious assembly of the emmanuel bible institute samiti at kota rajasthan in february 2005 the situation was controlled due to prompt measures taken by the district states of arunachal pradesh orissa madhya pradesh and gujarat have already passed legislations to regulate conversions by coercive means or offering allurements
9285910 the constitution guarantees christian missionaries the right to convert people to christianity
9285911 violation of rights enshrined in the constitution will destroy democracy
9285912 subject to public order morality and health and to other provisions of this part all persons are equally entitled to freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess practice and propagate religion
9285913 see the constitution gives christian missionaries the right to propagate their religion
9285914 what article 25 1 grants is not the right to convert another person to ones own religion by exposition of its tenets
9285915 prohibiting conversion from one religion to another in a manner reprehensible to the

9285923 their time will come like every other evil persons time will come
9285924 then people can see people without hands people can see in public heads rolling down the street people got sic their hands and feet from opposite sides chopped off and they see them crucified they see people put up against the pole and see them get lashed in public they see it and because they see it it acts as a deterrent for them because they say i dont want that to happen to me
9285925 with the selection of senator joe biden as senator obamas vice president the democrats ticket has now become an even greater gamble for the jewish community throughout his career senator biden has consistently been wrong on iran and his voting record on israel has been inconsistent like obama biden fundamentally misunderstands the threat posed by an iran determined to obtain nuclear weapons biden has continuously demonstrated poor judgment on iran he has voted against significant legislation that would pressure iran to stop pursuing nuclear weapons biden has failed to recognize the serious threat that iran poses to israel and the us and its allies in the middle east
9285926 iran is not a nuclear threat to the united states of america
9285927 the jewish community was already gravely concerned with senator obamas na ve understanding of the iranian threat an obama biden ticket has proven that it is ill equipped to deal with this threat by selecting senator biden to join his ticket voting for senator obama has now become an even greater risk
9285928 lindsay lohan reaches plea deal will serve one day in jail i relapsed actress says
9285929 first i want to apologize for all the things that ive done and that i have allowed to happen
9285930 i was not honest and forthright in our discussions and you know i was ashamed and totally disappointed in myself to say the least
9285931 but when he said it was a very immature thing i found that very interesting because he was talking about being a role model to children
9285932 how we choose our words is a very interesting dynamic in how our apology will be heard and how sincere we come across
9285933 even though he didnt seem to be really admitting his actions in full were terrible i think people wanted to hear that there was a recognition that he did something wrong
9285934 first please let me apologize to my family friends staff and fellow idahoans for the cloud placed over idaho
9285935 i did nothing wrong at the minneapolis airport i regret my decision to plead guilty and the sadness that decision has brought to my wife family friends staff and fellow idahoans for that i apologize
9285936 i chose to plead guilty to a lesser charge in the hope of making it go away
9285937 its not an apology in my view unless you take ownership of it
9285938 you have to be sincere admit it and apologize for it and ask for forgiveness
9285939 but an apology is more than words its demonstrated by actions i can say im sorry and go out and do the same darn thing again
9285940 good name was dragged through the mud for political reasons
9285941 i think this makes sense basically because microsoft has to do something different to increase market share in the overall it market
9285942 they have to do something disruptive and eye catching and this speaks to their marketing positioning and future expansion plans
9285943 a rim deal would be larger by an order of magnitude
9285944 i just dont see microsoft making that size of acquisition

9285947 during the quarter the company ran a higher than normal product backlog driven by better than expected demand for the new inspiron and xps color notebooks coupled with supply constraints for several colors and a tightening in supply of certain flat panel displays
9285948 dell had been the leader in handling the supply chain but its been leapfrogged by hp in the consumer market and lenovo has made some major advances as well on the enterprise side
9285949 everyone tries to play it very close in terms of the supply chain
9285950 they dont want any excess in there but if there are any snags at all it causes problems
9285951 it is part of the human condition that as we get older we find that things that we once valued

9285963 theyll take the clean stuff and the not so clean stuff as well
9285964 not only does she stand for energy independence and opening up different sources her background also helps republicans make the case that expanding drilling could also help create jobs
9285965 mccains challenge overall on economic issues will be to convince core republican voters that hell continue to represent traditional positions of lower taxes and less government while also reaching out to swing voters and convincing them he can make america a land of opportunity again
9285966 mccain will need to paint obama as a big government guy who will take money out of your wallet while using the convention to argue that he himself is a proven leader who has gotten things done
9285967 john mccain likes to say that hell follow bin laden to the gates of hell but he wont even follow him to the cave where he lives

9285979 one often heard especially from priests that one cannot live on nothing but presently these priests manage to do just that christianity does not exist and yet they live on it
9285980 are of no use to us today to understand the universe we live in people who are educated in these religious scraps are unfit to be citizens of any country he says and this was more true of christianity he opines he says the bible education makes you unfit for life sartre

9285982 what constitutes a nation is not spea king the same tongue or belonging to the same religion or ethnic group but having accomplished great things in common in the past and the wish to accomplish them again in future

9285984 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life the fact that mccain would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9285985 heres a governor who may have served two years but her accomplishments are worth eight shes got as much experience for being vice president as barack does to be president
9285986 if elected vice president palin would appear to have the least amount of experience in federal office or as a governor since john w kern democrat william jennings bryans 1908 running mate who had served for four years in the indiana state senate and then four more as city solicitor of indianapolis
9285987 this is not a story about scholars questioning governor palins credentials so much as partisan democrats who would find a reason to disqualify or discount any nominee put forward by senator mccain

9285991 in the new survey 35 of voters say the selection of palin makes them more likely to vote for mccain while 33 say they are less likely to do so most republicans say they are more likely to vote for palin and most democrats say the opposite as for voters not affiliated with either major party 37 are more likely to vote for mccain and 28 less likely to do so those numbers are a bit more positive than initial reaction to biden
9285992 manmohan singhs reputation for personal honesty was the last remaining asset of the congress after four years of government the voter did not ever believe his ministers to be clean after the cash for votes and hide the tape scandal manmohan singh is just another sullied politician willing to feast on grub street in the company of the most famous bagmen and travel the gravy train chatting with fixers and pushers in order to remain in office
9285993 as a result of inordinate delays in disposal of cases and poor rate of conviction crimes had become a profitable business the people do not trust the system any more
9285994 there lived in an old busy city a lonely young man who was called john he grew sad because of his loneliness and in a desperate bid to escape his sorrow he ended up in love with a woman called sally or something who professed to love him also

9285998 ra 9504 clearly states that workers who are receiving a compensation income not more than the statutory wage fixed by the regional tripartite wage and productivity board are considered minimum wage earners and are therefore entitled to exemption from paying income tax
9285999 this runs in contrast to what the draft implementing regulations stipulates as the latter creates its own qualifications of who should be covered by the tax exemption package consequently redefining who a minimum wage earner is
9286000 the proposed regulations also violate a previous supreme court decision in the umali v estanislao case which ruled that increased tax exemptions should cover compensation income earned for the entire year
9286001 we dont understand why the bir and the dof have to complicate the rules for implementing the tax exemption law
9286002 instead of providing relief the draft regulations impose undue burden to employees and employers alike this is particularly true for the public sector which is already reeling from loads of administrative work
9286003 the administration could very well offset their loss in revenue from the workers income taxes if only it would stamp out corruption that drains away much needed resources that could have otherwise gone for public services

9286015 sure self feeding is great for sensory experiences gaining confidence with different tastes and textures building hand coordination amp most importantly nutrition but sometimes its just fun to squish the little pieces of food in your hands

9286017 progress comes easily for a community where people are educated and well informed in recognizing this vital factor the military makes it its goal to help bring education especially in far flung communities investing in education is the key to peace and development which is a long term solution
9286018 the military with its humanitarian activities is confident that the problem on peace and order will be solved development is the best key weapon in the pursuit of peace and progress in sulu
9286019 thank you for carrying the burden with me in improving the lives of my people through initiating peace programs and providing assistance in development projects peace and order in sulu is getting better everyday
9286020 with these development undertakings the image of sulu is slowly changing from chaotic to peaceful to a progressive place for everyone
9286021 operation kandili preserving a unique culture through providing homes for the badjao
9286022 we have been funding and implementing a lot of projects in sulu and all these are part of our peace and development programs we want a culture of peace and this can be achieved through education and basic infrastructure projects and with the participation of course of the people themselves
9286023 sulu is more stable more developed and relatively safe now compared last 2002 when i first arrived despite travel warnings advising travelers to avoid sulu archipelago where accordingly there are ethnic and religious animosities
9286024 when i first made the journey to sulu ethnological museum at notre dame college the provincial capitol with a moor inspired architecture the masjid jami the largest of the towns mosques and the barter trade market i was caught in a pleasant surprise by their exquisiteness and culture bud datu a 200 meters high hill outside jolo is the site of the revered tomb of a muslim missionary from abroad the town and sea below may be seen from a nearby military camp
9286025 likewise the island is rich with white beaches having crystal clear water and lush green mountains such as the kilometer long white sand maubo beach in patikul the next town to jolo but the province is more known for its excellent diving spots the best of which is tubbataha reef
9286026 i know many would raise their eyebrows with this because sulu has a reputation for being chaotic well its really something of an image problem which is exaggerated but if you come down here and feel sulu for yourself youll know what i mean
9286027 i admit before my first visit to sulu i told myself that such place portrayed by media as a
9286028 now that the military has the peoples support especially because of its security measures and humanitarian offensives and the provincial government has ambitious and beautiful vision for the province the more optimism there is in solving the problems on both terrorism and poverty seeing concrete evidences i now have a totally different outlook

9286042 almost half of the journalists reported they were not familiar with the concept of health literacy but said that their readers ability to understand health information was very important to consider when writing health stories
9286043 increasing knowledge of health literacy could help journalists clarify medical information to readers
9286044 health journalists play an important role in helping people effectively manage their health
9286045 however we found that many journalists find it difficult to explain health information to their readers while maintaining the informations scientific credibility they have to resist bogging down the story with too much technical science data and dumbing down the story with overly simplistic recommendations

9286052 what independent variable accounts for americas continued support for israel
9286053 present as complete and undistorted a picture as is possible
9286054 israel is the only stable democracy we can rely on in a spot where armageddon could come
9286055 so pervasive at the white house as well as in congress that it is impossible to ascertain where lobby pressure ends and independent presidential thinking begins
9286056 certain actions are known to be anathema to the pro israel lobby and so they do not even enter into policy considerations lobby pressures are an inextricable part of presidential strategy
9286057 the reagan administration has elevated aipac to the level of a player in this game
9286058 stands out as the only president who ever exerted heavy pressure on the jewish state for a territorial withdrawal
9286059 militarily purposeless and hopelessly unstable without an arab israeli peace

9286061 expulsion of more than 750 000 palestinians from what became israel in 1948
9286062 the deliberate use of artillery and snipers against the civilian populations of the big cities
9286063 the forced movement of civilian populations entailing the systematic destruction of homes the looting of personal property beatings selective and random killings and massacres
9286064 large scale intimidation laying siege to and bombarding villages and population centers setting fire to homes properties and goods expelling residents demolishing homes and finally planting mines in the rubble to prevent the expelled inhabitants from returning
9286065 remains unworkable because it was flawed from the start resting on the discredited idea on which political zionism stakes all its moral authority that any ethnic group can legitimately claim permanent formal dominion over a territorial state
9286066 populations are angry with the united states over a perceived double standard regarding its long standing support for israel at the expense of palestinians

9286089 challenge the messages shes imbibing awaken her to the garbage shes consuming
9286090 ill be voting for the first time and im voting for stephen harper
9286091 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9286092 we get caribou get em ground up and put them into hot dogs theyre polish
9286093 its girl power and you know im all about that shes very smart has a sweet family her sons in the military and my brothers are in the military we have a lot in common this is my dream choice i almost started crying on stage and i am not a crier when they were talking about this being the anniversary of womens suffrage i couldnt be more proud its also a reinvention of the republican party shes such a cool role model and shes got great shoes
9286094 the four most prominent parties with representation in the house of commons
9286095 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9286096 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9286097 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9286098 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9286099 not to belittle alaska but its different than the basket of issues you deal with in big dynamic states
9286100 if she had been around for two terms as governor or been a senator it would have been an incredible choice
9286101 who else could he have found who appealed to the conservative base and as someone who was a reformer
9286102 what is it exactly that the vice president does all day
9286103 what about this team makes you think theyre going to pull this off
9286104 oh man hes going to get torn apart for this
9286105 man he looks awful just like he did when he was first called up to the big leagues they really need to have a serious talk with him or trade him
9286106 if the president thought john mccain was going to be the next president he would think it more appropriate to let the next president make that decision than do it on his way out
9286107 i do wonder with senator obama if president bush thinks senator obamas going to win does he somehow think does he worry that obama wont follow through on that policy
9286108 people are overdoing how much of a lame duck the president is
9286109 greenspan saw his job as a cheerleader for people who were able to get rich fast sort of like a pilot fish for sharks

9286117 tis a history with which more and more of us are growing quite familiar
9286118 agencies had caught on that chennault was the go between between nixon and his people and president thieu in saigon the idea was to bring things to a stop in paris and prevent any show of progress
9286119 im speaking on behalf of mr nixon its very important that our vietnamese friends understand our republican position and i hope you made that clear to them
9286120 many republican friends have contacted me and encouraged me to stand firm
9286121 the longer the present situation continues the more favorable for us i am regularly in touch with the nixon entourage
9286122 in the end though johnsons advisers decided it was too late and too potentially damaging to u s interests to uncover what had been going on
9286123 if nixon should emerge as the victor what would the chennault outrage do to his viability as an incoming president and what effect would it have on american opinion about the war
9286124 you couldnt surface it the country would be in terrible trouble
9286125 you should know that in 1980 the republicans approached me with an arms deal if i could arrange to keep the hostages in iran until after the elections
9286126 the offer to arafat was if you block the release of hostages then the white house would be open for the plo
9286127 i guess the same offer was given to others and i believe that some accepted to do it and managed to block the release of hostages
9286128 told me that if i do not accept this proposal they the republicans would make the same offer to my rivals
9286129 lastly he told me my refusal of their offer would result in my elimination
9286130 hypothetically speaking president bush advised that he would not have directed anyone to investigate the possibility that clinton had renounced his citizenship because he would have relied on others to make this decision
9286131 he bush would have said something like lets get it out or hope the truth gets out
9286132 jim baker came in here this morning about 10 30 deeply disturbed and read to me a long letter of resignation all because of this stupid passport situation
9286133 politics amp the media bridging the political divide in the 2008 elections
9286134 thought we were doing important work and having a hell of a lot of fun doing it
9286135 but you would have to agree that they do believe in what they are doing they believe they are doing the right thing
9286136 cast a very large shadow starting with syria and iran across the whole arab world
9286137 israel is acknowledging in effect that its blockade has not worked and hamas is here to stay
9286138 but its more about the election here and continuing to poke at the old russian bear
9286139 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of u s president
9286140 the fact is that us citizens were indeed in the area in conflict during the hostilities
9286141 it should be admitted that they would do so only following direct orders from their leaders
9286142 the american side in effect armed and trained the georgian army
9286143 why seek a difficult compromise solution in the peacekeeping process it is easier to arm one of the sides and provoke it into killing another side and the job is done
9286144 the suspicion arises that someone in the united states especially created this conflict with the aim of making the situation more tense and creating a competitive advantage for one of the candidates fighting for the post of us president
9286145 both sides await supreme court ruling on right to bear
9286146 if anything were to happen to a president mccain the destiny of the free world would be placed in the hands of a woman who until the day before friday was a small town mayor mr mccains supporters argue that he is more serious about national security than barack obama but the selection of sarah palin invites the question how serious can he be if he would place such a neophyte second in line to the presidency barack obama at least balanced his inexperience with mr bidens experience what is mr mccain doing
9286147 so be true to your school now just like you would to your gi rl

9286182 the next logical step was to allow people to access a similar message on their mobile phones
9286183 one technology that i think well see more of is haptics
9286184 vibration is something that our games should be using because it is such a powerful way of sending information to the player

9286192 for months the mccainiacs have said they will run on his judgment and experience
9286193 in his first presidential decision john mccain has shown that he is willing to endanger his country potentially leaving it in the hands of someone who simply has no business being a heartbeat away from the most powerful complicated difficult job in human history
9286194 americans who have opposed the iraq war and who are against another war with iran should begin to worry because a mccain lieberman ticket would be very electable
9286195 we either get hillarys voters and we win or we dont its not a mystery
9286196 and i agree with many of them if a more mainstream candidate had the same positions would you support him
9286197 well id like to reserve judgment until all the facts are in
9286198 russian aggression is a load of crap and the majority of the world knows it and feels it the madness is plain to see and these idiots are hunting for a war with russia and it is so obvious
9286199 for while senator mccain was turning his sights to iraq just days after 9 11 i stood up and opposed this war knowing that it would distract us from the real threats we face
9286200 the fact of the matter is al qaida and the taliban the people who have actually attacked us on 9 11 note exactly the same wording as in the obama speech theyve regrouped in the mountains between afghanistan and pakistan and are plotting new attacks and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff has echoed baracks call for more troops and john mccain was wrong and barack obama was right
9286201 to cover war costs into the early months of a new administration those amounts combined would represent the highest level of military spending since the end of world war ii adjusted for inflation
9286202 m ore resources and more troops to finish the fight against the terrorists who actually attacked us on 9 11
9286203 now is the time to finally meet our moral obligation to provide every child a world class education ill invest in early childhood education ill recruit an army of new teachers and pay them higher salaries and give them more support
9286204 lockheed martin strongly supports our nations political process and candidates that support in general national defense homeland security high technology and educational initiatives
9286205 i will end this war in iraq responsibly and finish the fight against al qaeda and the taliban in afghanistan i will rebuild our military to meet future conflicts but i will also renew the tough direct diplomacy that can prevent iran from obtaining nuclear weapons and curb russian aggression i will build new partnerships to defeat the threats of the 21st century terrorism and nuclear proliferation poverty and genocide climate change and disease and i will restore our moral standing so that america is once again that last best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom who long for lives of peace and who yearn for a better future these are the policies i will pursue and in the weeks ahead i look forward to debating them with john mccain
9286206 to present a different face to the world that could revive illusions in its democratic pretensions not only internationally but within the united states as well
9286207 he obama is saying that as soon as he takes office that we have to have a very serious set of negotiations with the iranians in which we in effect present them with a choice
9286208 this is an extremely important issue an extremely serious issue and an extremely urgent issue
9286209 we had a deal this isnt the way it was supposed to happen
9286210 god you told me that id see my childrens children grown that id have a mansion and that id die in a warm place
9286211 what if we finally got the candidate this great nation deserves

9286213 players use the ds particularly often for brain training exercises
9286214 when youve got a community as big as ours theres a need to uphold a mutually agreeable value system
9286215 with our new justice system our community now has a self ruling mechanism that can grow and evolve at its own pace
9286216 do ya spose that the heaths are an outdoorsy family
9286217 can i yes i can that is what we set out to achieve in mercenaries 2 and i am proud to say that is what we are delivering
9286218 with mercenaries 2 we are bringing our signature style to a truly epic fun experience with tons of weapons airstrikes and vehicles wrapping it all up in a virtual venezuela that should provide endless larger than life moments
9286219 and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9286220 therefore brothers since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of jesus by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through his flesh and since we have a great priest over the house of god let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water
9286221 let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works
9286222 the american people will never have a better government than they deserve
9286223 it is better to light a candle than to curse the darkness

9286228 so youre pretty much awesome and i want to say
9286229 today john mccain put the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency governor palin shares john mccains commitment to overturning roe v wade the agenda of big oil and continuing george bushs failed economic policies thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9286230 i think that uh you know campaigns start getting these uh hair triggers and uh the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9286231 wants to take the country in the wrong direction im assuming gov palin agrees with him and his policies
9286232 thats not the change we need its just more of the same
9286233 its not even really a metaphor for slavery slavery is whats going on
9286234 i would truthfully say that angola prison is a sophisticated plantation

9286236 allows inmates to be trained in work habits and allows them to develop marketable skills in the areas of farming animal husbandry vegetable meat and milk processing
9286237 the warden says it takes good food good medicine good prayin and good playin to have a good prison
9286238 in the conventional plantations slaves were given just enough food clothing and shelter to be a financial asset to the owner the same is true for the louisiana prison system
9286239 prisoners worked out in the field sometimes 17 hours straight rain or shine
9286240 theyd tell you the officer was always right no matter what
9286241 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states
9286242 prisoners can be forced to work for the government against their will and this is true in every state
9286243 i would have more faith in that amendment if it werent so clear that our criminal justice system is racially biased in a really obvious way
9286244 i dont have any illusions that this is a simple process
9286245 many people are apathetic about what happens in prisons it would be very difficult but i would not suggest it would be impossible
9286246 many black inmates viewed farm work under these circumstances as too close to slavery to want to participate
9286247 theyve got a lot of land to bury a lot of prisoners
9286248 but if you are white in america and you dont reek of weed or alcohol a random traffic stop isnt going to land you in the slammer

9286254 i cant say enough about all the support we have with skyjacker herculiner and goodyear the propower engine got me to the corner first and royal purple oil kept everything running cool the raybestos brakes kept this hot rod in control at every corner thanks to fox racing shox for all their support last year we built this truck and were getting it dialed in when i broke my foot at bark river then dan vanden heuvel came and drove this truck to victory in wheatland and now i won today really this is the second win for our team my team is just awesome we have campaigned two trucks all year we got off to a slow start but my guys kept making progress now we are world champs i love this track but have never won on saturday thanks to the world series the forest county potawatomi and lucas oil for creating the series the great folks at crandon for building an awesome place to race thanks to my wife my dad all of my family and friends that have supported us through the years i cant wait for the cup race tomorrow
9286255 i think especially for the 68 car its a huge feat because weve kind of had some bad luck
9286256 weve had some silly mistakes that shouldnt have happened and it was nobodys fault they just happened days like today show that all the work is worth it it makes everybody like rj valentine trg owner kevin buckler and the crew happy and especially our sponsors from f1 boston to crg to colliers international it really makes everybodys involvement worthwhile im glad we could finally show what the 68 car is capable of it makes me feel good to be a part of it
9286257 rj has a long history of mentoring and helping young drivers and hes continuing that tradition this weekend by supporting trg koni challenge series driver scott schroeders new sponsor colliers international in the rolex series race
9286258 its just tough but i felt like i did decent bryan sellers is on pole and i was the second quickest trg car which is great because i wasnt running the best of all the other trg cars throughout the practice so i stepped it up here in qualifying i learned a couple little tricks from following some guys around and i feel like we have a decent car for the race
9286259 i was getting pretty aggressive there in the beginning and put in a decent lap i was really pushing on the next lap and ended up going off which is disappointing but well have an okay starting position well have to work our way up through the field i think spencer and i are up for it
9286260 i went a little bit faster than this morning and im getting faster all the time i made a couple mistakes did a few things right and hopefully ill learn from them and be a little faster for tomorrow
9286261 racing doesnt mean much when one of your buddies goes through something like that were all praying hes going to be okay
9286262 i think we all kind of went up there friday with a conservative mindset just to get a feel for the racetrack
9286263 once we got an idea of what it would hold we were able to tune from there and thats why you saw so many people step it up in round 2
9286264 our car responded very well to the changes we made and we ran about what we expected in that session i think we would have seen a bunch of guys go into the fives tonight but it just wasnt meant to be
9286265 we ran really well right out of the trailer so we had the luxury of trying to take a home run swing up there
9286266 to be realistic id have rather done what we did than gone out there and run mediocre we werent going to learn anything from it so the hope is we look at the numbers and look at the computer and well be better on night sessions in the future
9286267 we started this weekend off great by making a strong run friday night first session
9286268 and we really wanted to run a little quicker than a 14 tonight but were quite happy with it right now we need to focus on the showdown
9286269 we hopped it up to try to run a really good number
9286270 and it broke a valve spring retainer then put a cylinder out at the hit of the throttle and it banged the supercharger down track unfortunately after all the changes we made we didn t learn anything so we hope we can kick this thing up in the sunlight tomorrow
9286271 the upside is that tonight was the hero session when you can make a great run but its not the conditions that we will be racing in on monday it would have been nice to get in the top 12 because we probably would have been pretty much guaranteed to be in the show on monday
9286272 but those were not the conditions were going to race in and we went down the track today in the heat so i think well be all right for tomorrow
9286273 it feels great to start the u s nationals out on top
9286274 the combination of the great track condition and the power we were getting out of this car contributed to this smooth run
9286275 we were a little nervous since this was the first race in this car since houston but i am very happy with the way it performed i need to thank roger burgess and r2b2 for giving me the great opportunity to come out and compete
9286276 ts proving to be a tough rally for us so far but we must approach it with an overall perspective and not just seize on one element of the mix
9286277 its important that we work systematically to enable us to build on our experience here and continue to improve our new car
9286278 the car was a lot better than yesterday but its been another tough day
9286279 a lot of the stages were very narrow and when you struggle for confidence it really shows in the times we made some adjustments to the dampers for the last stage and it wasnt bad but we still have more work to do im just driving saying what i feel and letting the engineers work on the car and come up with the ideas were just lacking overall grip here thats what we need to find on the fast and flat stuff like the last stage we re not bad but on the twisty its very difficult to push and thats where we re losing time
9286280 this afternoon was better and we were able to push for some better times
9286281 but overall today has not been good we had some problems with the suspension struts that meant the car wasnt damping properly but after we changed them in service it was better weve still got a lot to learn with this new car and its frustrating that were in this position as from testing we know this car can perform far better the guys did a great job on the car last night to turn it round in time and id like to thank them all
9286282 we started this weekend with a completely different set up compared to the last race in brno two weeks ago but it worked straight away and i was consistently fast from the first practice session we tried to further improve things this afternoon with different springs for the front fork but it seems that the bike steered a little easier before so we might go back to our previous set up for the race i just missed out on a front row start by a fraction of a second which is a pity but i still feel confident for the race i hope to get a good start because my aim is to hang on to the front group of riders and to stop anybody from getting away
9286283 we worked very well today and managed to fine tune our set up my aim was to cut the gap to the fastest guys with a really strong final run in qualifying then i ran into traffic and got held up by another rider in the last section of the track which spoiled my lap time but were running at a good pace were well prepared for the race tomorrow my team is doing an excellent job and we really want to go out and do well in the race
9286284 we knew we wouldnt be able to get anything more out of the old chassis than we had managed in recent races sp we took the risk and tried a completely new chassis for this race there are definitely a lot of positive aspects about this frame but there are also some negative things that we still need to sort out the good thing is that the new bike is easier to handle and faster in direction changes but the overall grip level on front and rear seems to be a little bit lower thats our main problem at the moment if you dont get enough feedback and a complete feeling of confidence from your tyres its difficult to push now we have to decide whether to continue with the new chassis tomorrow or go back to the old bike
9286285 the improvements with mikas new chassis are clearly visible in some of the corners but its also a fact that were still struggling in some other areas we are a little bit down on engine power at the moment we have a smaller air box with the new chassis and were still working on a new fuel tank design to compensate for that it was mikas decision to take the risk and try out the new chassis in a race this early thats completely understandable because he wants to pull all stops in our hunt for the world title its now up to us to find the set up solutions that will enable him to be fully competitive in the race tomorrow
9286286 we were a little bit down on engine power in the heat today but other than that everything went according to plan we managed to steadily improve our set up and i feel good and comfortable on the bike im really looking forward to the race tomorrow
9286287 we suffered a bit with the heat today the water temperature rose much higher than it should have but theres nothing to worry about because well be able to adjust our cooling system to the summer heat for the race tomorrow our chassis set up is so good that we hardly make any changes from one race to the next were also sure about tyre choice and that our tyres will last race distance im confident for the race tomorrow and hope for a good position in the top ten
9286288 ive never been on this race track before and i managed to steadily improve from the first practice to final qualifying so im quite happy with my position on the grid im also getting used to riding with the worlds best and it doesnt make me nervous any more i treat it just as another race and i am having lots of fun my aim is to make it to the chequered flag tomorrow
9286289 we had a good morning and seemed to be going the right direction with the set up for this afternoons final qualifying
9286290 i m extremely pleased about timo s scheider pole position which he clinched with a superb performance the team and he have shown their outstanding form yet again you can t wish for a better starting position than the one at the very front of the grid on this narrow circuit
9286291 this is a perfect day for me today i was facing this weekend with a certain amount of awe because i didn t get along with the track here at brands hatch terribly well in the past two years so now i m even happier about having clinched my fourth pole this year on this particular circuit grid positions mean a lot at brands hatch because overtaking is difficult in other words we ve got ideal prerequisites for the race
9286292 the team result wasn t the way we d expected it to be at least we clinched pole after a strong showing by timo i m starting in the middle of several mercedes drivers unfortunately mattias lost out somewhat still last year i recovered from eleventh to second place so there s still quite a bit of potential for sunday
9286293 of course i m extremely satisfied with grid position six this morning things weren t going perfectly for us yet but for the qualifying we got it all right on the dot i d like to thank and congratulate the team
9286294 my a4 would have definitely been good enough for a place on the first two rows of the grid today but at the end of the second qualifying session i had gearbox problems and wasn t able to shift into third anymore i went out anyhow and fought as best i could but with only five gears seventh place was the best i could do now i ve got an 82 lap recovery ahead of me tomorrow
9286295 i was just lacking one hundredth to make it into the final qualifying that s why i m not completely satisfied even though my time is actually good the qualifying was chaotic due to the excursions in turn 2 i was only able to use one of my four sets of tyres now we need to try and finish the race in the points
9286296 i d really been looking forward to the qualifying because things had been going so well on friday as well as in free practice unfortunately due to the many interruptions i only had one free lap and that lap wasn t perfect actually a place among the top ten would have been possible
9286297 this was a poor qualifying for me the car was good as third place in free practice this morning showed unfortunately there were many interruptions so the track was full of traffic once it was opened again i only had one free lap and on that lap i was a bit too optimistic in turn 2
9286298 we had been hoping for tenth place but unfortunately didn t quite make it nevertheless the qualifying went well we always drove the same time which reflects the car s maximum our time of 42 7 seconds wasn t bad but not quick enough
9286299 that was a difficult qualifying it started with my setting a good time on the first laps in the second turn my right front wheel locked when i started braking and i slipped into the gravel too bad we didn t get another chance later because the car wasn t put back on the track
9286300 this was not a good qualifying for me apparently my brakes weren t hot enough when i braked into turn 2 the wheels locked unfortunately when this happens at that particular place there s no stopping the car any more too bad
9286301 very fair to middling qualifying congratulations to timo scheider he did a superb job i feel sorry for mattias because of the defect but on the whole we ve got a good starting base for the race
9286302 we look back on the qualifying with mixed emotions on the positive side of course is oliver who finishing sixth achieved a very strong result i think alex could have done similarly well because his car was very quick too unfortunately he went off the track
9286303 the qualifying was a like a game of roulette every time we went out we had a yellow period we d been hoping for more but first we had no luck in this lottery and than we were struck by misfortune on top now we need to see to it that tomorrow will be better

9286311 in britain alone experts say landfill sites could offer up an estimated 200 million tonnes of old plastic worth up to 60 billion pounds at current prices to be recovered and recycled or converted to liquid fuel
9286312 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
9286313 according to the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd the amount of household rubbish thrown out across the world is expected to rise to about 3 billion tonnes a year by 2030 from 1
9286314 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
9286315 the value of these materials varies daily with global market prices and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from china for instance
9286316 were in the field right now and thats all that matters at this point unfortunately i red lighted in the ringers gloves race but tomorrow is a new day and well just take our schumacher electric xxx racing fuels suzuki and go out there and do the best we can i think we can run a little bit better than we have so far we know theres more in it we just have to find it
9286317 im getting a lot more comfortable with the bike on each run
9286318 the schumacher electric albrechts fast track suzuki is really fast
9286319 i ran a 7 05 twice and im getting comfortable with the bike and as time goes on im going to get more and more comfortable with it hopefully we can squeeze some more elapsed time out of it tomorrow
9286320 we made quite a good start today but not as good as we could have hoped so we still have some work to do in order to close the gap to casey at the moment the main problem is t4 where i am quite slow and so we really need to look at the data and work out why anyway were still second so were close but i hope tomorrow to be closer because it seems that everyone is quite competitive here so were going to have to work hard we have some ideas and we will see what we can do its great to be racing in the sunshine so close to my home on the track which was the first one i ever rode on and i really hope we can make it a fantastic weekend for all of the fans
9286321 for the first day it hasnt been so bad and were in quite good shape its clear that there are some areas in which we can and need to improve so now we will use the information we have gathered today to work on those areas and refine our set up we have worked through a few different things today on the setting and we have also tried some different tyres and were confident that we have good potential luckily for once we can expect the same weather again tomorrow so this will give us the chance to check everything weve learnt today
9286322 this is definitely a different situation form the last two races here as expected from last years data michelin tyres are more competitive and they are giving us the chance to be back at the top end of the classification the test in brno was very important to improve the tyre situation but we still need to work more with michelin to further improve the grip level because were still not as fast as we would like to be we need to improve our set up more for this track because the front of the bike is still not stable enough on the hard braking and we need to work more on the suspension
9286323 i was really fired up this morning and it all felt pretty natural and the bike felt good the tyres seemed to work great for ten laps but when i went out on them again to check the endurance this afternoon it didnt feel as good maybe it was the temperature because it was a bit hotter this afternoon but i went out thinking it would be the same as this morning i felt like i was riding well but the pace just wasnt there as it had been this morning i rode my second bike this afternoon and while they are always supposed to be the same it is always different in some small way and it felt more rigid than this morning with the chassis so i dont know if that also might have contributed to the times just not being as fast i need to back to back the bikes tomorrow and see which one i am going to race because ive also got some small issues with wear on the rear tyre and it is similar to brno ive never really seen a wear pattern like that before so ill sit down with michelin and my guys tonight and see if we can figure something out we have still got some work to do but i feel more confident that at the last few races and ill looking to get that challenge for fourth in the championship back on track
9286324 im pretty pleased to be back in the top ten and we worked hard on the race set up only running one set of tyres through the whole session i did 23 laps on the tyres and i was still doing low and consistent 36s we have had some issues with the tyres and i really wanted to make sure we have got the endurance for the race i think if we had put a fresh set of tyres in at the end there was definitely a 35 in there so im not too worried about being in tenth because it feels like there is plenty more to come it is good because im able to do the pace quite comfortably at the last three races i have been uncomfortable on 12 or 13 corners where here its just two its a good base to start from and a big thanks to michelin we knew they had the capabilities to do it and they are working hard there is still a lot to do but at least it shows they are pushing hard i am sat here knowing that with hard work we might have an outside chance of fighting for a podium and thats what im here for at the last three rounds ive had no chance of that and ive known it on friday afternoon so i feel well up for it we need good and consistent grip to give michelin good feedback and give them a direction they want and thats what we have done today

9286335 the day has come when we can combine sensory deprevation with drug hypnosis and astute manipulation of reward and punishment to gain almost absolute control over an individuals behavior it should then be possible to achieve a very rapid and highly effective type of positive brainwashing that would allow us to make dramatic changes in a persons behavior and personality

9286338 other mind to mind induction techniques are being considered if perfected this capability could allow the direct transferrence of thought via telepathy from one mind or group of minds to a select target audience the unique factor is that the recipient will not be aware that thought has been implanted from an external source he or she will believe the thoughts are original
9286339 if it is possible to feed artificial thought into the multigenic field via satellite the mind control of the entire planet is now possible an individuals only resistance would be to constantly question the motivation behind their thoughts and not act upon thoughts which they consider to be outside their own ideological religious and moral boundaries
9286340 the information on those kinds of technologies presented here would be considered by some to be ridiculous since it does not conform to their view of reality but some people still believe the world is flat
9286341 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
9286342 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s

9286344 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
9286345 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim

9286347 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
9286348 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
9286349 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country

9286353 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
9286354 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
9286355 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
9286356 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

9286360 the new data confirm that the world will likely reach the first millennium development goal mdg of halving the 1990 level of poverty by 2015 and that poverty has fallen by about one percentage point a year since 1981
9286361 however the sobering news that poverty is more pervasive than we thought means we must redouble our efforts especially in sub saharan africa
9286362 the new estimates are a major advance in poverty measurement because they are based on far better price data for assuring that the poverty lines are comparable across countries

9286365 i think its imperative that the following step be taken the president should have already and should do so very quickly convene the presidents working group on financial markets thats something that he can ask the secretary of the treasury to do this has to be coordinated across markets with the regulators here and obviously with regulators and central banks around the world
9286366 t he banking problems in the united states continue to mount while the federal governments deficit continues to soar out of control so what happened to cause the dollar to rally over the past three weeks in a word
9286367 when central banks intervene in the currency markets they exchange their currency for dollars
9286368 on july 16 2008 the federal reserve reported holding 2 349 billion of us government paper in custody for central banks in its report released today this amount had grown over the past three weeks to 2 401 billion a 38 4 annual rate of growth so central banks were accumulating dollars over the past three weeks at a rate far above what one would expect as a result of the us trade deficit the logical conclusion is that they were intervening in currency markets they were buying dollars for the purpose of propping it up to keep the dollar from falling off the edge of the cliff and doing so ignited a short covering rally which is not too difficult to do given the leverage employed in the markets these days by hedge funds and others

9286375 we say in our platform that we believe that the right to coin money and issue money is a function of government those who are opposed to this proposition tell us that the issue of paper money is a function of the bank and that the government ought to go out of the banking business i stand with jefferson and tell them as he did that the issue of money is a function of the government and that the banks should go out of the governing business w hen we have restored the money of the constitution all other necessary reforms will be possible and until that is done there is no reform that can be accomplished
9286376 the right of the government to issue money is not surrendered to the banks the control over the money so issued is not relinquished by the government
9286377 the federal reserve board can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change either up or down
9286378 this is the strangest most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government that ever existed
9286379 some people think that the federal reserve banks are united states government institutions

9286389 palin is not to be underestimated her real strength is that she is authentic a real mom an outdoors person a small town mayor hey she has dealt with a small town city council that alone could be preparation for staring down vladimir putin right she is also a reformer
9286390 sarah palin has long been considered to be a libertarian leaning republican as mayor of wasila anchorage suburb palin was friends with local libertarian republican elected officials and worked closely with them on tax cut proposals
9286391 she is known to have spoken to two libertarian party meetings in 2004 05 she was endorsed by the libertarian party of alaska in the final days of her race for governor in 2006 even though the lp had its sic own candidate on election night ms palin at the egan center went out of her way to acknowledge the libertarian partys support in her victory speech
9286392 governor palin was not endorsed by the rlc in 2006 but is somewhat allied with libertarian republicans in alaska the rlc recently endorsed her closely allied lt governor sean parnell in his race against don pork barrel young a race in which the results are too close to call at this time

9286405 and you will hear of wars and threats of wars but dont panic yes these things must take place but the end wont follow immediately

9286424 if you keep yourself pure you will be a special utensil for honorable use your life will be clean and you will be ready for the master to use you for every good work
9286425 today i read on a blog that i went to the doctor and he said i was overweight and i cried and went to planet blue because i was blue and bought 6 pair of size 0 jeans now it is ridiculous to read such nonsense about oneself so i thought i would address this one
9286426 a news and media blog in the libertarian tenor with limited government overtones facilitating the flow of ideas information e commerce and inspiration within the internet freedom of net neutrality
9286427 my reading of history convinces me that most bad government results from too much government
9286428 commerce with all nations alliance with none should be our motto
9286429 i believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies if the american people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their currency first by inflation then by deflation the banks and corporations that will grow up around the banks will deprive the people of all property until their children wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered the issuing power should be taken from the banks and restored to the people to whom it properly belongs
9286430 the happy union of these states is a wonder their constitution a miracle their example the hope of liberty throughout the world

9286440 every day you see the devastation all around you a full 3 years after the hurricane and you wonder what you can do to make people aware of the situation here
9286441 i find it very frustrating that practically no one has even heard of st bernard parish which is adjacent to the well known lower ninth ward of new orleans yet this area was at the very epicenter of devastation from hurricane katrina
9286442 hurricane katrina has touched my life personally in a profound way
9286443 i left my home in new hampshire back in early 2006 to volunteer for 3 weeks and ended up making a 5 year commitment to helping with the recovery effort in st bernard parish in april 2006 i helped to establish the community center of st bernard so there would be a permanent location where local residents could receive help in what would obviously be a long and difficult struggle to rebuild
9286444 even three years later the devastation in st bernard parish remains overwhelming
9286445 entire blocks of homes and businesses are empty and derelict marked for destruction there are no hospitals in this parish now and the population is still only about 40 of what it was before the disaster yet the rate of child abuse in st bernard parish is up by 150 compared to pre katrina values and the rate of elder abuse and neglect has risen by an incredible 335 these are clear indications of the severe physical psychological and emotional trauma that the residents of st bernard have endured
9286446 there remains so much to be done here for many of the clients we serve this is not a recovery but merely a later stage in an ongoing crisis
9286447 though numerous celebrities and aspiring politicians including oprah amy goodman and brad pitt have come to new orleans they dont venture beyond the lower ninth ward so they remain in the dark about the lives and struggles of the people in st bernard directly next door separated only by the jackson barracks we hope that this ebay auction will help generate awareness about st bernard parish and we encourage everyone to view the auction and spread word about it even if it isnt practical for them to bid

9286459 there is solid evidence that forty to sixty percent of louisianas coastal wetlands loss can be traced to oil and gas activities

9286462 this does not include their abuses from the previous decades nor the price tag for the damage which would not have occurred during katrina if our natural hurricane defense the wetlands had not been decimated by the oil industry
9286463 shell believes the best solution to help with coastal preservation and assist the states and community that support oil and gas production is outer continental shelf federal revenue sharing
9286464 these projects will protect their oil and gas infrastructure and without that protection who knows what their long term liability will be

9286466 we also rejoice in our sufferings for suffering produces perseverance perseverance character and character hope and hope does not disappoint us because god has poured out his love into our hearts by the holy spirit whom he has given us
9286467 but we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all surpassing power is from god and not from us
9286468 i consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed in us the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of god to be revealed for the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice but by the will of the one who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be liberated from its bondage to decay and brought into the glorious freedom of the children of god

9286788 hillary has done her part now its obamas turn some of that third group at the convention were swayed by hillarys speech some are still waiting for obama to assure them about his experience and ability to handle the job some of them are waiting to hear if he really does understand them and their needs they want to be sure that when obama said so frequently in the primaries that our time has come that it didnt mean their time had passed
9286789 i have shared all of this to lay a foundation for discussing the upcoming election and whom we as christians should vote for
9286790 i am not going to tell you who to vote for
9286791 but i believe we should vote for the person that jesus would vote for
9286792 how do we know whom jesus would cast his vote for we can be absolutely certain jesus would only cast his vote for someone who loves god not in word or tongue but in action and in truth
9286793 i can assure you jesus would not vote for someone who would ever support a pro abortion policy or a candidate who promoted the homosexual lifestyle he wouldnt vote for a person who did not affirm that marriage is between one man and one woman just to name a few topics how can we know this the main reason is because the bible condemns these things as sinful acts before god and jesus wouldnt cast his vote for anyone in power who would use their influence to encourage things that violated gods word
9286794 in his pride the wicked does not seek him in all his thoughts there is no room for god

9287007 hey its shallow here so if you need a breather just hop up
9287008 if they dont wipe out then i wont wipe out
9287009 ok good mile 1 time now try to hold on to that
9287010 sweet now what can you do over the next mile
9287011 manmade emissions of carbon dioxide were not significant before worldwide industrialization began in the 1940s
9287012 you can go outside and spit and have the same effect as doubling carbon dioxide
9287013 if were to have even a medium sized solar minimum we could be looking at a lot more bad effects than global warming would have had
9287014 the global warming alarm is dressed up as science but it is not science it is propaganda i was horrified to read the ipcc 2nd and 3rd assessment reports because there was so much misinformation
9287015 mosquito species that transmit malaria do not usually survive where the mean winter temperature drops below 16 18 degrees c
9287016 in fact mosquitoes are extremely abundant in the arctic the most devastating epidemic of malaria was in the soviet union in the 1920s there were something like 13 million cases a year and something like 600 000 deaths a tremendous catastrophe that reached up to the arctic circle arkhangel a city 300 miles further north than helsinki finland had 30 000 cases and about 10 000 deaths so its not a tropical disease yet these people in the global warming fraternity invent the idea that malaria will move northward
9287017 they are not going extinct or even appear to be affected
9287018 how could it be determined that so many thermometers were wrong by an average of 0 5 degrees in one particular year several decades ago and an accurate retrofit be made why is the adjustment 0 5 degrees one year and 0 1 degrees the next
9287019 i am baffled by the mann claim that incorrect mathematics doesnt matter because the answer is correct anyway
9287020 not because they were wrong indeed these measurements were made by top scientists including two nobel prize winners using techniques that are standard textbook procedures the only reason for rejection was that these measurements did not fit the hypothesis of anthropogenic global warming i regard this as perhaps the greatest scientific scandal of our time
9287021 the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre industrial value of about 280 ppm to 379 ppm in 2005 the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide in 2005 exceeds by far the natural range over the last 650 000 years 180 to 300 ppm as determined from ice cores
9287022 plagued with improper manipulation of data an arbitrary rejection of high readings from old ice and an arbitrary rejection of low readings from young ice simply because they did not fit the preconceived idea of man made global warming
9287023 what frustrates me is the feeling that everything has already been said and published that all rational argument has been used yet it does not help
9287024 trend toward abandoning scientific objectivity in favor of political agendas
9287025 reason environmental extremism emerged was because world communism failed the berlin wall came down and a lot of peaceniks and political activists moved into the environmental movement bringing their neo marxism with them and learned to use green language in a very clever way to cloak agendas that actually have more to do with anticapitalism and antiglobalism than they do anything with ecology or science
9287026 i think if we dont overthrow capitalism we dont have a chance of saving the world ecologically
9287027 the deceit behind the attempts to discredit evidence of climate change reveals matters of importance this deceit has a clear purpose to confuse the public about the status of knowledge of global climate change thus delaying effective action to mitigate climate change the danger is that delay will cause tipping points to be passed such that large climate impacts become inevitable the ones who will live in infamy if we pass the tipping points are the captains of industry ceos in fossil fuel companies such as exxon mobil automobile manufacturers utilities all of the leaders who have placed short term profit above the fate of the planet and the well being of our children
9287028 i dont know what to do now i really thought she was going to show us some thermo stuff

9287033 are our stupid leaders ever going to learn their lesson
9287034 who knows maybe theyre doomed to keep on repeating the mistakes of the past
9287035 you think such and so and i disagree but lets just agree to disagree and move on
9287036 the lord works in mysterious ways its beyond our comprehension
9287037 well horseshoes are supposed to bring good luck so we put it up there

9287043 this medal recognizes the valued contribution of those who sacrificed their health or their lives while serving canada
9287044 we were hoping it would go back beyond the date the government has made it retroactive to but they havent done that
9287045 although we still support the medal anything that honours somebody who serves in the canadian forces is a good thing
9287046 it should be for soldiers under hostile fire not some civilian contractor hiding a bunker who happens to get shrapnel in his leg
9287047 i would imagine theyd better start minting them pretty fast because i think weve probably got a backlog of about 1 000
9287048 when people talk about the few hundred weve had wounded seriously wounded they dont include the people hit in a roadside bomb and then back at work the next day
9287049 were finally becoming more attuned to the need to recognize those who serve
9287050 the system of creating honours is catching up to the reality
9287051 its something sons wore and their fathers wore before them
9287052 i think people will be a bit torn but this is a much more tangible symbol i think the vast majority of the canadian forces will be pleased
9287053 its overdue and the only thing thatll be controversial is those people wounded since the end of the cold war who wont get it

9287061 there is no better time to rock the vote for human rights than now
9287062 under article 21 of the universal declaration of human rights everyone has the right to participate in government and open elections
9287063 house republicans have worked against meaningful election reform at every turn
9287064 so whats the problem dont we want to ensure every eligible citizens vote is cast and counted
9287065 the republican opposition to the bill aborted efforts to improve our electoral system and instead defended the broken election administration system that far too many american voters have become accustomed too
9287066 lofgrens bill has a minimal cost compared to what we spend to protect the vote for citizens in other countries
9287067 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace

9287099 cotton is king still applies when it come to angola
9287100 allows inmates to be trained in work habits and allows them to develop marketable skills in the areas of farming animal husbandry vegetable meat and milk processing
9287101 the warden says it takes good food good medicine good prayin and good playin to have a good prison
9287102 in the conventional plantations slaves were given just enough food clothing and shelter to be a financial asset to the owner the same is true for the louisiana prison system
9287103 prisoners worked out in the field sometimes 17 hours straight rain or shine
9287104 theyd tell you the officer was always right no matter what
9287105 neither slavery nor involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crime where of the party shall have been duly convicted shall exist within the united states
9287106 prisoners can be forced to work for the government against their will and this is true in every state
9287107 i would have more faith in that amendment if it werent so clear that our criminal justice system is racially biased in a really obvious way
9287108 i dont have any illusions that this is a simple process
9287109 many people are apathetic about what happens in prisons it would be very difficult but i would not suggest it would be impossible
9287110 many black inmates viewed farm work under these circumstances as too close to slavery to want to participate
9287111 theyve got a lot of land to bury a lot of prisoners

9287131 mr fryer is a profound student of clark ashton smith and the influence shows but he is very much his own poet and he structures and plays with a surety and deftness which is remarkable
9287132 sidney fryer has created in his fictional atlantis an entire civilization and a body of absorbing literature the book should appeal to lovers of poetry to devotees of science fiction and to those who admire writers who can fashion a realistic world from the materials of mythology and speculation
9287133 these poems are of an unearthly beauty they celebrate love beauty and humanity and yet throughout many of them is a consciousness of impending apocalypse the imagery lush exotic full of colors and magic names is a welcome relief from the sterile prosaic poetry of today if you enjoy tripping on language this book is for you whether the poems really are from the atlantean or whether they are the creations of poet sidney fryer they deserve to be read and experienced

9287141 for the current fiscal year which ends march 31 2009 parliament has voted to spend more than 4 billion on cultural programs including the cbc the canada arts council the national gallery of canada and the department of canadian heritage
9287142 overall program spending during that same period is up 18 6 per cent in other words conservatives have boosted spending on arts programs faster than they have boosted overall government spending
9287143 with new cuts to culture and arts funding the conservative government is showing once again its complete disrespect toward our countrys cultural institutions and a flagrant lack of vision that is hurting our arts community and culture
9287144 the conservatives are now showing clearly what they have in mind for canadas arts and culture
9287145 the lack of explanation for the cuts and the silence of the heritage minister is unacceptable this governments consistent refusal to consider culture as an important part of canadas development is mind boggling
9287146 mr harper also said that his government was committed to weeding out wasteful spending even when that initiative results in cuts to some programs that support the work of artists
9287147 the public reaction out there youd think wed shut down the arts thats not the case
9287148 this was not about less money for the arts it about having government programs that are meeting their objectives were committed to cancelling programs that are boondoggles

9287155 that of unmasking the being of the book re creating that being freeing the book from the author of the book and from the beehive cloister of the affinity group and in the end granting a privilege the authors true privilege is to be misunderstood and the critics true function is to make misunderstanding into a door of perception
9287156 discussions of book covers and posting book covers are examples of raising awareness about a product without actually commenting upon evaluating or criticising the actual product itself youre playing the man and not the ball by taking about the advertising instead of the product itself

9287225 in the absence of a father in the house a girl will seek male fatherly affection outside the home
9287226 the same study suggests that exposure to the pheromones of unrelated males in the household either moms boyfriend or new husband may cause girls to enter puberty prematurely where there is puberty needless to say there is the greater likelihood of sexual activity
9287227 the problem is that some mothers and fathers arent the best role models

9287229 i rather naively thought that this issue would bring feminists to my aid after all what i was asking was that this somewhat overlooked dimension of their revolution be attended to
9287230 but what i found was that far from getting support from feminists the only significant resistance was coming from feminists and the political leaders who live in fear of them
9287231 feminists who resent any suggestion that a mother belongs with her children often insist when it comes to child custody that children belong with the mother

9287241 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9287242 in this very competitive election for them to go pick somebody who is under a cloud of suspicion who is under investigation for abuse of power it just sounds like a pretty slow start to me we need a vice president who can step in if god forbid something happened to john mccain i dont think shes someone who is ready for that 3 a m phone call
9287243 a mixed set of emotions kind of an odd sense of alaska nationalism or pride this is like watching a moon landing or something its just something you dont expect to see very often its wonderful it was an emotional thing to see the governor walk out with her family and i say wow i work for her
9287244 she brings her voice of new energy and change and she knows alaska

9287264 the dreams are beautifully crafted fantasies each with an eerie atmosphere that brings us into a serene la la land where we feel free to imagine pleasing kate
9287265 the camera closes in on her bulging behind as it rides up and down and shakes from side to side

9287267 my personal opinion about nudity in magazines is that i really dont like it
9287268 its funny but i was never attracted to the fully nude look when i pose i like something to play with something to hide behind of course i have posed nude
9287269 im getting to a point where i dont like to pose nude anymore believe it or not im a bit more self conscious now

9287281 from the start nicole seemed determined to lose her baby weight just a week after giving birth she had regained her pre pregnancy figure and dropped nearly all the weight shed gained while expecting
9287282 we think she has since dropped 10lbs below her pre pregnancy weight of 125lbs
9287283 nicole started rehearsals for new musical nine a few weeks after sundays birth shes doing two or three hours of dancing a day on top of that she went right back to working out with a trainer doing yoga and pilates as well as swimming and jogging
9287284 they flew to sydney for some family time but nicole broke down in tears within a few hours of landing she sounds like shes overwhelmed
9287285 i think nicole wants to be the perfect mum so she always tries to be there when sunday opens her eyes in the morning as well as putting her down at night
9287286 but she doesnt seem to be sneaking in more than four hours sleep a night

9287310 this d slr is not only sleek but also speedy
9287311 image quality is very good to excellent auto white balance and exposure is very good and the images have excellent colour with good saturation contrast and detail with low noise except for high iso images given the excellent value for money this camera provides and the extensive features id highly recommend this camera
9287312 image quality improves on previous models in the line with excellent color accuracy and resolution though evidence of its small four thirds sensor is pronounced at its highest iso settings photos suffer from limited dynamic range and high contrast mid tones as did the e 410
9287313 if youre looking for a compact digital slr then the olympus e 420 is absolutely worth a look heck its worth checking out if you dont care about the size of the camera and just want a good entry level slr
9287314 the e 420 produces excellent image quality including excellent low light performance up to iso 400 with plenty of detail preserved we find that the af is very responsive and images snap quickly into focus
9287315 examination of the crops show 100 and 200 iso to be clean and fairly indistinguishable from one another there is a hint of noise showing up at 400 and certainly at 800 with a more dramatic jump from 800 to 1600 but the high settings are perfectly usable
9287316 speaking of holding the preproduction e 420 we handled proved nearly shocking in its tiny size and light weight some staffers initially thought it was a compact large handed testers men and women both found it a little too small small handed users though loved it
9287317 the olympus e 420 delivers the professional grade image quality of a digital slr with the simple operation of a point and shoot camera
9287318 thanks to the cameras small size and lightweight body users can take the e 420 everywhere and they will never miss another shot because the of the cameras straightforward controls additionally our innovative technologies help consumers get more from live view
9287319 the d90s combines imaging technology inherited directly from our d300 and innovative features like live view d movie scene recognition and picture control once again confirming nikons leadership in cutting edge imaging technology add its innovative high performance features such as the cmos image sensor and the extremely wide iso sensitivity range we are convinced that this new camera will appeal to all passionate photographers looking for the next step in creativity
9287320 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber

9287341 oh watch out youre about to hit your saturn return
9287342 wanted a play about canada it was risky because canada has for a long time been thought a dull country with dull people but there was a time when norway was thought dull and ireland was thought absurd yet both of them brought forth plays which have been acclaimed as treasures by theatres around the world
9287343 was very much on the lips of canadians like philpott and tapscott the do gooders who took up the puppet show without having any understanding of its special quality or its cultural background but who were convinced that the task of art was to teach to offer a message in fact and to offer it in terms that the stupidest listener could understand canada was and still is full of such people they think of art of all kinds as a sort of handmaid to education it must have a message and it must get across the truth is that art does not teach it makes you feel and any teaching that may arise from the feeling is an extra and must not be stressed too much in the modern world and in canada as much as anywhere we are obsessed with the notion that to think is the highest achievement of mankind but we neglect the fact that thought untouched by feeling is thin delusive treacherous stuff
9287344 when the government stops spending money on endeavours that provide next to no value to the canadian people it is not pandering it is good government am i the only person in the god forsaken country that remembers we have a fricking health care crisis sure there is an element of pandering and there is plenty of other funding that should be pulled but will not be but the simple act of pulling funding from people who never should have received it is a good thing end of story
9287345 i think that is what i was getting at im all for supporting the arts but i feel that people of mr lewiss status and influence should not be receiving money from the government whether he is right or left wing a friend of mine is an artist and she maintains most of the arts grants go to people who dont need them the real starving artists dont have the influence to affect awards
9287346 the government is the one entity in the country that is least likely to make an intelligent decision on how to spend money in fact the only reasons to access government funding over private are laziness a desire to be unaccountable for the funds you receive and the knowledge that the general public sees no value in your product the government should contribute to the arts through tax credits alone this can amount to a large amount of support ensures there will be a respectable amount of accountability built into the system and will bring the arts community closer to the community it supposedly serves
9287347 fund the olympics and not artists artists leave something behind for future generations athletes well theyre fun to watch someone said independent producers such as avi lewis should pay to find their own distributors maybe but then you should be consistent and argue against all government economic subsidies and incentives lets stop subsidizing automakers oil companies the aerospace industry etc for the most part the organizations and individuals affected here are either completely non ideological such as tafelmusik or engaging in economic development for canadian businesses which employ canadians such as the hot docs festivals toronto documentary forum which among other things brings foreign investment into canadian productions finally whats lost here is that arts and culture have always been an important part of international diplomacy the tories are letting their ideology trump the national interest shame on them
9287348 it doesnt give out a great message and hasnt exactly boosted the reputation of professional footballers in this country
9287349 people coming in like crazy buying water we sold 4 pallets of water yesterday and i thought it was going to slow up but its moving out as much as we can and batteries

9287550 apart from delia if you just wanted one all round simple cookery book with a range of simplified recipes go for 1000 recipe cook book edited by isabelle barrett and jane harrop it varies from standard english stuff to world flavours but with shortcuts on some of the more hard to get ingredients
9287551 it was great fun and all the children really enjoyed it and i would like to point out it was all gentle fun and no snails were harmed during the racing

9287563 you dont make peace with your friends but with your enemies

9287566 far less than 1 percent of the population subscribes to extremist global jihadist views
9287567 indonesia is an experiment in muslim democracy which if successful could have ramifications for other parts of the world
9287568 if the united states wants to advance democracy in the islamic world then indonesia takes on added importance
9287569 we are so happy with the democratization process in indonesia but there is a blackness in this process
9287570 now the door is open everybody can fight for their power to control people suddenly islamic groups want to impose to other muslims their laws
9287571 while there is a growing sense of islamic identity or piety among muslims in indonesia people are free to practice religion in ways that were forbidden under the dictatorship far less than 1 percent of the population subscribes to extremist global jihadist views
9287572 indonesians are turning to islam for help because everything else we have tried has failed us the dutch the military dictatorships even democracy my life is really no better today than it was under suharto
9287573 when youre close to god you are a good person and you have a certain level of impunity
9287574 freedom of speech is an american concept so i dont give it any value
9287575 our belief is that most americans even apsa members have no idea how precarious the rights of freedom of speech and conscience are in canada
9287576 our belief is that the apsa should choose its sites carefully with particular regard for questions of freedom of speech and conscience we therefore believe canada to be a problematic destination
9287577 have recently sought to suppress speech and impose legal penalties on speakers
9287578 the morality of homosexual conduct and the question of legal recognition of same sex unions
9287579 the threat to freedom posed by violent extremists acting in the name of islam

9287581 t he writ of canadas hrcs runs without evident limit to encompass any speech academic or otherwise to which potential complainants take offense
9287582 arbitrariness and procedurally unconstrained practices of the hrcs create an air of uncertainty regarding whose speech on what subjects before what audiences will be targeted next
9287583 the septic idea of policing public opinion has spread rapidly through many canadian institutions under tireless pressure from activists of various kinds feminist homosexual islamist and miscellaneous leftist who hold the notion of free speech in contempt
9287584 freedom of speech is an american concept so i dont give it any value

9287588 in my research i found compelling arguments that muhammad did not have a sexual relationship with aisha while she was a young girl
9287589 i told them i was terrified and desperate that i was just a child and far too young to get married
9287590 i was all alone in a foreign country unable to speak the language
9287591 i was trapped until i escaped i didnt even realize that marrying at 14 wasnt legal in britain everyone i knew in london regarded it as normal
9287592 i used to scream and cry all night i was too young too tender it killed me inside life became meaningless
9287593 how can i respect one who is married and a father and who when he has had enough of the mother of his children brings another woman into his house and is according to the moslem law legally married to her
9287594 sherry jones writes crappy book about aisha amp muhammad muhammedans go apeshit publisher instantly goes into voluntary censorhip
9287595 i have news for you that would be one of the biggest mistakes of your life
9287596 if you are stubborn enough if you are not taking this as seriously as we need you to take it and if you decide to stay you are on your own
9287597 anyone who decides to stay ill say it like i said it before katrina make sure you have an axe because you will be carving your way or busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that you will be surrounded with in this event
9287598 so anyone whos thinking of staying rethink it get out of town
9287599 we are delighted particularly as it was a unanimous decision by the council and they understood exactly what we aim to achieve with the site
9287600 it will be a great asset not only for our own members but also for the wider community and were looking forward to creating something that will be so beneficial
9287601 our plan is to restore the pavilion to how it was and actively engage the community our aim is to also bring back the sports that were once enjoyed including cricket

9287611 there have been some recent signs that our economy is beginning to improve
9287612 the economic stimulus package that i signed earlier this year is having its intended effect

9287616 mcmc runs on its own i am not briefed on the things it does although it did tell me it was blocking the malaysia today website under section 263 of the act which i believe has something to do with threatening national interest
9287617 such blatant and crude employment of state power is inconsistent with the widening of democratic space
9287618 there are other blogs and websites like those of opposition parties pas and pkr which criticise the government the commission has not blocked access to those sites
9287619 we respect the traditions and faith of our muslim brothers and sisters we have muslim soldiers who along with others have brought honor and prestige to the military organization
9287620 i would press the government not to continue the fighting even especial at the ramadan time

9287628 cycling is full of ups and downs ive had numerous injuries so i have to say thanks to all the people who stand behind me
9287629 i didnt care what the conditions were going to be like what the course was
9287630 it was a nice victory for the whole team particularly since i am leaving at the end of the season they were nice enough to let me have it
9287631 this first stage was a beautiful show and the team came out and gave it their all which is the idea with which we have come to the vuelta
9287632 everything went well because with respect to the other main favourites sastre and valverde the differences were minimum and you cant give them great importance
9287633 this first stage has been a beautiful show and the team gave everything i am happy to see that everything has gone well because regarding to the other favorites sastre and valverde the differences are so small that we dont have to give them importance
9287634 and god said let there be light and there was light

9287638 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9287639 i think obamas going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice
9287640 hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president

9287746 we have learned that we know that we can do it our past history shows that we can do it but winning here last year just kind of cemented those confident thoughts in place and we rolled it from here into richmond and won again on a track thats been very challenging to us over the years that really just put us in the right mindset that hey you can do this

9287760 the reason there arent more googles is not that investors encourage innovative startups to sell out but that they wont even fund them ive learned a lot about vcs during the 3 years weve been doing y combinator because we often have to work quite closely with them the most surprising thing ive learned is how conservative they are vc firms present an image of boldly encouraging innovation only a handful actually do and even they are more conservative in reality than youd guess from reading their sites
9287761 i used to think of vcs as piratical bold but unscrupulous on closer acquaintance they turn out to be more like bureaucrats theyre more upstanding than i used to think the good ones at least but less bold maybe the vc industry has changed maybe they used to be bolder but i suspect its the startup world that has changed not them the low cost of starting a startup means the average good bet is a riskier one but most existing vc firms still operate as if they were investing in hardware startups in 1985

9287766 the issue is in what context form and national framework this is not just about the air force it has to fit with the strategic command and the broader national security community and were going to make sure all those pieces fit together as we proceed
9287767 the military is thinking more about the non kinetic effects of warfare
9287768 it makes sense to have the guys delivering most of the precision ordnance from the air to have control over both the kinetic and the non kinetic aspects of the operation
9287769 traditionally the air force has carried out strategic bombing strategic cyberwarfare could be seen as an extension of that mission
9287770 fifty years later they are still squabbling over which is the lead service in space
9287771 the national security agency may have tapped into a foreign command and control system while the air force simultaneously has plans to take it out

9287893 fortunately i wasnt daunted because i didnt know at all how daunting this project was fortunately i obtained some small donations to start and focused on the south bronx at the time in 1990 the south bronx was not only the poorest and sickest area of new york but shattered by drugs abandonment and such widespread arson with owners torching their buildings for the insurance money that it looked like a bombed area when new yorks longest and most deadly drug war erupted on the block of our office we had to literally walk through almost daily gunfire for months
9287894 part of the reason i wasnt reasonably worried or afraid was that some of my friends in aids seeking the spiritual support we all needed so badly had become buddhists and introduced me to the soka gakkai a vibrant international buddhism the other part was this although i had grown up in financial comfort id been through multiple discomforting experiences essentially ending up homeless as a teenager then in treatment for a severe spine curvature i couldnt walk for almost a year after that i had the luck to go to a terrific new england girls school dana hall for two years in the new england spirit the school was determined to truly educate all students smart or not and certainly this ineluctable and unexpected attention to my mind and development was very reviving at the time in sum i knew both the shattering impact of real illness and the power of real education i now came to the idea that my past especially its difficulties had had an actual purpose preparing me to know that real education was vital fighting an epidemic mainly striking women who had been harshly left out of society and trying to get that education to them as we all know being seized by ideas like this can lead either to missions or madness but in either case give one much determination

9287896 how is it even possible for example that 40 of people in the south bronx already have diabetes or dangerously high blood sugar the toll which leaves communities helpless and angry as well as ill has substantially to do with the working or nonworking of society in showing that people can develop the skills knowledge and spiritual confidence to take control of their own health we see health as a transforming issue a means to help communities move from hopelessness to a focus on building

9288256 you cannot get something right unless you have a thorough knowledge of it jean was a conscious and dedicated artist who wrote novels not a woman displaying or brooding over her own experience in the form of autobiography but she never denied that the material for her novels came from her own life she thought or said that she chose to use it because it was the only thing she knew well but she was not really choosing she was following her nature she could not have done anything else being a deeply self absorbed person who was also honest

9288268 the fact that protesters have been using canoes to deliver messages to the pipelaying ship and that protesters were preparing to swim out in wetsuits to the ship does not warrant the deployment of a warship in the bay

9288310 knowing the price of everything but the value of nothing
9288311 rich countries must reduce if not eliminate distortional agriculture and energy policies and help those in the poorest countries improve their capacity to produce food but this is just a start we have treated our most precious resources clean air and water as if they were free only new patterns of consumption and production a new economic model can address that most fundamental resource problem
9288312 i have heard that people may become dependent on us for food to me that is good news because before people can do anything they have got to eat and if you are looking for a way to get people to lean on you and be dependent on you in terms of their own cooperation with you it seems to me that food dependence would be terrific
9288313 those in the poorest countries improve their capacities to produce food
9288314 let us remember that the main purpose of aid is not to help other nations but to help ourselves
9288315 the push by some developing countries to become more self sufficient in food may be reminiscent of a bygone era these countries could save money by importing more food from the us
9288316 food self sufficiency is a peculiarly obtuse way of thinking about food security
9288317 there are situations in which self sufficiency is important such as during wars at one stage in the second world war there was a real danger of britain not being able to get enough food into the country but that is a very peculiar situation and we are not in one like that now nor are we likely to be in the near future

9288360 the loss of wang and then joba hurt this team tremendously but in losing posada they lost their heart and soul
9288361 this means nothing bos isnt playing the same team we are they arent getting the same pitchers on the same days that we are baseball is situational you cant compare us to them unless everything is equal and its not
9288362 this means nothing bos isnt playing the same team we are they arent getting the same pitchers on the same days that we are baseball is situational you cant compare us to them unless everything is equal and its not
9288363 this is a very simple game you throw the ball you catch the ball you hit the ball sometimes you win sometimes you lose sometimes it rains
9288364 check the charleston and gcl team out red sox management has been drafting since 2000 we stood in to pay attention to the draft more in 04 but in 05 was when oppenheimer took control of it
9288365 jeter the captain defended his teammate who has been criticized this season for too often making seemingly nonchalant efforts on defense
9288366 its a play hes made 100 times in that situation the throw s a little bit low but no you cant say it was nonchalant or anything like that its a play he works on hes good at it just in that situation it was a little off
9288367 why cant we find young pitchers who do well like bowden
9288368 that means it either had to be arod or mussina
9288369 your talkative ones are giambi and damon its rare that you have a true yankee there it is again say nasty things about a teammate especially about a contract
9288370 cc sabathia is a must this offseason again cashman should be placing players on waivers right now giambi damon heck even matsui sell the vets id even dangle nady you never know what a team will give up for him
9288371 id trade nady for some prospects what about nady for tabata mccutchen and karstens
9288372 do you think any one interesting gets a september callup by interesting i mean someone we havent see this year
9288373 i think juan miranda has an outside shot at a callup considering hes already on the 40 man
9288374 bad day for the yanks huh i still think it will be ok um if we dont lose any games in september
9288375 miranda plays above average defense and has really improved his plate discipline in aaa this year
9288376 looks like milb made a mistake it was noel castillo who started today for tampa not sanchez wow thats not only a mistake but a complete fn embarassment to milb

9288379 pete i love the blog and check multitple times a day but honestly its enough criticizing girardi what did he do to you early in the year that has caused this kind of hatred
9288380 raymagnetic no one cares what alex rodriguez did with the mariners or the rangers
9288381 no way they should have given robbie that contract hes the last guy who should have gotten a contract like that
9288382 they never gave a deal like that to derek jeter or bernie williams or jorge posada or mariano rivera with so much time to go before free agency they could have given it to cano or chien ming wang they picked the wrong guy
9288383 just look at red sox second baseman dustin pedroia and the year hes having the difference between him and cano is the difference between the teams pedroia doesnt have one quarter the talent of cano but hes outplaying him by a mile
9288384 trust me his so called clutch numbers are really good as a yankee
9288385 so you made an error today and you cost the team the game how do you feel about that and what are you going to do to correct it
9288386 i cant stand the red sox but we need more of what youkliss and pedroia bring to the field every day
9288387 we couldnt manage the games like this in april and may because we would have burned out guys in the bullpen
9288388 and it did hit jeters glove he should have caught that ball or at least knocked it down
9288389 and to comment on the si remarks i couldnt agree more i thought it was an insult to previous yankees such as dj and mo that cashman broke the mold with cano there was no reason to sign him to a lucrative long term deal at this stage in his career and if the choice came between him and wang who has won 19 games in each of the past 2 seasons the choice was clearly wang
9288390 cashmans worst mistake in the offseason was not the non santana trade though that was an awful decision too but his decision to let bowa go
9288391 raymagnetic alex rodriguez didnt play in meaningful game after may 15th as a texas ranger

9288622 the selection of governor palin is an insult to women she has obviously been chosen to appeal to female voters but she lacks both the experience and policy positions to serve as vice president of the united states
9288623 the announcement of governor palins selection on john mccains 72nd birthday highlights the fact t hat the vice president must be qualified to step into the presidency from day one sarah palin is a 2 year governor with zero foreign policy experience whose former position was mayor of a town of 9 000
9288624 after trying to make experience the issue of this campaign john mccain celebrated his 72nd birthday by appointing a former small town mayor and brand new governor as his vice presidential nominee is this really who the republican party wants to be one heartbeat away from the presidency given sarah palins lack of experience on every front and on nearly every issue this vice presidential pick doesnt show judgment it shows political panic
9288625 ben dis donc tavais pas lair en forme sur ton message hier soir
9288626 that just doesnt sound like something that were ready for maybe later but that sounds just way beyond the scope of what were capable of
9288627 i dont know whether or not theres an investigation i just know that authorities have contacted my client and he has cooperated
9288628 i was blindsided by mr fords attack and resignation letter it was in my opinion outrageous very malicious on a personal level i am very hurt and im also very angry and sad
9288629 we have never not once been contacted let me be very clear by any federal investigator by any investigator of any kind whether its me or any member of my administration
9288630 we have yet to be asked one question i know theres been rumors ive been made aware of the rumors that are out there but i can only state the facts that that has not taken place we have not been questioned nobody has been approached
9288631 well im sorry that he feels that the comments were malicious but the truth is an absolute defense to a libel action isnt it
9288632 if a public official ford has been contacted by authorities and has cooperated in matters of mutual interest you can determine whether there is an investigation or not
9288633 theyre designed to attempt to attack me and this administration and i stand here confident that that decision and all other decisions that were made were made appropriately
9288634 the reality the situation is that mr ford has made some serious allegations and he has the wherewithal to prove them
9288635 i dont know whether or not theres an investigation i just know that authorities have contacted my client and he has cooperated

9288638 the state of the unions in 2008 a profile of union membership in los angeles california and the nation
9288639 it shows that despite an extremely hostile environment unions can grow
9288640 the labor movement here is in much better shape than in much of the rest of the country if this years nationwide increase proves to be a lasting trend historians will look back and see the leading edge of that growth here in the west
9288641 one component of this growth is recent union organizing like the service employees international unions successful security officer campaign here in but the regions unionization rates are affected by many other factors
9288642 if jobs are lost in nonunion sectors due to an economic downturn as weve seen recently in residential construction for example that can lead to an increase in the unionization rate if other things are stable
9288643 this age variation reflects the fact that unionized jobs on average provide workers with substantially higher wages than do nonunion jobs
9288644 higher wages are typically associated with lower turnover which generates an older workforce over time and unionized jobs offer more job security than nonunion jobs which further reduces turnover and adds to the increase in the average age of unionized workers
9288645 whereas decades ago the archetypal union member was a blue collar worker with limited education today mid level professionals are much more likely to be unionized than anyone else especially in sectors like educational service and public administration which both have relatively large numbers of college educated workers

9288651 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9288652 you need to be scared you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans this is the storm of the century
9288653 why does this gap exist dont know but it may simply be a matter of ideology men are generally a bit more conservative than women and opinions of palin are very strongly determined by ideology
9288654 stand up for a real woman one just like you vote mccain
9288655 what do you think of mccains vp isnt she so pretty shes really smart mccain can make history too
9288656 he wants to do something service oriented if and when the storm hits and its as bad as its expected to be now
9288657 i thought id come down and share some insight into this final 53 man roster obviously this brings some closure to this particular phase of the process i have a working 53 man roster going year round particularly during training camp some of the decisions we make are based on performance upside potential future needs and of course injuries always play a factor into what we are doing there could be a tweak or two over the next couple days as you guys know its always a little bit in flux particularly on the back end of the roster we will add our practice squad players tomorrow
9288658 i think a couple different things have gone on with him but i feel like he had ample opportunity this go around as a third year player through otas mini camp and training camp it didnt turn out the way he wanted it and it didnt turn out the way we wanted it hes not the first and he wont be last third rounder to be released from his original team i think it will happen a lot within the next 24 hours
9288659 he is off the pup and is on the 53 man roster i dont know if the hadnot injury had as much to do with it as the lennie friedman piece of it because lennie was basically on the 53 and that cleared a spot with the depth issues with lennie and hadnot together it probably preempted tucker being on the pup we probably could have gone either way with it because he is a little bit in between is it two weeks is it six weeks only time will tell here but it was more the creation of the spot by lennie going on injured reserve

9288680 there was snide criticism from the republican establishment that palin fought in her underdog gubernatorial campaign in 2006 after six years as wasillas mayor shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president said state senate president lyda green a wasilla republican who told the anchorage daily news that she at first thought news of palins selection was a joke
9288681 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
9288682 my mom who really idolized my dad had the effect on us of kind of idolizing him
9288683 yet at the same time i became aware i think when i was either in my very earliest teens or even before that that my father had a struggle with alcohol and i watched him fight and fight this sickness so i not only idolized him but i also understood that he had flaws like all of us and probably his greatest was his struggle against alcoholism which made him a very religious man he prayed every night on his knees he was very religious because he saw hell combating alcoholism a struggle that he knew he could not successfully win by himself
9288684 oh im sure there were times in my squadron life when i overindulged but almost never i just didnt im sure the example of my father may have had some kind of effect
9288685 his evident pride in claiming such distinguished ancestry gave me the sense not only that i had a claim on my countrys history but that it would fall to me to represent the family when the history of my generation was recorded
9288686 my mother did a good job of keeping him alive for us
9288687 she was very good at reminding us of him and of his example
9288688 the relationship of a sailor and his children is in large part a metaphysical one
9288689 we see much less of our fathers than do other children our fathers are often at sea in peace and war our mothers run our households pay the bills and manage most of our upbringing it is no surprise then that the personalities of children who have grown up in the navy often resemble those of their mothers more than those of their fathers
9288690 our fathers perhaps because of and not in spite of their long absences can be a huge presence in our lives you are taught to consider their absence not as a deprivation but as an honor by your fathers calling you are born into an exclusive noble tradition its standards require your father to dutifully serve a cause greater than his self interest and everyone around you your mother other relatives and the whole navy world drafts you to the cause as well
9288691 all my life i had been rootless part of a tradition that compensated me in other ways for the hometown it denied me but without a connection to one place one safe harbor where i could rest without care i had lived my life on the move never entirely at ease the landscape and characters passed too rapidly to form the attachments of common love that quicken your heart when age and infirmity have slowed your walk and deprived your restlessness of its familiar expressions

9288703 this is a country that has more ingenuity and if what were known for is american ingenuity yankee ingenuity whatever you want to call it what happened to it where is it lets see it its in somebodys garage i like to use the internet to explore the world looking for fringe technologies and its great theyre all out there theyre on youtube all these guys with their ideas scientists men and women around the world universities people in different countries they all have different ideas of how to do things and get to and all kinds of things that would help to change the world i think when we can solve that problem then the need for war will go away

9288720 products from grass fed animals are safer than food from conventionally raised animals
9288721 research has shown that the strains of e coli most devastating to humans are the product of feedlots not cows this is due to the animals being forced to eat an unnatural diet and not their natural choice grass
9288722 grass fed standard states that grass and or forage shall be the feed source consumed for the lifetime of the ruminant animal with the exception of milk consumed prior to weaning the diet shall be derived solely from forage and animals cannot be fed grain or grain by products and must have continuous access to pasture during the growing season
9288723 while one cannot rule out a role of cattle diet on affecting exposure and infectivity of e coli o157 h7 to humans the data available at present demonstrate that cattle on a wide variety of diets including 100 forage diets are regularly and similarly colonized with this pathogen
9288724 100 of the diets were made up of native grasses forages or cut grasses or forages

9288780 were mccain supporters because hes conservative i believe he stands for more of the values that we do hes pro life
9288781 my brother works in the alaskan oil fields and i understand palin has about a 90 percent approval rating there
9288782 mccain could have gone soft on pro life but he didnt and hes a fiscal conservative
9288783 i really like what john mccain stands for especially on the issue of pro life and i think sarah palin is an excellent choice to join him on the republican ticket
9288784 she is pro life and she is a woman which i really like
9288785 i am very impressed by senator mccains choice he made a good choice and i am very happy that she is a social conservative i like her position on the social issues and i think she will add strength to the mccain ticket because he has already taken a strong position on the same social issues
9288786 i think she is so very american from everything she believes in and everything she has done he could not have made a better choice she may not have a lot of national experience but that shouldnt affect voting for mccain and palin she has about the same governmental administrative experience as obama has
9288787 because i havent made my mind up yet i am a democrat but i am excited about palin she has been running the state of alaska and apparently doing a good job i like what i have heard so far
9288788 i think gov palin will bring new and fresh ideas to the campaign plus she is a woman and that is good news i believe she may draw some of the hillary clinton supporters to john mccains campaign and i like the fact she is pro life
9288789 she chose to have her baby after she found out it would likely be a down syndrome baby that tells me a lot about her as a woman and a person she is a strong woman who understands what the average american is going through these days and i believe she will bring a lot to the national political scene now and in the future
9288790 because she stands for a lot of solid beliefs such as family values and moral issues i also like the fact she favors drilling for oil
9288791 i think a lot of women who supported hillary clinton will now consider voting for the mccain palin ticket and that will help us win in november
9288792 i dont care that we have sat in the sun for several hours today
9288793 we are absolutely thrilled by senator mccains choice of sarah palin she fills a lot of squares for the republicans she will be an asset for the ticket
9288794 the sun doesnt matter today because it is just good to be here today to see this historic campaign ticket i am excited and very happy with the addition of sarah palin to the campaign
9288795 i think the issues that needed to be addressed have been in this proposed contract
9288796 i will be working to make copies of our documents to discuss the agreement with the stewards and then those representatives and myself will be in the mill later today and in the coming days to explain the agreement to our membership
9288797 there was a real sense of solidarity and unity on the issues as we continued negotiations

9288819 we didnt come to california just to play well and almost win like last year
9288820 it was about getting over the hump and i dont think we performed like we should have we came out in the first half and we were flat we have to go all four quarters not just the second half
9288821 we may be seeing the first woman president as a democrat i am reeling

9288989 this second letter effects a further significant change in the position of the government of the united states
9288990 would seriously harm the existing intelligence sharing arrangements between the united kingdom and the united states
9288991 itll be the largest storm to approach the gulf coast and the united states since hurricane katrina in 2005
9288992 we just finished a two hour video teleconference with state and local officials to talk about the preparations we have in place in advance of hurricane gustav
9288993 there have been phenomenal improvements at the local level the state level and the federal level that we will benefit from
9288994 all states are talking to each other planning together sharing resources and working together as a team
9288995 since hurricane katrina hit in 2005 the new orleans hurricane damage reduction system is stronger than it was pre katrina
9288996 we will continue to respond for department of defense support in anticipation of landfall
9288997 they are provided with situational awareness and provided with prepare to deploy orders if needed
9288998 negotiations went on at the highest level in kinshasa between the u n and the ministry of defense between our military force commander and the chief of staff of the armed forces and also in goma with representatives of the cndp but definitely the situation is tense
9288999 but there was a lot of tension in the air already for many days and it needed just some small incident which could blow off the tension and now it has happened we really regret it but all of the parties have expressed its willingness to come back to the negotiating table even cndp said this kind of incident is not in their interest at all
9289000 we have had a situation where some of the testimonies have been contested by people in public for instance mr conneh as a matter of fact he was jeered or booed in the hall when he testified and it seemed as though people who witnessed the actions of his men were certainly not agreed to the testimony he gave
9289001 so there have been discussions on the streets of monrovia and people are very much bitter there have been calls to talk shows and people are criticizing especially his testimony
9289002 mr conneh had modified his concluding statement at the hearing to ask that a monument be built for him as a liberator of the people he has said that he has brought liberation to liberia so we can have democracy today and that has been his insistence
9289003 he has refused to take responsibility for whatever might have occurred during the course of the conflict and he says he cannot take responsibility for things committed by his soldiers
9289004 clearly prince johnsons testimony has also been a subject of discussion especially with his revelation that the former president who was killed was later exhumed and then burned and that has sparked confusion in the streets
9289005 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9289006 going someplace you don t know people you don t know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9289007 we re doing this more for looters than the storm
9289008 i don t think the hurricane will break them but i don t want someone breaking in
9289009 there will be immigration people there and we re all undocumented
9289010 it was a friendship made in stone they were like blood brothers almost
9289011 i knew it was going to be difficult for him
9289012 but when i told him there was shock and disbelief on his face
9289013 i was really concerned about how it would affect him
9289014 we rejoice in our sending back to you what you so graciously extended to us we rejoice in the return of jabir to his lord
9289015 it is truly an honor and privilege to be part of lpd 17s maiden deployment
9289016 when i look back at the accomplishments and effort by the crew getting the first ship in the san antonio class warship ready i am proud and humbled at the same time
9289017 the operational flexibility of our strike group is greatly enhanced by san antonios capabilities
9289018 its multi functional design supports technological advances in landing craft aircraft and amphibious vehicles the ship has a state of the art command and control suite more than double the storage space of the ships it replaces and advanced survivability features that enhance its ability to operate in the littoral environment
9289019 its ironic that my first deployment is the first for the san antonio also
9289020 ive waited for this moment for a long time to visit places in the world that i dreamed of seeing as a kid
9289021 i wanted to help see this ship get underway to show that the blood sweat and tears from its crew both past and present have paid off
9289022 the ship demonstrated flawless execution of procedures for getting underway and conducted a highly efficient onload of marines and their equipment i fully expect to see the same excellence from san antonio and its crew throughout deployment
9289023 i believe in a long prolonged derangement of the senses in order to obtain the unknown

9289028 this particular company were talking about in germany is selling at point four book value you couldnt build capacity at even close to that price
9289029 companies have become so weakened that they cant continue to move on thats one of the situations we have today
9289030 their installed production base is so antiquated that theyre having to shut down facilities
9289031 they have enough money to stay in the game but dont have enough money to invest heavily

9289033 battle of the border meeting its a little difficult to develop much solid analysis from a line score but there were some encouraging signs to take from the post game stats of the montana grizzlies 82 72 win in the first game of the battle of the border against the university of calgary dinos played in calgary saturday because the tourney is defined as international competition the grizzlies will log four labor day tourney games which dont count on their season record well in advance of the normal first week in november start of ncaa basketball play the griz trailing by three after a quarter and by 40 34 at halftime rallied quickly at the start of the second half on a layup by post brian qvale and a trey by guard ryan staudacher off a feed by 6 6

9289035 on top of these battles the political demands have not been met or entered by the administration especially the prime minister so even though they can arrest and disperse and arrest some of the protesters many expect the protesters will regroup not only in bangkok but in various places
9289036 a political crisis like this will not end with one crackdown or one raid
9289037 there will be an aftermath a long standing confrontation between the two sides now that at least the state enterprise unions are going to join the pad as well

9289040 i thought at first the noise could be coming from some old bearings in the foyers hydro station across the loch
9289041 but when i went out of the house i couldnt hear anything at all
9289042 i have to confess its bizarre it gets into your head and is like a buzzing sound vibrating like an empty football i think its a resonance frequency putting your fingers in ears doesnt help ive heard it start at 2am and it would carry on until 8am my mother has heard it too
9289043 its a complete mystery because you only seem to hear it from indoors and its exactly the same as what is being experienced in suffolk
9289044 if someone had said to me a spacecraft had landed on the meadows i would have said well i heard it
9289045 we have had reports of a low humming noise which is loud enough to wake local residents
9289046 we will investigate this but it will be very much a process of elimination to try and identify a noise source
9289047 this is the mission weve been training for almost a year to carry out
9289048 every sailor in this strike group has tremendous focus right now our pilots and maintenance crews are extremely sharp and well do our part to help coalition troops and foster security in afghanistan

9289064 poor coordination and physical function in childhood linked to adult obesity
9289065 obesity can be defined as a body mass index rating of greater than 25
9289066 at the most basic an individuals weight is the energy balance between calories eaten and calories utilized
9289067 forty percent of americans do not participate in any leisure time physical activity
9289068 childrens rates of activities have also screen time has increased
9289069 the availability and cost of healthy choices at neighborhood grocery stores neighborhood safety issues purportedly leading to sedentary lifestyles and social cultural traditions
9289070 at odds with substantial scientific evidence illuminating a precise and powerful biological system that maintains body weight within a relatively narrow range
9289071 the heritability of obesity is equivalent to that of height and
9289072 tremendous body of research employing a great variety of methodologies has failed to yield any meaningful or replicable differences in the caloric intake or eating patterns of the obese compared to the nonobese
9289073 i heard a great suggestion of having signs in the parking lot showing the calories burned by besides offering wellness programs for employees she said nurse leaders are in the ideal position to help encourage their organizations to implement corporate wellness programs to include assessments of individuals and devise
9289074 include classes and support groups for weight management smoking cessation and other healthy lifestyle coaching
9289075 obesity is the epidemic in this country nurse leaders should participate in the public debate as health leaders to assist elected officials in finding ways to address this national crisis
9289076 president lamplighter consulting llc greenfield wi and a nursing economics editorial board member
9289077 a leadership development program designed to prepare a select cadre of registered nurses who are in senior executive positions for influential roles in shaping the u s health care system of the future the ultimate goal was to help the nursing profession gain a more influential voice in setting and implementing health care policy
9289078 the enf program is creating a cadre of nursing leaders who think differently act differently collaborate differently and negotiate differently this will help to change the course of nursing and health care in this country
9289079 obesity prevention in child care a review of u s state regulations
9289080 states should provide the same regulations for both family child care homes and centers
9289081 mere existence of a regulation however does not necessarily ensure compliance or enforcement
9289082 poor coordination physical function in childhood linked to adult obesity
9289083 showed that poorer motor function was associated with later obesity even after adjustment for bmi and markers of pubertal stage
9289084 however a small controlled trial of adolescents 2 months of supplementation with fish oil was associated with significant reductions in headache frequency and severity but these improvements were not significantly better than improvements noted among control patients who took olive oil similar studies also found effects no better than olive oil placebo
9289085 an herbal medicine that is traditionally used in ayurvedic and tibetan systems and may be useful for patients who are troubled by nausea and vomiting
9289086 randomized controlled trials suggest that acupuncture has significant benefits for both adult and pediatric patients with chronic headaches both migraines and tension type headaches
9289087 according to a recent study benefits persisted for 6 months of follow up although sham treatment produced similar effects
9289088 chiropractic therapy is used by over 10 of migraine sufferers to help prevent symptoms
9289089 anecdotal experience and pilot studies suggest that spinal manipulation particularly of the cervical spine can be effective for some patients however dramatic adverse effects of cervical manipulation in a few case reports eg fatal cerebral artery dissections have limited the number of referrals of migraine patients from allopathic healthcare providers to chiropractors
9289090 a pilot or feasibility study is a small experiment designed to test logistics and gather information prior to a larger study in order to improve the latters quality and efficiency a pilot study can reveal deficiencies in the design of a proposed experiment or procedure and these can then be addressed before time and resources are expended on large scale studies
9289091 a preparatory investigation that is in no way intended to test the research hypotheses of interest
9289092 several case series and small studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of osteopathic therapy in preventing tension type headaches
9289093 a single trial of cervical mobilization oscillation of a joint within its normal range of movement and cervical manipulation movement of a joint beyond its normal range of movement provided little support for the use of these interventions for patients with chronic headache
9289094 there is a paucity of evidence from randomized trials that any of these interventions is truly effective
9289095 a lack of high quality trials the existing trials tended to be of poor methodological quality and are therefore subject to bias
9289096 there is no evidence of specific benefit with chiropractic for headache
9289097 there is no evidence that it works and not a single trial was of sufficient quality or validity and size and was positive
9289098 quality validity and appropriateness of the application and method of acupuncture used
9289099 since the unfortunate injury to simon walton the midfield area is one we have been trying hard to fill
9289100 mikele is an outstanding athlete and footballer who can come straight into the team in that position and i think he is a real quality acquisition for the football club
9289101 qpr only contacted me on wednesday i had a word with john gregory and a look around the place on thursday and i was very impressed with what i saw
9289102 im happy with the ambitions of the club and hopefully we can all progress together
9289103 im hardworking honest and i am never one to shy away hopefully i can bring some steel into the centre of the park
9289104 its really nice to be back and to see all the familiar faces
9289105 ive kept in contact with quite a few of the lads now i just cant wait to pull on a shirt and start playing
9289106 there has been talk about a move back almost since i moved to cardiff but im just delighted to be back here at loftus road
9289107 the club has moved on the squad is bigger and the training facilites are excellent
9289108 there is a lot of talent in the squad but id also like to think i have improved as a player
9289109 i have the same attributes but ive added a few touches to my game
9289110 qpr has always been a big part of my life i used to come back and visit when i was at cardiff
9289111 i just hope that the fans welcome me back im sure there may be a few sceptics but it is up to me to win them over
9289112 i know both ian holloway and tim breacker and they both had excellent things to say about the club they both know what type of player i am and im delighted that its happened
9289113 this is a challenge that i need after such a long time at west ham you find yourself having to prove yourself all over again
9289114 sometimes if you stay at one club for too long you can get a bit stale now ive got to prove myself to ian holloway
9289115 i think this year the play offs are what the manager wants and im sure thats what everyone here wants to be able to achieve
9289116 ill pray to the lord on high to rescue me
9289117 you must have thought i was a snack because youre sticking to me like clingwrap
9289118 i know its only a point but its an important point it was two good football sides and theyll cause you problems but other than dele adebolas header we were fairly comfortable
9289119 dexter has been on his deathbed all week but he did very well and worked very hard up top on his own
9289120 he throws the ball to the man the man lets it go and its ledesmas fault ill be having a look at the video
9289121 there were a lot of yellow cards flying about not too many for us look how many challenges went in on dexter
9289122 but i dont want to detract from what was a resilient performance
9289123 all in all eight points in four games is a good return
9289124 if we were winning our two home games and drawing our two away games then we would all be really pleased but its been the other way round
9289125 unfortunately weve drawn two home games but there have been parts of both those games that i have been really pleased with
9289126 when a team goes down to ten men no but when you are playing ten men they will sit nine behind the ball and keep one up front
9289127 they proved difficult to break down and let us play in the first two thirds of the field and made sure they defended as best they could dele did get the header in but it was a great save by the keeper
9289128 they decided they didnt want to go out and win the game and it was up to us to try and win it in doing that we had lots of play on the edge and inside the box and when we did get through their keeper made good saves
9289129 it wasnt a case of us missing chances we just werent creating enough chances
9289130 people may wonder why we didnt bring steve brooker on but we felt it we needed to open the game out a bit and bringing ivan sproule on created more opportunities two or three times he got in and he was very unlucky
9289131 i thought it was a good football match actually i thought they looked a good team and we looked a good team
9289132 as far as the tackle was concerned it was on the other side of the pitch so i couldnt see it properly but once he got called over we knew the lad was in trouble
9289133 its a big step for john from the conference but he is a big lad with bags of pace and we feel he has it in him to become a championship player
9289134 he missed pre season with a slight groin problem so he may need a little while to get fully match fit but i expect him to be challenging for a first team place very soon
9289135 i would have preferred it if rangers had kept 11 players on the field after the sending off they got nine men behind the ball and closed all the gaps
9289136 we had one great chance when dele adebolas header brought a fantastic save but we probably didnt create enough decent opportunities
9289137 their player deliberately jumped out of the way of the ball to make it look worse than it was
9289138 after that emmanuel showed his inexperience with a silly tackle to get himself sent off
9289139 i thought our defending from then on was outstanding we know we have quality players but you also need resilience in the championship
9289140 in that respect im more pleased with this point than our home victory over doncaster bristol city are a very good side and will be up there challenging again
9289141 i think the referee had a bit of a problem with that first booking it was unbelievably harsh
9289142 i told emmanuel at halftime not to get a red card and the tackle for his second booking was a bit silly
9289143 this will be a lesson for the young man he needs to be a bit more disciplined
9289144 but the referee gave himself a problem with the first booking which i felt was very harsh
9289145 with the benefit of hindsight id have rathered ledesma hadnt have been sent off
9289146 if hed stayed on qpr would have continued to try and win the game
9289147 we will no longer have a civilian intelligence arm yes we will have analysts but we wont have any real civilian intelligence capability
9289148 we were really surprised when she wanted to do it
9289149 they made us line up in bathing suits and turn our backs so the male judges could look at our butts i couldnt believe it
9289150 from looking at the other candidates he had i was impressed by their credentials but i couldnt be happier with the selection he made she has leadership skills shes a woman shes a mother

9289153 we are an army of light and nothing shall prevail against us and in those places where the sun is darkened it will overcome
9289154 a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death
9289155 this is what we trained for this is what we signed up for so when we finally get to show up and make a difference for somebody it is very fulfilling
9289156 just not knowing what to expect and you figure well be away from our families for two weeks and i dont know yet what well be walking into

9289160 the story spoke to me on so many levels both personal and artistic the women in johns early life truly shaped who he became and the strengths and weaknesses of their relationships are central to this film
9289161 i love guitar hero and i think its a part of pop culture i would love to do a guitar hero movie if activision would ever let me im trying to convince them but why would you have a movie screw up such a huge franchise not that i would make a bad movie so that would be cool to do a guitar her o movie it could be about a kid from a small town who dreams of being a rock star and he wins the guitar hero competition one of these dreams come true kind of concepts
9289162 i loved director christopher nolans the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
9289163 of course it is true it is written in my book that is the ultimate proof
9289164 atheists are men who look at the skies and try to explain what they can t see
9289165 religious people are men who lives by a book written by people who once looked at the skies and tried to explain what they saw
9289166 i can t wait for religions to be a thing of the past
9289167 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century

9289170 i wouldnt worry about whether the evacuation in your parish begins at 4 p m today or 8 a m tomorrow
9289171 when it comes to evacuation do it sooner rather than later
9289172 my last 24 hours have been somewhat worrisome and very very prayerful because this is a very serious threat and its a lot of people to get to safe ground or be safe where they are
9289173 this is very very serious and we need you to heed this warning
9289174 we really dont have the resources to rescue you after this

9289190 the corleonesi gained ascendancy in the 1980s riina engaged a palermitan pino mandalari as his accountant and business advisor both mandalari and siino his minister of public works were at once masons and collusive with the mafia
9289191 m asons wanted to form a coalition with the mafias highest ranking members michele greco cousin of salvatore and bontade himself were chosen from palermo pippo calderone from catania
9289192 according to the former grandmaster of the grande oriente giuliano dibernardo during the years 1976 80 mafiosi competed to become masons it was the drug mafias way of approaching and infiltrating power
9289193 i deologues were joining the super secret lodges and so were mafiosi
9289194 there were 2 441 men of honor mafiosi distributed among 113 lodges in sicily of these 33 how symbolic were indicted or convicted and another 335 figured in various police records

9289208 we need a social license the ok from the community to operate
9289209 allows california to grow but in a way that is consistent with our environmental goals
9289210 gas prices certainly may have an impact on growth patterns but i think thats only one piece of it
9289211 im not confident that the current state of gas prices alone will combat sprawl
9289212 this is not about mandating where people live but it is about urging our cities and counties about being more thoughtful about where people live
9289213 we own 86 donumms of land but we can only farm the 20 donumms furthest from the border it is too dangerous for us to work on the rest of our land
9289214 yousef and i have lost more than 300 000 because we cant farm our land any more
9289215 we had almond olive and citrus trees and we exported fruit and vegetables to the west bank and jordan and to israel now we will be lucky to make 300 from selling the parsley

9289218 but the israelis bulldozed them our land is fertile but we cannot farm here anymore
9289219 my family feels more personally secure in this area now that they the israelis are not shooting and invading our area every day

9289229 demonstrably he has destroyed shareholder value and the board has failed to keep the market properly informed
9289230 when wal king said recently that the project was dead gunns responded by stating that he was misinformed gunns new statement makes it clear wal king was well informed
9289231 the gunns pulp mill is dead with no money no supply or price certainty no plan of action the tasmanian and federal government should put gunns and its long suffering shareholders out of their misery now

9289241 did not lead to their decision to accept the potsdam terms but further contributed to their desperate efforts to terminate the war through moscows mediation indeed soviet attack not the hiroshima bomb convinced political leaders to end the war by accepting the potsdam declaration
9289242 needed japans refusal to justify the use of the atomic bomb thus he could not include the provision providing a constitutional monarchy
9289243 ironically both stalin and truman had vested interests in keeping unconditional surrender no monarchy for different reasons
9289244 would most likely not have prompted the japanese to surrender the war most likely would have ended shortly after soviet entry into the war before november 1
9289245 must bear the responsibility for the wars destructive end more than the american president and the soviet dictator
9289246 and the cells that dont die they turn orange color
9289247 this is one of the most exciting moments in this political season
9289248 shes got every christianist in the country praying that president mccain will have a heart attack on jan 23
9289249 among those who said they shop regularly at wal mart a demographic group that zogby has found to be both
9289250 amen amen i say to you he that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold but climbeth up another way the same is a thief and a robber
9289251 i could no longer study because i dont have a social security number so
9289252 american issues project clearly has struck a nerve inside the obama campaign but even more important is the reaction of the american people who are starting to question
9289253 the heavy handed response of the obama campaign definitely misfired the more the obama campaign has tried to bully the ad off the air with its spurious legal threats and intimidation the more voters have wondered what he has to hide
9289254 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
9289255 declassified records of cabinet and national security council meetings reveal that throughout this period meaning the entire nuclear era when both democratic and republican government leaders discussed civil defense issues their most detailed analysis was of their own special shelters and escape procedures
9289256 the calm and efficient men in the new underground white house
9289257 the soothing illusionary fiction of star wars the largest most costly and greatest civil defense fantasy ever conceived
9289258 differs from previous nuclear civil defense agencies in the increased and unparalleled power it awards to intelligence and police agencies
9289259 that the patronage system asking fans to donate money was a promising idea
9289260 the head of the matter religion is islam its pillar is the prayer and its highest peak is jihad for allahs cause it wouldnt be acquired except by those who are amongst them the muslims
9289261 then fight in allahs cause thou art held responsible only for thyself and rouse the believers to fight
9289262 those words are as if saying do not abandon jihad upon to fight the enemy and be triumphant in the battle against them for the sake of defending the oppressed muslims even if you have to go for jihad alone
9289263 supposing my right hand disputing me i will fight the murtadeen with my left hand
9289264 dont we perform jihad for the sake of islams dignity and the muslims to defend the muslimeen muslimah who are oppressed or if refusing to perform jihad its better to have a sex change plastic operation
9289265 and why should ye not fight in the cause of allah and of those who being weak are ill treated and oppressed
9289266 our lord rescue us from this town whose people are oppressors and raise for us from thee one who will protect and raise for us from thee one who will help
9289267 go ye forth whether equipped lightly or heavily and strive and struggle with your goods and your persons in the cause of allah that is best for you if ye but knew
9289268 when you enter into the inah a kind of riba transaction hold the tails of oxen are pleased with agriculture and give up conducting jihad struggle in the way of allah allah will make disgrace prevail over you and will not withdraw it until you return to your original religion
9289269 no people abandon jihad fie sabilillah except allah will pass on them humiliation and degradation
9289270 unless ye go forth he will punish you with a grievous penalty
9289271 whom he will love as they will love him lowly with the believers mighty against the rejecters fighting in the way of allah and never afraid of the reproaches of such as find fault
9289272 o allah help us over your enemies the enemies of this dienul islam
9289273 based on our discussions it was determined that it would probably be in dr paxtons best interest and the colleges best interest that he resign as president
9289274 john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time
9289275 senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than ninety percent of the time
9289276 i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9289277 we measure progress in the 23 million new jobs that were created when bill clinton was president
9289278 when the average american family saw its income go up 7 500 instead of down 2 000 like it has under george bush
9289279 i will cut taxes cut taxes for 95 percent of all working families because in an economy like this the last thing we should do is raise taxes on the middle class
9289280 washington has been talking about our oil addiction for the last 30 years
9289281 and john mccain has been there for 26 of them in that time hes said no to higher fuel efficiency standards for cars no to investments in renewable energy no to renewable fuels
9289282 today we import triple the amount of oil as the day that senator mccain took office
9289283 i will tap our natural gas reserves invest in clean coal technology and find ways to safely harness nuclear power
9289284 re tool so that the fuel efficient cars of the future are built right here in america
9289285 150 billion over the next decade in affordable renewable sources of energy wind power and solar power and the next generation of biofuels an investment that will lead to new industries and five million new jobs that pay well and cant ever be outsourced
9289286 we are the party of kennedy so dont tell me that democrats wont defend this country dont tell me that democrats wont keep us safe
9289287 as commander in chief i will never hesitate to defend this nation
9289288 but i will only send our troops into harms way with a clear mission and a sacred commitment to give them the equipment they need in battle and the care and benefits they deserve when they come home
9289289 both the tour and the record are going really well were actually ahead of schedule on the record and were now on the home stretch of the tour
9289290 getting immediate reaction from such a large crowd is huge a lot of the people who come to the tour are obviously fans of the show they know these songs and theyre able to sing along its just a really celebratory vibe for all of us
9289291 paula is trying to put a happy face on this situation but she feels very threatened that a younger internationally successful female is joining the cast of judges
9289292 they want another female in case paula misses a taping
9289293 we brought food and ed mcmahon and found our way in
9289294 we got criticized by simon we had a great chat with paula abdul
9289295 simon said i looked good he said he liked my soup he did not like my brownie thankfully he had to speed off to the next location i think i got off the hook
9289296 everyone needs to be told that theyre loved and everyone needs to be shown affection and told that theyre beautiful because i think in todays society especially women as well as men we suffer with such low self esteem and we constantly compare ourselves to other people and other things and want what we dont have and thats just human nature so its nice to really get a message out there that its not about all those things
9289297 seriously they should put that on the poster see me stripped down to my tightie whities how can people not go
9289298 this guy is labeled as a muslim extremist but hes not really so now he has to prove his innocence
9289299 we the people of alaska grateful to god and to those who founded our nation and pioneered this great land
9289300 it is impossible to build an empire without our fathers aid i believe the sacred writings which say that except the lord build the house they labor in vain that build it psalm 127 1
9289301 animated alone by the pure spirit of christianity and conducting ourselves as the faithful subjects of our free government we may enjoy every temporal and spiritual felicity
9289302 can the liberties of a nation be secure when we have removed the conviction that these liberties are the gift of god
9289303 the diffusion of the light of christianity in our nation
9289304 righteousness alone can exalt a nation but sin is a disgrace to any people
9289305 that it is the mutual duty of all to practice christian forebearance love and charity towards each other
9289306 i would call my attorney general in and review every single executive order issued by george bush and overturn those laws or executive decisions that i feel violate the constitution
9289307 overturn those laws or executive decisions that i feel violate the constitution
9289308 i think there are 25 000 individuals that have used offices of powers and they are in our universities and they are in our congresses and they believe in one world government and if you believe in one world government then you are talking about undermining national sovereignty and you are talking about setting up something that you could well call a dictatorship and those plans are there
9289309 the ruling class has the schools and press under its thumb this enables it to sway the emotions of the masses
9289310 the real danger is the gradual erosion of individual liberties through automation integration and interconnection of many small separate record keeping systems each of which alone may seem innocuous even benevolent and wholly justifiable
9289311 childbearing should be a punishable crime against society unless the parents hold a government license all potential parents should be required to use contraceptive chemicals the government issuing antidotes to citizens chosen for childbearing
9289312 its hard to do it when youre on a set where everyones giggling and throwing stuff and making jokes

9289314 can you imagine if i get a serious dramatic role

9289316 i think we both had some scratches and bruises and marks from throwing each other in the ring we definitely both got into it
9289317 parker was so afraid that i was going to find out and i didnt want to make her feel uncomfortable

9289339 it was a miracle that no one inside the home was seriously injured or killed
9289340 there is no question in my mind that if the officers had not arrived when they did this incident would have had a much more tragic conclusion
9289341 people gave the impression we were close when rice was here but its not over we would have a serious problem if we took it to the parliament right now
9289342 these are diversionary tactics to avoid a decision its not a question of negotiating teams its a matter of do you want it or dont you
9289343 they are avoiding the issue they dont want a status of forces agreement they dont want a security agreement
9289344 the talks have reached a critical point now they need a political decision not a technical one
9289345 hamoud had to deal with too many people and then comes to a meeting with the prime minister
9289346 why does he have to change the leaders of the negotiating team and now why we had reached the last part why does he have to change it
9289347 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9289348 sleepwalking into an energy dependence on less stable or reliable partners
9289349 since its foundation more than 50 years ago the e u s prime aim has been that the continent must never again be bloodied by wars of aggression

9289352 shit were busted what do we do now ok take him downtown while we come up with a plan
9289353 after i took the photos the police realized what i was doing and began to shout to me to give them the camera because i was interfering with police work
9289354 despu s que tom las fotos el polic a se dio cuenta y empez a gritarme que le diera la c mara porque yo estaba interfiriendo la labor policial

9289356 i can tune to the open strings on stefanos bass very precisely and also tune scales to the harmonics of each of his open strings
9289357 we begin with the scordatura tuning on stefanos bass that is to what notes he tunes his open strings
9289358 d f g b c d but details of the tuning vary greatly from performance to performance and i sometimes play simultaneously in an other mode say g a b c d f g which although it has most notes in common sets up a tension between my f and stefanos f natural
9289359 i have shown him a lot about the ragas and he has a great intuitive feel for it what is great is that he is able to convey the emotion of the raga whithout having to know all the details this is because in his own improvisation he has a strong relationship to the ways that ragas work
9289360 i just want you to know that your husband is seeing my wife
9289361 i think she is the most inexperienced person on a major party ticket in modern history
9289362 it would be one thing if she had only been governor for a year and a half but prior to that she had not had major experience in public life
9289363 the fact that he would have to go to somebody who is clearly unqualified to be president makes obama look like an elder statesman
9289364 not to belittle alaska but its different than the basket of issues you deal with in big dynamic states
9289365 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9289366 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9289367 the policy of settling international quarrels by admitting and satisfying grievances through rational negotiation and compromise thereby avoiding the resort to an armed conflict which would be expensive bloody and possibly dangerous
9289368 my good friends for the second time in our history a british prime minister has returned from germany bringing peace with honour i believe it is peace for our time
9289369 it is simply giving in to an agressors demands in order to avoid conflict
9289370 just like m14 claimed to have spared lebanon another vicious civil war
9289371 and the cells that dont die they turn orange color
9289372 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9289373 i think there are 25 000 individuals that have used offices of powers and they are in our universities and they are in our congresses and they believe in one world government and if you believe in one world government then you are talking about undermining national sovereignty and you are talking about setting up something that you could well call a dictatorship and those plans are there

9289385 i was so sad and overwhelmed after my last visit the number of children at the food program has increased dramatically as a result of the current food crisis the price of rice is too high people cant afford to eat those who were hungry are now starving i am grateful that weve been able to keep the food program going at its current level to provide thousands of meals each week but so much more is needed to relieve the suffering of course changes in u s foreign and economic policy are needed to create real change in the lives of the poor majority in haiti but little by little through our collaboration with the sainte claires community were providing what fr jean juste calls an islet in the middle of the ocean even through hurricane gustav the cooks at st clares prepared and served meals their devotion and courage inspires me to do all i can on my end to raise the money needed to pay for those meals im hopeful that my book will help raise awareness and inspire people to take action
9289386 it was his toms idea to put my experience in a book his faith in me helped me believe i could do it and im so glad i did
9289387 should enjoy wide readership as more and more of us who do enjoy comparative privilege become aware of how much so many others struggle simply to survive
9289388 when you have a child your life changes in every way in an instant the responsibility level is very high
9289389 ill tell ya she is very special very very special
9289390 my goal was just to try to hit the ball back up the middle i saw it get by him and then i saw superman at second base he made a great play and the rest is history
9289391 we must call attention to the fact that obamas record is enormously thin
9289392 thats what dr king would have asked me to do
9289393 the standard caricature youd see from the old days 50 60 70 years ago black face buckteeth bug eyes holding a watermelon
9289394 it brought back memories of my childhood in ohio where the klan still marched when racism was overt all the name calling i and my family had to endure
9289395 those kinds of characters were very common and id like to see some sensitivity on the part of the county administration to do something about it
9289396 they dont want to offend anybody and will modify the exhibit
9289397 faced the challenge of creating a display to celebrate the strengths of colusa countys agriculture industry while paying homage to the state fairs theme the state fair goes hollywood
9289398 decided to create a display honoring the world traveling seed stars of the county watermelon cucumber pumpkin and tomato
9289399 the boys were assigned the task of drawing caricatures of the seeds characteristic of their ages and this era they drew sharp images worthy of video game or cartoon network debut
9289400 we are saddened that the fine work of these young men is now cast under a cloud of unintended racism
9289401 we ask that you applaud their hard work and know that they were working to honor colusa county with their artistic depiction of a genre of ag products produced in stellar quantities by the county seeds
9289402 harken back for many people particularly the older generation to the period when there were only derogatory images of african americans
9289403 the large toothy smile garish green pants and white minstrel gloves
9289404 a young person oblivious to the history of all of this could have constructed the state fair icon innocently
9289405 interesting how the germans are so bound by the misdeeds of 65 70 years ago

9289439 we did it as some other states did in the case of kosovo and some other problems
9289440 had taken measures where one can discuss whether they were advisable or wise
9289441 had there been such a call from russia i think we should have answered it that option was never put on the table by russia

9289449 estimates show theres more than enough renewables developments either up and running or in the pipeline to potentially meet the 10 per cent goal
9289450 the official said imagine the 2010 target as being part of a pie
9289451 he said small commercial projects were a small part of the pie but it would be big renewables schemes that took up the major share

9289472 wheres their evidence what are they doing obviously theyre just trying to disrupt the protests
9289473 weve known all along that there are people coming to our city who are not planning to conduct themselves in a lawful manner
9289474 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9289475 this is the real deal this is not a test
9289476 one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9289477 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9289478 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok
9289479 there will be immigration people there and were all undocumented
9289480 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9289481 dont worry about traffic or congestion just get on a bike and cruise around
9289482 its going to be a great way to enjoy the convention but larger its a way to make the no 2 bike city in american minneapolis no 1
9289483 i think everybody thinks the same thing it wont happen to me
9289484 all the food borne illnesses that are floating around this country of ours theres anger toward that that canadians have to be subjected to this type of lackadaisical attitude toward food safety
9289485 i want her death to be counted and for people to know this is a real hazard out there
9289486 whether listeria was the actual cause or the underlying cause is very difficult to determine
9289487 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9289488 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9289489 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9289490 an unusually heated attack on a veteran political reporter by a cable news host
9289491 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9289492 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9289493 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency
9289494 governments view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases if it moves tax it if it keeps moving regulate it and if it stops moving subsidize it
9289495 hey welcome to success cough it up before you enjoy it please how dare you succeed
9289496 power our country with 100 percent clean electricity within 10 years
9289497 this goal is so far outside the realm of possibility
9289498 it would be practically infeasible politically impossible and economically and environmentally unwise
9289499 if the political will were there of course it can be done
9289500 weve built up a certain energy infrastructure over the course of 100 years
9289501 its hard to imagine how we would fundamentally redo it over the course of the next ten
9289502 i am personally skeptical that we can fulfill our energy demand needs solely with renewable resources
9289503 this is an issue that is firmly within the grasp of individuals
9289504 a comprehensive review by state wildlife officials of scientific information from a broad range of climate ice and polar bear experts
9289505 its like asking somebody to construct a stadium without giving them a blueprint
9289506 gunns is working towards a financing structure which will not require additional equity to be raised by gunns shareholders
9289507 the process with potential equity parties will take a period of time to work through and gunns does not expect the financing plan to be finalised before the first quarter of 2009
9289508 the financing structure is yet to be finalised and gunns cannot say with any certainty that such a structure will be achievable nor can it provide an assurance that the mill project proceed
9289509 we dont agree on everything but i respect her passion
9289510 im not sure what she brings to the ticket other than shes a woman and a conservative well shes a better speaker than mccain
9289511 people will say she hasnt been on the national scene long enough but i believe shes a quick study
9289512 she was out there with then young son track pulling him around from house to house in a wagon
9289513 i think its great shes a hometown girl from smallville usa
9289514 shes not afraid to speak her mind she really dropped the hammer on the politicians fleecing alaska
9289515 shes an excellent social conservative fiscal conservative and political conservative
9289516 if she can energize the conservative base it wont matter if she gets the womens vote
9289517 this is a really nice person and shes disarming in that way
9289518 she did some housecleaning with her department heads she had to learn about the sewers the libraries public safety
9289519 im still leaning toward obama i think sarah has been really good for our state and it would be wonderful to see her in the white house but shes on the ticket with mccain and i cant vote for mccain
9289520 if it was her running for president thered be no question in my mind
9289521 the republicans right now are about big business and big oil i dont see sarah as a staunch republican in that way
9289522 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness
9289523 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9289524 amy winehouse should have arrived on the site early friday evening we were told by her agent at 8 00 pm that she wasnt coming
9289525 jennifer is in talks to have a guest spot on one of their high profile shows the top choice is 30 rock but if that doesnt work out theyll try to find another show for her to make an appearance on
9289526 just have a little cake with my children and watch some cartoons
9289527 very wise and sage but at the same time very young
9289528 it is not an indication of any health problems it is an effort to be unseen
9289529 no one is planning anything special he is just being quiet these days
9289530 i dont think our celebrities are real hot on how old they are getting why would a pop singer draw attention to the fact they are getting older
9289531 to really still be in the conversation in terms of music sales decades after your career started is the exception not the norm
9289532 it is hard to imagine any album ever dominating the conversation as much as thriller did
9289533 i am doing a great work and i cannot come down why should the work stop while i leave it and come down to you
9289534 making the most of your time because the days are evil
9289535 inspired by both the traditional american high school yearbook and ezra petronios book
9289536 it became clear to us that the amount of time we spent taking care of pennies wasnt valuable in the long run
9289537 they think its a really good idea especially since parliament has been discussing getting rid of the penny its something the country is kind of moving towards
9289538 its something the cafe management thought was really great so were trying it out
9289539 if it continues to go well youll probably see this in our other cafes too
9289540 the prime minister would rather quit his job and break his own fixed election law than get canada moving in the right direction if harper isnt up for the job i am
9289541 labour day provides an opportunity to praise all the men and women who generate the wealth of our nation
9289542 praise all the men and women who generate the wealth of our nation
9289543 there would have been no labour day without the presence of trade unions in our country in western canada lets celebrate the fact that we do have a loyal political ally in every province and territory the new democratic party to join us in celebration theres nothing that stephen harper would rather do if he gains a majority than push through numerous policies that are destructive to working people
9289544 the ongoing international class struggle between the political class tax consumers and the working class taxpayers
9289545 its discrimination against the state of alaska during a time when gas prices are high and we need to look at all options to issue something that shuts off a viable resource
9289546 the amazing thing about this litigation is that the governor of alaska is so anti environmental that she is suing the bush administration over a claimed overabundance of protections for the polar bear
9289547 i think it shows the strength of our legal theory
9289548 basically we said list the polar bear and when you list the polar bear youre going to have to do something about greenhouse gas emissions the fact all these other parties are suing over it shows the bush administration doesnt have a legal leg to stand on they know the administration has to do something about greenhouse gas emissions
9289549 i am afraid that obama is one of those typical asia blind biased politician
9289550 could you imagine barack obama trying to fire an m4
9289551 you cant get beef into japan and korea even though obviously we have the highest safety standards of anybody but they dont want to have that competition from u s producers
9289552 if south korea is selling hundreds of thousands of cars to the united states and we can only sell less than 5 000 in south korea something is wrong
9289553 the president is highly unpopular there doesnt seem to be much excitement around the candidate and theres a real fear of being tagged with the republican label and being seen with george bush
9289554 if the convention wasnt in st paul i wouldnt be at the convention
9289555 the bottom line from this study is that australians think now is the time to adopt a climate change program that has some real teeth
9289556 they believe that climate change will cause serious problems in australia and elsewhere in the world and they understand there will be sizeable cost going along with it
9289557 the lower income houses and seniors very strongly support labors plain to redistribute the income to those households while the middle to high income households clearly support reducing the gst
9289558 the public clearly favours spending 20 per cent of the money on r amp d even though we told them that if they did that they would redistribute less money to the public
9289559 that shows the australians are very forward looking they see it as a long term problem and the r amp d efforts will help them get over the hump
9289560 its discrimination against the state of alaska during a time when gas prices are high and we need to look at all options to issue something that shuts off a viable resource
9289561 the amazing thing about this litigation is that the governor of alaska is so anti environmental that she is suing the bush administration over a claimed overabundance of protections for the polar bear
9289562 i think it shows the strength of our legal theory
9289563 basically we said list the polar bear and when you list the polar bear youre going to have to do something about greenhouse gas emissions the fact all these other parties are suing over it shows the bush administration doesnt have a legal leg to stand on they know the administration has to do something about greenhouse gas emissions
9289564 weve lost our homes weve lost our clothes weve lost everything
9289565 we are taking our children and leaving and we dont even know where we are going
9289566 my hungry children are crying and we are eating raw rice without boiling it
9289567 i know how villagers are somehow managing to keep themselves alive by eating whatever food is available to them
9289568 it is not easy to distribute food to over two million displaced villagers i know their condition
9289569 the knock on the door in the middle of the night
9289570 in the us if you are non white you can immigrate here and instantly be given all kinds of special privileges scholarships and preferences over white americans who have lived here for generations
9289571 for instance why are greeks white and if needed beaten in the streets and turks not
9289572 the president is highly unpopular there doesnt seem to be much excitement around the candidate and theres a real fear of being tagged with the republican label and being seen with george bush
9289573 st paul minn likely gop presidential nominee john mccain and his running mate alaska gov sarah palin are traveling to mississippi on sunday to check on people getting prepared for hurricane gustav advertisement their trip comes just as delegates are preparing for the republican national convention which begins monday aides say mccain and his wife cindy will join palin in traveling to jackson miss sunday at the invitation of mississippi gov haley barbour because of concerns about people threatened by the storm which was heading into the gulf of mexico and menacing the same area ravaged by hurricane katrina three years ago the storm could hit the united states as early as monday afternoon
9289574 caused or contributed to and failed reasonably to mitigate any injury they allegedly have suffered
9289575 when you found out your baby would be born with down syndrome did you consider killing it before or after the due date
9289576 rush just now imagining a series of questions that obama can ask palin if they ever meet
9289577 when you learned that you were going to have a down syndrome baby did you consider aborting it before or after the due date
9289578 there is wide uncertainty about whether shes qualified to be president in the poll taken friday 39 say she is ready to serve as president if needed 33 say she isnt and 29 have no opinion thats the lowest vote of confidence in a running mate since the elder george bush chose then indiana senator dan quayle to join his ticket in 1988 in comparison delaware sen joe biden was seen as qualified by 57 18 after democrat barack obama chose him as a running mate last week
9289579 i thought we played pretty well but we had penalties and turned the ball over
9289580 we werent perfect with our execution and i missed a couple of reads other than that i thought we played well it was good to finally get out here and play in front of our fans it got loud when they called out that we were no 1
9289581 once in the red zone we have to put the ball into the end zone for touchdowns
9289582 we were happy how we played against the no 1 team but a loss is a loss it was a thrill to score a touchdown growing up in georgia it was a dream of mine to score a touchdown in this stadium
9289583 christies auction house has told us 1 5 million is very realistic
9289584 weve been told this piece has more kinds of glass in it and is more intricate than the world record piece
9289585 but whether its at that level we wont know until it sells
9289586 we have a tiffany sale about once each year and the one last december did very very well
9289587 thats the goal and i know local people have been approached
9289588 we have to decide how we can best maximize the value thats there whether its selling to a museum or a local indian tribe or a broker or at auction
9289589 they are not guaranteed if you will to be constructed or certainly not for a while
9289590 they try to pick from that list and spread the money around
9289591 whats happening is congress sometimes gets in the mix and tries to put their favorite little project in there in addition to these and that is where it gets crazy sometimes
9289592 when you grow the force you have to grow infrastructure and support facilities for that force
9289593 its very hard to predict what is going on in those markets 12 18 24 months out folks need to track those on a project by project basis its difficult to generalize about what is going to happen there
9289594 we dont track it a lot but certainly that is one of a fairly small and focused areas where there is growth in nonresidential activity at present and probably will get through this downturn without any scale backs
9289595 all the land prices are going crazy in this area and surrounding areas its nuts
9289596 its a gamble either way the price of corn goes up but the price of everything else is up too
9289597 if youve got a good 80 acres out there its going to bring at least 5 000 dollars an acre and thats an all time high
9289598 that could be another sign that the values could stall
9289599 at some point theres going to be in my humble opinion a turnaround and we have to be ready for that
9289600 when the bubble bursts its extremely painful financially for everybody
9289601 anytime you have commodity prices like this it drives people crazy
9289602 if the weather holds up itll be a great year
9289603 someone once said wings sleep in the dreams of man
9289604 that we know were destined to fly everybody wants to fly
9289605 when i discovered this powered parachute which only flies at 28 miles or so per hour and you fly with your feet
9289606 but the bottoms of my feet start to tingle and i dont like it so i come down most of my photographs are taken between 100 and 500 feet
9289607 you do see things up there particularly at the ends of the day when the light is coming across the earth and leaving enormous shadows hundreds of yards long
9289608 the earth is revealed in a totally different way thats the revelation really is the light
9289609 the red lines are the steering lines theyre attached to the foot bars so i want to make sure that those are ready to go
9289610 and i always wondered what would my life have been like here because this is the only place that i feel at home
9289611 i think that you have to go away to come back to see it with new eyes
9289612 if id grown up here i dont think id be able to see any of this stuff the way i do
9289613 being governor of a small state for less than two years is not consistent with the normal criteria for determining whos of presidential caliber
9289614 a changing environment will affect alaska more than any other state because of our location
9289615 im not one though who would attribute it to being man made
9289616 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9289617 while their policies would take america in the wrong direction governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9289618 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9289619 we thought man it sure would be nice to get deeper into hip hop and merge it with jazz
9289620 we were swinging we realized then we had something going on and the rest is history
9289621 as a band we like to participate in various political activities beyond the music
9289622 the absolutely inconceivable gap between the rich and poor in this country is something we always seem to come back to
9289623 poverty issues are almost always at the heart of anything you can talk about
9289624 one thing that is different about us is that we spend a lot of blood sweat and tears writing music that doesnt just point out was is so messed up about the government and what is so messed up about american society we try hard to get the message out in a positive way and we call for people to rise up not to just be angry
9289625 anger plays a role but it has to be directed towards making the world a better place
9289626 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9289627 typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9289628 i want to ask you if you let imports destroy the garment industry where will people like myself find work how will we be able to provide for our families please understand that we are not asking for special favors we dont want hand outs or welfare all we are asking for is the chance to earn a living it is very hard right now but it is not impossible but if you ignore us the message you will send is that there is no room in the united states for people like myself please vote to save our jobs
9289629 callouses blood sweat and tears are gods way of saying well done
9289630 i thought in the back of my mind yeah their idea of a newsroom was probably based on newsrooms they saw in movies of the 60s but here we were decades later still looking like a newsroom of the 60s
9289631 you could get lost in that building you could hide away in that building
9289632 as we were younger guys starting out it wasnt too uncommon to have to go find somebody who had found another little room we didnt know was there to relax in for a while
9289633 im going to miss this building no two ways about it
9289634 the rolls of paper would come in and they weighed about 1 700 pounds so you had to have a way to get the rolls from the truck to here they came up with this system where theyd put them on carts and push them along
9289635 theyd just pick me and say spray that chute down
9289636 id spray as i was going down to keep it nice and slick so when the papers went down they wouldnt jam up and id come out at the very bottom it was like youre at the village fair zip
9289637 the first time was a little scary i didnt know where i was going to wind up
9289638 the buildings been added to retrofitted and there were so many renovations over the years that any blueprints were pretty much obsolete by the time i came here
9289639 there was one location on the first floor where i had to go through a three foot slate rock wall
9289640 they cant move it its too heavy so we designed the room around it
9289641 it is memories of family trips to the chalky grasslands and woods of newlands corner near guildford
9289642 shes going to learn national security at the foot of the master for the next four years and most doctors think that hell be around at least that long
9289643 she can learn on the job over the next four years you know like night school
9289644 we have to spend a fortune training these college grads after they come to work for us
9289645 ive known mark for 20 years he gave a substantive speech about how we can meet challenges mark has a message of governance and solving problems thats how we win in virginia by rolling up our sleeves and addressing issues that matter to people
9289646 i represent the continuation of the success weve had in virginia its success based on results for regular people in treating virginia as a commonwealth whether youre born in galax or fairfax you should have the same opportunity thats the principle ive been fighting for in the house for 12 years and its why democrats should win this year we have a vision for the country that is for the whole country
9289647 ill run on issues there are sufficient issues to define us hell have to explain his votes the voters will decide now will it involve sharp elbows or a smooth tongue
9289648 ive been traveling the state picking up support ill win because of my demonstrated leadership and work ethic look ive worked in the house in a bipartisan way if house republicans are the impediment to progress ive worked with them just look at alicias law
9289649 ive gone toe to toe against bob mcdonnell for 10 years im going to beat him i wouldnt be in this if i couldnt beat him im positive
9289650 my dad was a football coach he used to say that games are not won on the playing fields of november but on the practice fields of august this isnt just about the governors race virginia democrats are on a roll and were building the party at all levels listen i know you guys at raising kaine have your issues with the governor but as democrats you cant deny that hes done an incredible job building the party helping candidates get elected raising money hiring great people hes building the party in every way while ive been in the house weve gone from 33 delegates to 45 tim kaine is a big part of that and thats something i want to build on
9289651 the next step is reaching deep down ticket helping local offices and doing more for constitutional offices in 2007 democrats took the county boards in loudon montgomery and stafford thats not by accident for example stafford was a really close call it almost didnt happen but then you look at the incredible work of carlos del toros campaign he got out the vote and won the board back for us even though carlos himself didnt win we can run strong everywhere and as governor ill make sure that happens
9289652 i favor a comprehensive energy policy that includes five sources of energy coal nuclear alternative energy sources natural gas and conservation make no mistake conservation is a 5th source as they say the most important gallon of gas is the one you dont use that means leed green initiatives retrofitting commercial buildings and creating residential incentives there are political realities that you have to face but there are a lot of things in conservation that are very doable
9289653 then there are alternatives switchgrass wind solar biomass a big thing we need to pay attention to are private research credits virginia universities are among the best in the nation we could attract huge funding for energy research here
9289654 that includes alternatives but also sequestration congressman boucher is leading on this were sitting on the saudi arabia of coal we cant turn our backs on that but virginia universities and businesses should be the ones figure out how to use it responsibly we can be smart about it the wise plant will be much cleaner than any other plant in commonwealth and allow older plants to go offline energy policy needs to be realistic and comprehensive energy is a challenge but its also a opportunity
9289655 im not one to leave a job unfinished when you make changes you have to make sure they stick and that you can measure the results elections arent an end in themselves theyre a means to an end once you get elected you have to make a real difference and that means fighting all the way through
9289656 its just a way of showing people who fly their flags that we support them
9289657 if you fly a flag well clean it for free
9289658 but dry cleaning definitely will extend the longevity of it
9289659 sometimes we do them behind the post just ourselves sometimes we get scout groups that want us to show them how we do it
9289660 trying to watch all the political stuff i want to be prepared its a big responsibility representing nine counties ive been all over the district to meet people and theyre all so warm and friendly
9289661 im curious to see what its like to be on the floor and have a delegates seat
9289662 i hope to come back with a lot of enthusiasm and ideas on how to support mccains campaign here in illinois
9289663 everybody was friendly and left happy even if their attempt didnt turn out the way they had hoped
9289664 both groups are not for profit organizations who rely heavily on volunteers who appreciate and are interested in horses
9289665 its such a great program that has brought strength balance and fun into my life
9289666 our riders enjoy volunteering because it gives them the best seats in the house
9289667 they get to be up close and personal at the events and gain insight into the previous lives of our program horses
9289668 its unusual to see horses jumping over logs and water
9289669 we have a high population of persons with disabilities senior citizens and lower income individuals who have health problems without the health care to treat those problems its not right for them to have to deal with secondhand smoke
9289670 i think its an extremely wise move for them and their residents
9289671 once one housing authority in a state does this then its likely that others will follow
9289672 once the numbers come in well start working on a policy and maybe making one building smoke free first
9289673 i have to sit with a kleenex over my face because sometimes the smoke coming in is so heavy
9289674 im getting bronchitis from it and my voice goes in and out there are other residents who have breathing problems and heart problems i dont want other people to go through what im going through so im fighting this its for all of us
9289675 twenty percent to 60 percent of the air in apartments comes from other units
9289676 it dilutes itself and gets everywhere theres a lot of ways that air is shared
9289677 the walls turn yellow from all the nicotine and tar
9289678 you have to paint two or three times to cover it everywhere you go its going to cost you more to deal with people that smoke when youre rehabbing units
9289679 they are taking people who cant fight back and bullying them
9289680 its becoming increasingly common and they housing authorities have a perfect right to do so
9289681 its a fire safety thing its a huge health issue i would think that more and more housing authorities would be moving in this direction its very popular to have clean air
9289682 dont argue with an idiot b c they will drag u down to their level and then beat you with experience
9289683 were looking for some place to move i just help with what i have
9289684 i dont want to see a child or anybody be with no food im doing my best to hold back tears for now
9289685 hearing some of the sad stories there are folks here that lost everything that they owned
9289686 that brings the satisfaction as far as trying to help those folks get back on their feet as quickly as possible
9289687 the unrestrained greed of the us leadership and global zionism is gradually leading the world to the edge of a precipice
9289688 it is evident that if such a challenge occurs the fake and artificial regimes will be eliminated before anything
9289689 alex jones has now proven himself to be a first class a number one nut case jerk bag who has to run around with a bullhorn threatening defenseless women michelle malkin with bodily harm it is a shame people like jones are allowed to call themselves journalists when they are not he is a woman hating anarchist and thats all hell ever be alex jones would still be an obscure little nutball no one gave any credence to had it not been for george noory and coast to coast am putting his silly butt in the limelight he owes georege noory an explanation as well as all of his fans which amounts to his mom and dad now i would assume alex you may disagree with other peoples opinions but that does not give you the right to shout them down and threaten them like a wimpy little schoolboy who can only bully girls cant you threaten men your own size alex or are you afraid youll end up being turned into a sissy boy by a real man who doesnt have to shut down a woman with a bullhorn or threaten her with bodily harm to prove hes a man shame on you alex jones you deserve a boyfriend named bubba
9289690 everybody is guarded and ready for additional forecasts people are stocking up on water and non perishable supplies
9289691 provocatuers show up and start a screaming match and alex is blamed
9289692 if you keep piling bullshit on top of bullshit you will eventually bullshit the bullshitters
9289693 an attack against iran would provoke reprisals and israel doesnt have the capability to destroy irans nuclear sites
9289694 iranians assert that their nuclear program has no military nature and an american report which was published recently apparently recognizes their claim
9289695 what tehran wants to tell us i think is that iran is an important player in the region and that we should note it well
9289696 all the countries in the region will pay the price for such a situation
9289697 there is no government in jerusalem that would ever reconcile itself to a nuclear iran
9289698 when it is clear iran is on the verge of acquiring nuclear weapons an israeli military strike to prevent this will be seriously considered

9289706 its kind of a shock i think shes in a little over her head
9289707 but i think of anybody shes the kind of person who can rise to an occasion
9289708 she handles tough questions well its hard to get elected to be a woman and get elected in alaska
9289709 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9289710 i think john mccain won the state of alaska but lost the nation
9289711 i think her inexperience is going to cause many many voters to think twice before voting for him
9289712 i wouldve thought that mccain would go for someone more experienced someone who had been in and out of the country it was a shock
9289713 she seems like she cares about the common law man i feel like she cares about me
9289714 i know her character and i know she has integrity
9289715 shes driven motivated shes a strong person and because of all that i knew she wasnt going to stop with our little town
9289716 if you went to city council meetings and i went to a lot of them she didnt make a quick decision
9289717 rather than bending to the old folks the people who were the status quo the people whod made decisions for years she did what was in the best interests of the people
9289718 itll be interesting to see how much she learns between now and then how much they teach her
9289719 they say shes a quick study because no one thought she was ready to be governor
9289720 because ive seen the family i know they work very hard and they help the community just the same by working on peoples cars and sometimes they do it for free just because
9289721 the whole community is coming the whole people is coming the american guys are great i dont know how to explain it to you i just dont know how to explain
9289722 but probably a couple of months before he is ready to get out of the hospital

9289725 i heard there was a free concert my family and i are traveling missionaries and so we stopped by and they said we could use help we could you volunteers so we started volunteering

9289727 as you can see they have about 1 2 the road ripped up here and we knew we needed to organize the move in process keep it convenient for families and keep people off this part of town

9289749 people dont realise just how far ahead of the game that he is the ability to project 5 10 years ahead to the betterment of the team the moaners doomsayers and so called realists have both seriously underestimated the effect of the hundreds and millions poured into chelsea and manchester united whilst believing that a strategy of signing a few experienced players will be enough to combat them
9289750 when questioned the sceptics do a hasty backtrack and you say we dont need galacticos just a few judicious signings we just need the dm or the cm ok can understand this point if it wasnt for the vitriol of abuse that preceded it let me use a phrase that sums up this crowd glory hunters

9289798 typically online communities are criticized for promoting disembodied and immaterial connections too often political campaigns that may once have mobilized a street action or something directly physical have instead turned into a cascade of emails and online petitions but as the remarkable participation in the february 2003 global anti war demonstrations revealed the same electronic communities can network themselves to produce an unprecedented public demonstration

9289808 compromise is often necessary but it ought not to originate with environmental leaders our role is to hold fast to what we believe is right to fight for it to find allies and to adduce all possible arguments for our cause if we cannot find enough vigor in us or our friends to win then let someone else propose the compromise which we must then work hard to coax our way we thus become a nucleus around which activists can build and function

9289828 people already pay taxes no extra money is necessary to keep the toilets clean
9289829 in this way restrooms which are supposed to be cleaned in shifts will be more hygienic and clean and satisfy peoples needs
9289830 the management of the toilets should be overseen by the womens cooperative union and handicapped people should be given preference in hiring as the managers of these restrooms as it is in korea
9289831 they act as if this is the last issue to be dealt with
9289832 if we get to jan 9 without reaching an agreement that would end the state of schism then we would certainly be heading to a new chapter of conflict that will be more tragic
9289833 the inspection boards are dysfunctional governments are audited by the people that they appoint an inspector is expected to inspect a minister undersecretary deputy undersecretary or general manager such an inspection does not produce reliable results suppose that inspection has been conducted properly if during this inspection an irregularity is found the minister decides whether it should be prosecuted or not for this reason corrupt practices performed in the current period cannot be identified only those performed in the term of the previous government can be found
9289834 turkey should ensure the autonomy of its auditing mechanisms otherwise we cannot prevent fraud and corruption
9289835 this law is exempt from the provisions of the public procurement law
9289836 we as the chp will propose an independent and autonomous audit system as currently charges of corruption cannot be properly prosecuted due to a defective expert opinion system
9289837 governments just pretend to prevent corruption symbolic corruption cases are offered to create sensation or big impact while large scale corrupt practices are conducted behind the scenes
9289838 the state and bureaucracy are involved in some part of all corruption cases in turkey governments tolerate the bureaucrats appointed by them when they are accused of corruption lack of a proper registration system nurtures corruption and vice versa
9289839 auditing should not be left to the whims of politicians or bureaucrats this government wants to eliminate even the inspection boards cases of corruption are accidentally uncovered this is just the tip of the iceberg
9289840 the commission attaches great importance to turkeys anti corruption policies a new project titled the ethical project for prevention of corruption is being implemented in turkey under this project public institutions local authorities nongovernmental organizations and universities will work together in order to promote an ethical culture not only centrally but also throughout rural turkey

9289844 gov palin understands what it takes to lead our nation and she understands the importance of supporting our troops
9289845 shes exactly who this country needs to help me fight the same old washington politics of me first and washington second
9289846 in terms of the tough measures nato is considering for russia possibilities are growing that ankara may end up alienated from the west
9289847 the cooperation and understanding between the turkish armed forces tsk and the us armed forces before execution of these operations as well as during execution of these operations are at an excellent level because of this reason one of our important duties is protection of this cooperation
9289848 turkeys relations with the us are so wide and comprehensive that they cannot be linked to a certain issue
9289849 ba bu s remarks have a very important message and answer my question to a large extent now we comprehend that there is no intention for getting involved in disagreements with either the us or nato
9289850 if the nato ships continue to stay in the black sea after the expiration of the 21 day period then i would like to remind you that turkey would be responsible
9289851 is under the responsibility of all the countries that signed the international convention
9289852 the naval forces commanders response to russia is also very important it is the first time that russia has been given such a blunt warning by turkey it occurred to me that if turkey falls into a situation in which it will have to side with a camp then russia may encounter a bloc that it hadnt at all expected to encounter
9289853 turkey will side with its traditional bloc this is what i see more clearly than a few days ago in the light of the messages given by the top commanders
9289854 the turkish government has tried to maintain a delicate balance by keeping a low profile in its reactions but it had to do so and if a circle tries to put turkey into a corner by saying that its reactions were rather weak then turkey can easily show its signature under natos statement regarding russia
9289855 although the matching of the timing of the two incidents is coincidence one can look at what ba bu said concerning the us and the video released on the ankaya presidential palaces web site making a guess as to which side turkey will remain on what ba bu said is almost the same as what atat rk said at the time
9289856 i have no doubt that american nation is together with the turkish nation
9289857 side with the united states its nato ally and let more us military ships into the black sea to assist georgia or whether it would choose russia
9289858 where is turkey headed turkish officials say they are using their trust based relations with various sides to act as a mediator between various parties in the region the us and iran israel and syria pakistan and afghanistan etc it may be so but as more american ships steam toward the black sea a time for choosing has arrived
9289859 turkey decided its camp at least half a century ago and it remained committed to this decision
9289860 turkey is not in a position to make a decision between russia and the us and the eu fine there are improved mostly commercial relations with russia based on neighborhood yes turkey has contact with russia but this contact cannot be compared to its relationship with the west to which it is connected with political and economical ties in any event neither its foreign policy which is a state policy nor its economical formation allows turkey to depart from its current path
9289861 besides those who seek different paths than the current one have been imprisoned now
9289862 although it is purely a coincidence it is still meaningful at a time when those who suggest that turkey should build a bloc with russia and iran are being investigated russia has chosen a different path this is all coincidence but if we turn back to the issue turkeys direction is obvious which is cooperation with the us and the eu
9289863 of course turkey will experience certain difficulties with russia which is already aware of turkeys choice due to this awareness russia is already antagonizing turkey via the truck issue
9289864 turkeys place is obvious but due to its delicate position of course it has been maintaining a careful stance via keeping a low profile in its reactions
9289865 the russian invasion of georgia is a stark reminder of the unsettled nature of the turkish geopolitical scene by all indications the crisis in georgia is unlikely to end anytime soon even if russian forces withdraw to negotiated positions there is every prospect for a sustained russian political and security presence in the country under these conditions ankara will once again face russian power directly on its borders in the near term turkey will face difficult policy choices in reconciling the countrys russian and western interests even more difficult dilemmas are on the horizon as a more competitive relationship with russia looms and nato is compelled to rethink its own strategy and posture
9289866 these are speculations that are not at all compatible with reality at the time even commissioned officers within the army suggested that turkey should constitute a new bloc with russia and iran however as happened these are destined to remain solely as speculations without any reasonable ground vis vis turkeys history and foreign policy principles
9289867 in the first place such a perception stemmed from certain difficulties concerning the us will to send humanitarian aid to georgians via navy ships passing through the turkish straits but the difficulties were presented by media as more serious than they actually were
9289868 the information regarding the us request to send two hospital ships to georgia was not true no official request was conveyed however it is true that the us side checked the ground for such a possibility and when they saw that turkey was firm as regards implementation of the montreux convention they chose the appropriate method for sending humanitarian aid by obeying the terms of montreux the two sides arrived this point and found a formula for sorting the issue out via mutual understanding
9289869 nevertheless there is the possibility of a growth of this crisis in the upcoming period and then turkey may have to take a firmer position between the west and russia in case of such crisis which will bring a structural transformation in the global balances of course we will be seeing a brand new situation with growing reaction in the west against russia in this case relations between turkey and russia will inevitably sustain an injury turkey will not be able to assume a bilateral relationship with russia as usual and as if nothing happened
9289870 on sept 1 at the eu meeting the leaders will probably make decisions for certain precautions against russia when these precautions come into force then turkey will have to display more clearly to which camp it feels it belongs
9289871 in the first place the us congress will have a hard time vis vis approving a pending resolution for official recognition of armenian allegations of genocide when there is such a tense environment in the caucasus in addition to armenias close relations with russia the us congress will have to thoroughly think about whether the approval of such resolution makes sense
9289872 john mccain has made clear from the start that he wants to change washington and he proved it today by going as far away from washington as possible in selecting his running mate eighty eight years after our nations women first gained the right to vote this selection demonstrates how far our nation has come
9289873 gov palins views align with sen mccains own stated position that human life is precious and must be protected this selection by sen mccain is a very encouraging sign for his campaign
9289874 governor palin is a great choice and she has already captured the female vote we needed to win
9289875 i believe that in order to make government work better it must include both strong men and women with this historic choice sen mccain has clearly shown his and the republican partys commitment to including every voice in our society
9289876 this is a bold and exciting pick that demonstrates the republican party is focused on the future and changing how washington d c does business as an outsider gov palin has a solid record of making government work better including fighting for landmark ethics reform
9289877 gov palin is a strong conservative with executive experience who has cut wasteful spending opposed earmarks and shown courage in taking on corruption in her own party
9289878 theyre conservatives going to be excited about this pick because heres an authentic person who believes and does what she says in her policy atmosphere and can authentically carry that message to the country
9289879 gov palin is a conservative republican with a track record of reforming government she will strengthen sen mccains appeal to reagan democrats and supporters of sen hillary clinton who are looking for a president who has the experience and temperament to be commander in chief
9289880 shes tough shes tenacious i believe that she does have what it takes to get out there again her ability to connect with voters and make a case is very very very strong
9289881 should she be spending this much time away from her kids to run for vice president can she really do both
9289882 how can she do this to her children she should be home
9289883 after 19 months of traversing this country traveling to every state except alaska which now that i think about it im gonna have to go up there now
9289884 she seems to have a wonderful engaging personality and you know the fact that she got elected governor of alaska i think shows shes got real political skill
9289885 i think you guys can take a look at gov palins record and joe bidens record and make your own judgments in terms of who you think has what it takes to be an outstanding vice president
9289886 katrina is the worst storm that ever hit it wasnt the worst storm that could have hit

9289913 surprised to see scott young lose his job since he did have a strong preseason
9289914 you can kill them with this for they can no more obey their own rules than the christian church can live up to christianity
9289915 if your people arent having a ball doing it there is something very wrong with the tactic
9289916 the major premise for tactics is the development of operations that will maintain a constant pressure upon the opposition it is this that will cause the opposition to react to your advantage

9289918 when i was 14 my dad beat me so i stole a hundred lira from my mothers purse and left id never been in a car before but i stood by the road and hitched a lift with a lorry driver he took me to erzurum i meant to stay but was swindled out of my money i walked for three days to artvin and bumped into some men i knew on a building site there i stayed for three months then paid my way to bursa after three or four years here as a washer up i had enough money to move to stanbul
9289919 i hadnt done that job before but i thought i could manage
9289920 they came swarming over the sides of the boat like pirates and we argued they were angry about my littering and i was defiant about what id done they beat me up of course they were right but i was too ignorant at that time to think about my actions or their consequences
9289921 i had bought some chain and was getting ready to chain myself to the railing when some russians ran up and tried to cosh me i left but knew something still had to be done the animals were sick with fungus and stressed by the unfamiliar sea water and marina noise
9289922 by the third or fourth day i was weak and becoming delirious i was only drinking water or tea and smoking cigarettes the police came to try and take me away but tourists stopped them they even had candlelight vigils to support me
9289923 it was the little finger of my right hand which as you can see is a little crippled anyway
9289924 they were using the environment to garner popularity and kudos for themselves not because they actually cared
9289925 were going to try to get this into your bladder
9289926 ow no its not amp working no amp arrrrgh no more amp tries clean that up and leave me alone
9289927 we have nothing to gain let someone else pay him for what hes actually contributed

9289935 the welcoming committee is a criminal enterprise made up of 35 anarchists who are intent on committing criminal acts before and during the republican national convention
9289936 these acts include tactics to blockade and disable delegate buses breaching venue security and injuring police officers they have recruited assistance in their criminal conspiracy from other anarchists groups throughout the country through their plans and actions they have exhibited a blatant disregard for the law and the safety of others

9289948 obviously it was not the result we were looking for but it is the effort were looking for
9289949 we played some good teams this weekend and they exposed our weaknesses
9289950 this gives us a reference point of where we need to improve next week were looking forward to getting back in the gym and building on this last match and moving forward as a program

9289952 they western illinois played us a lot closer than we anticipated
9289953 hats off to their players and coaches for coming in here and fighting and our thoughts and prayers certainly go out to coach don patterson
9289954 we had some problems with that tonight wiu executed their game plan well we just had to fight through it
9289955 we knew that we had to pull this one out well take this game and we will learn from it i think we will grow as a team
9289956 weve been preaching the run to him especially with the look western illinois was giving us

9289958 gregs heart aches and breaks for everybody affected by his involvement with the bonds case including and especially his wife
9289959 the whole thing continues to be a lesson in misery
9289960 will never testify he will never cooperate with the government he doesnt trust them
9289961 i dont know what impact that might have had she would have no marital privileges then
9289962 as it stands the government is looking at anyone they can who is connected to this case
9289963 a spouse cannot be compelled to testify against a spouse in court although each spouse can waive that right and there is a confidential communications privilege where a conversation between a husband and wife cannot be disclosed in a court of law
9289964 either spouse has the right to object to such conversations being used in a case
9289965 wanted to say greg told me he provided barry bonds with steroids then gregs attorney could block that and say that was a private conversation
9289966 what happened in georgia is a good sign one that means america is no longer the sole world power setting the rules of the game
9289967 there is a balance in the world now russia is resurging which is good for us for the entire middle east
9289968 definitely rising concern russia may go ahead and deliver those systems as a way of further indicating how unhappy it is with u s policy
9289969 defensive character that do not violate the strategic balance of power in the middle east
9289970 all that ended up to be a kind of nostalgia or looking for a new kind of cold war when there was not only one single power dominating the world the united states and its ally israel
9289971 theres a realization that russia has a lot of interests with the west also that russia is still a limited power
9289972 its no match there is no new cold war coming
9289973 americans like risk takers but they also want to know that in times of crisis youre going to be calm
9289974 but it also speaks to a very hyper political decision obviously he doesnt have any history with sarah palin he doesnt know her it seems to be a calculated push toward gaining women voters
9289975 but were talking about somebody who is 72 running for president and i dont know if you gamble with those decisions do you its not like he was 20 points behind
9289976 the governors decision was clearly based on politics not on science and was primarily designed to protect the oil and gas industry stampede into the arctic ocean
9289977 one stop shop online do everything photographic site a veritable swiss army knife of a site ephotozine has everything a photographer could wish for
9289978 governor palin has been fully cooperative in this situation and has nothing to hide she has been a leader and proven reformer demanding accountability and transparency from alaskas government which resulted in landmark ethics legislation
9289979 i think hes emotionally committed in trying to see that his former brother in law is punished
9289980 i do now have to tell alaskans that such pressure could have been perceived to exist although i have only now become aware of it
9289981 really likes walt a lot but on this issue she doesnt know why there is absolutely no action for a year on this issue its very very troubling to her and the family
9289982 it goes well beyond the fact that she is under a cloud of ethics investigations shes fired the only commissioner who dared to stand up and say we need to do more to make alaska safe
9289983 i am not and dont want to come across as a disgruntled employee
9289984 i was trying to protect her when i was let go i was a little surprised there was not a warning shot or anything
9289985 he asked me to look into it so i told them i would
9289986 i had it compared with the internal investigations file there was no new evidence no new complaints
9289987 i explained to her there was no new evidence the issue was closed
9289988 as we were walking down the stairs in the capitol building
9289989 she wanted to talk to me about her former brother in law i said maam i need to keep you at arms length with this i cant deal about him with you if need be i can talk to todd
9289990 ed im sorry about the problems but i cant do much as i am somewhere in the middle of the caribbean i have absolutely no clue where
9289991 we are not the first to make dna tubes with controlled circumferences however compared with previous approaches our method is distinctively simple and modular
9289992 the simplicity of the single stranded tile approach promises to enable us to design ever more complex self assembling molecular systems the work is simultaneously elegant and useful
9289993 vandread which finished airing at the end of last year
9289994 vandread 2 character designs we see here were part of a project which was later scrapped in favor of second stage the text of the article treats it as a rumor so it cant have been very far along
