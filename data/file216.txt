2160007 the risk that saddam husseins iraq was thought to pose to the nation still reeling from the attacks of 9 11
2160008 saddam hussein forced the question should we leave him in place and hope for the best or destroy his regime in a lightning strike and thereby end the risk that he might collaborate with terrorists to enable an attack even more devastating than 9 11
2160009 twenty five million iraqis had been liberated and the menace of saddams monstrous regime eliminated

2160057 going by the turnout in the hall i was able to gauge that the bn has the support of the people in machap
2160058 furthermore when i announced the name of the candidate the response was overwhelming and this is a very good sign of the acceptance of the voters in this constituency
2160059 this gives the bn confidence that the candidate selected is the best and a favourite among the voters who can fulfil their aspirations
2160060 he has proven his capabilities and is humble and simple in his approaches he has been effective in serving the people here
2160061 i believe we will do better but our machinery must work hard and take to the ground in full force to meet the voters regardless of their race we should work as a team in the spirit of bn which is united as a family
2160062 we have not set any target but we want a better majority
2160063 we will go all out to get as many votes as possible while assuring the people that each of their problems will be attended to
2160064 and we will continue serving the people and on top of that bring more development to machap and its people
2160065 i urge the people here who are all basically my friends to support bn as only this will enable me to continue to work and resolve their problems and bring development to machap
2160066 i am confident the people will support me and in return i will dedicate my service to them if i am elected
2160067 we encounter problems building houses especially low cost houses in machap as this is a water catchment area and any development would have to be studied carefully as we do not want the states main source of water to be polluted
2160068 i will do my best to bring in more housing projects with help from the chief minister i am sure there is a way around this and knowing the bn government the needs of the people will never be neglected

2160101 if the rich literature of hadith is assumed a splendid collection of pearls sahih of imam al bukhari is rightfully privileged to be called a gigantic ocean serenely flowing for the providence and safeguard of those precious pieces of magnificence a vast yet shoreless ocean having lavishly quenched the thirst of many it is unanimously held in the high esteem of being the most authentic book after the book of allah by advocates and adversaries alike

2160106 ibn hajar frequently uses the kushmayhani variant as his standard text but gives his reasons often in complex detail for preferring other readings where these seem to have particular merit in doing this he makes it clear that he is authorised through the ijaza system for all the riwayat he cites
2160107 there are few hadith which can be understood adequately without reference to the often complex debates which have taken place concerning them between the scholars

2160258 on july 26 1970 carl bernard hampton one of black americas most articulate courageous and heroic young leaders was ruthlessly slain by the houston police departments criminal intelligence division at the age of 21 carl was a tireless organizer who worked day and night armed with determination to see his people free from the oppression exploitation and degradation by a racist and corrupt system bent on the destruction of blacks and people of color he rallied people around the issue of police brutality and murder speaking with much power and authority he was able to capture the hearts and minds of the people and therefore their respect and admiration
2160259 maybe you had to die for what you stood for you were an intelligent young man and devoted to your people so i shall close carl and hope you didnt die for no reason i shall close with my tear stained eyes for i loved you so good night carl hampton although i just met you one time good night your 30 minute friend and brother although you didnt know my name but you knew my face goodbye

2160266 this needs to be brought out we dont need a monument or a symbol but some serious work in the community as we were gathering tonight a man was in the dumpster looking for a meal across the street from where carl was shot i saw that people are camping and living in the empty lot the brother gave his life so that all could have a place to stay and clothes on their backs and good food to eat the very issues that carl struggled around and gave his life for still need addressing this is a human struggle and carl is a legacy of that struggle we want to keep this struggle alive

2160386 with boundless erudition and in delightfully clear prose surowiecki ranges across fields as diverse as popular culture psychology ant biology behavioral economics artificial intelligence military history and politics to show how this simple idea offers important lessons for how we live our lives select our leaders run our companies and think about our world
2160387 possibly the most innovative and devastating retailer in the world
2160388 the important thing for employees to keep in mind then is that they are working for their company not for their division enron took exactly the opposite tack emphasizing competition between divisions and encouraging people to steal talent resources and even equipment from their supposed comrades this is reminiscent of the bad old days at companies like gm where the rivalries between different departments were often stronger than those between the companies and their outside competitors the beneficial effects of competition are undeniable but serious internal rivalries defeat the purpose of having a company with a formal organization in the first place by diminishing economies of scale and actually increasing the cost of monitoring peoples behavior you should be able to trust your fellow workers more than you trust workers at other firms but at a company like enron you couldnt and because the competition is artificial since people are competing for internal resources not in a real market the supposed gains in efficiency are usually an illusion as is the case today with americas intelligence community decentralization only works if everyone is playing on the same page
2160389 for all that though the solutions to cooperation and coordination problems are real in the sense that they work they are not imposed from above but emerge from the crowd and on the whole they are better solutions than any group of platonic guardians could come up with and this is how we might think of democracy too it is not a way of solving cognition problems or a mechanism of revealing the public interest but it is a way of dealing with if not solving once and for all the most fundamental problems of coordination and cooperation how do we live together how can living together work to our mutual benefit democracy helps people answer those questions because the democratic experience is an experience of not getting everything you want its an experience of seeing your opponents win and get what you hoped to have and of accepting it because you believe they will not destroy the things you value an d because you know you will have another chance to get what you want in that sense a healthy democracy inculcates the virtues of compromise which is after all the foundation of the social cotntract and change the decisions that democracies make may not demonstrate the wisdom of the crowd the decision to make them democratically does

2160432 gingrich also acknowledged cheating on ginther his former wife while leading the impeachment proceedings against president clinton for allegations of perjury involving the paula jones sexual harassment civil case and the presidents affair with monica lewinsky
2160433 gingrich argued that the clinton case was different from his personal transgressions
2160434 the president of the united states got in trouble for committing a felony in front of a sitting federal judge he said arguing that clinton had deliberately committed perjury
2160435 because he had been through a divorce gingrich said he knew the importance of telling the truth during a deposition
2160436 the standard is in a court of law should somebody whos popular get away with perjury
2160437 and i drew a line in my mind that said even though i run the risk of being deeply embarrassed and even though at a purely personal level i am not rendering judgment on another human being as a leader of the government trying to uphold the rule of law i have no choice except to move forward and say that you cannot accept felonies and you cannot accept perjury in your highest officials
2160438 its worth noting that gingrich did not limit his comments about clinton and the democrats to legalistic allegations of perjury
2160439 constantly espousing family values even while he carried on an affair gingrich linked his party to wholesome family values and democrats to well something else
2160440 we cry for the ones who break our hearts because we loved them much

2160461 meeklejon if this message is reaching you then ive managed to work miracles as my entire communication network is down as hard as this will be for you to believe peter mctaggart has stolen my sorceress powers i am effectively powerless in every way hes got some kind of new power that allows him to literally extract all the power from any one individual hes on his way to northdale having already been to lumeria and vixlorn alyssa and andrew are dead as are all the citizens of the country of lumeria i dont know what hes planning but its pretty serious im sorry i cant offer any further help

2160471 you know for a building with some of the most advanced technology in the world why oh why do we not get anything decent on the tv
2160472 excellent set the status of the building to red alert and make sure two squads intercept the meeklejon teams before they reach the hangar bay and the laboratory
2160473 three there are three squads on intercept patterns the meeklejon leader gary is headed straight for this chamber
2160474 call the third team off i can handle gary myself besides its been so long since we last met
2160475 you are under orders to call off the third security squad dismissed
2160476 jamie is no longer senior staff since his little stunt that almost got him killed and neo is in genoan with roslyn at the moment gary should be here any moment
2160477 kyle and i saw this and thought you should all see it with your own eyes
2160478 welcome to channel 49 afternoon news a fighter jet entered the airspace around magdinvale earlier today and would not declare its intent despite several attempts at communications the jet careened into the mid section of the magdinvale palace less than an hour ago killing hundreds of employees it has now been confirmed that the jet originated from meeklejon headquarters sparking fears that the rebel group have declared war on the country of magdinvale the northern hemisphere is only just beginning to recover from the onslaught of meeklejon several months ago initial reports indicate that the president and leader of the world summit mr peter mctaggart is still inside the building but is unharmed the intent of this attack is still unclear
2160479 rebel group exactly where do they get their facts from
2160480 you know everyones still edgy after what happened when meeklejon were captured and brainwashed 3 months ago
2160481 excuse me did you say gary i thought you said he was on his way
2160482 im going to call our allies and see what damage control we can do
2160483 so long as none of you assault any other countries i really dont care
2160484 re call any personnel that are out in glasgow this could get nasty
2160485 this isnt funny peter youre a monster a month for one long month youve had robin under lock and key doing who knows what to him you even had the audacity to have that wretch nina pose as him all the while
2160486 the hatred for your little clique of meeklejon is growing by the day its only a matter of time until your threat is eliminated
2160487 the world will see the truth sooner or later we still have northdale genoa lumeria vixlorn and moroda on our side
2160488 hah compared to the number backing me that is pitiful the tables have turned mr brown you cant stop the coming onslaught
2160489 meeklejon are more than prepared for whatever is coming you took my friend from me twice im through forgiving people nina tried to play that card we dont need to worry about her anymore say goodbye mr mctaggart your story ends here
2160490 hes falling in and out of consciousness i dont know what else we can do

2160499 from next year we will offer franchise of teams like in the ipl to interested companies and individuals and work has already begun in this direction

2160501 the fact is that twenty20 leagues are now a popular form of cricket and we dont want to lag behind other countries in this regard

2160503 the absolute weight doesnt matter it depends on how long you try to hold it if i hold it for a minute thats not a problem if i hold it for an hour ill have an ache in my right arm if i hold it for a day youll have to call an ambulance
2160504 in each case its the same weight but the longer i hold it the heavier it becomes
2160505 and thats the way it is with stress management if we carry our burdens all the time sooner or later as the burden becomes increasingly heavy we wont be able to carry on
2160506 as with the glass of water you have to put it down for a while and rest before holding it again when were refreshed we can carry on with the burden
2160507 so before you return home tonight put the burden of work life down dont carry it home you can pick it up tomorrow
2160508 whatever burdens youre carrying now let them down for a moment if you can

2160532 you just seem a little off dude plus you havent used you powers much in the past month
2160533 well you know im still not too sure about them after all how would you feel if someone forced you to have weird magic powers gary
2160534 hah robin you clearly are delirious you know for a fact that i got my powers in a highly similar way i get the feeling somethings up though
2160535 you know robin i think theres a spy amongst us john and rory have just this minute managed to stop someone from stealing information regarding our shields
2160536 what are you going to do exactly ive already sent bucketloads of information regarding the majority of the meeklejon team to peter
2160537 i couldnt care less right now tell me what youve done with robin
2160538 as i said hes probably dead i swapped places with him when he was shot out of the sky peter wanted to finish what he started in the southern expanse you see
2160539 well since youll never let me go until i tell you matthew malone and peter intercepted robin and kathleen after they were shot dead three years ago kathleen never made it but they were able to save robin malone corp had managed to synthesize a fluid that could allow the host to absorb any power or essence of any other individual that they touched they kept this fluid inside robin mccabe for safe keeping however malone shut the operation down before peter could see it through the end
2160540 he didnt know how it worked besides peter will have extracted it already theres nothing you can do
2160541 well see about that tell me where hes being kept
2160542 youll never reach him how many times do i have to tell you that hes being held in the presidents high security office in magdinvale city
2160543 right i want you to tell me everything i wanna know how to get in where to shut off the palaces shields etc
2160544 you have got to be kidding me on why would i tell you all that meeklejon dont kill anyone remember

2160551 i couldnt care less about what you think anymore nina my friend has endured enough torture over the past three years without needing another month of it all
2160552 see you cant even bring yourself to kill me youre a loser now just as you were three years ago you couldve saved robin back then you couldve stopped peter matt and me as well but you didnt youre all a bunch of losers and you gary youre the biggest loser of them all

2160557 i think its all because of one day cricket its hard to get spinners of that quality because you dont play that many three day or four day games you need to develop your game you are only bowling ten or eight overs or less in the shortened game so the development of a spinner is tough
2160558 i played a lot of three day and four day cricket and you learn by bowling 30 overs you try and learn while bowling those spells thats the reason i have actually enjoyed bowling even when there is nothing in the match
2160559 just bowling a spell where i start learning about my game its about saying what are the things that i can do if i come across this situation again so thats the learning process that probably doesnt happen these days for the younger lot
2160560 well have to prepare wickets for spinners the emphasis now is definitely on fast bowlers but we need to create turning wickets
2160561 if the first ball of a test match seams and swings then it is a good wicket whats wrong if the first ball spins

2160577 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2160578 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2160579 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2160580 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2160581 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2160582 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2160583 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2160584 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2160585 here put these on no one will know and were going to be late if you dont hurry up

2161080 the ownership of money and property comes as a result of doing things in a certain way those who do things in this certain way whether on purpose or accidentally get rich those who do not do things in this certain way no matter how hard they work or how able they are remain poor it is a natural law that like causes always produce like effects therefore any man or woman who learns to do things in this certain way will infallibly get rich
2161081 this is the biggest type of discrimination practised by the government
2161082 the government does not recognise the contribution of those educated under the indonesian system to the struggle for independence
2161083 why do we have to use portuguese portuguese speaking countries are poor and they are far from us
2161084 i dont know any portuguese id rather learn english than portuguese
2161085 most of our textbooks are in indonesian and most lecturers dont speak portuguese
2161086 this is going to be a big problem these students dont speak indonesian and their teachers dont know portuguese
2161087 anyone with the slightest familiarity with east timors history knows that the portuguese language has long been central to the national identity
2161088 east timor needs both tetum and portuguese to be fully itself
2161089 this policy of imposing a foreign language will not work i doubt that in 50 years the government will be able to make the whole nation proficient in portuguese

2161099 the historian should be fearless and incorruptible a man of independence loving frankness and truth one who as the poets says calls a fig a fig and a spade a spade he should yield to neither hatred nor affection not should be unsparing and unpitying he should be neither shy nor deprecating but an impartial judge giving each side all it deserves but no more he should know in his writing no country and no city he should bow to no authority and acknowledge no king he should never consider what this or that man will think but should state the facts as they really occurred

2161171 when things in your lives seem almost too much to handle when 24 hours in a day are not enough remember the mayonnaise jar and the 2 cups of coffee
2161172 a professor stood before his philosophy class and had some items in front of him when the class began he wordlessly picked up a very large and empty mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with golf balls he then asked the students if the jar was full they agreed that it was
2161173 i want you to recognize that this jar represents your life the golf balls are the important things your family your children your health your friends and your favorite passions and if everything else was lost and only they remained your life would still be full
2161174 there is no room for the pebbles or the golf balls the same goes for life if you spend all your time and energy on the small stuff you will never have room for the things that are important to you
2161175 pay attention to the things that are critical to your happiness play with your children take time to get medical checkups take your spouse out to dinner play another 18 there will always be time to clean the house and fix the disposal take care of the golf balls first the things that really matter set your priorities the rest is just sand
2161176 it just goes to show you that no matter how full your life may seem theres always room for a couple of cups of coffee with a friend

2161181 the current council lacks responsiveness to urgent issues this is largely due to the constant restructuring and downsizing of council staff which has reduced the capacity to respond in a timely manner the loss of standing committees has also reduced the opportunity for the public to get action if elected we will work hard towards creating a more engaged and accessible city council
2161182 i am delighted to win the christchurch 2021 nomination for council alongside linda rutland together we will make a solid team who are energetic and experienced on community issues and city council politics we offer voters a positive choice for councillors who are committed to representing the needs and concerns of local people

2161248 through october georgias best chance for widespread drought relief will be tropical disturbances
2161249 but the heart of the tropical storm season is still a few weeks away
2161250 exceptional drought has returned to northeast georgia and continuing dry weather has spread drought conditions to southeast georgia
2161251 across northeast and southwest georgia almost all streams were at or near record low flows for late july
2161252 many streams were below the 7q10 level of flow the seven refers to the seven day stream flow the q is quantity and the 10 refers to 10 years
2161253 thus the current 7q10 level is the lowest consecutive seven day stream flow expected to occur once in 10 years
2161254 when stream flows fall below the 7q10 value there are concerns about environmental quality and a streams health it is very common for streamwithdrawal and discharge permits to be based on 7q10
2161255 the chattahoochee and chestatee rivers are the main sources of water for lake lanier
2161256 lanier hartwell and clarks hill reservoirs remained near or below record low levels for late july
2161257 area lakes are becoming dangerous as the water levels drop unmarked obstructions are now nearer the surface and can cause damage to boats
2161258 additionally unmarked drop offs into deep water are appearing along the shoreline increasing the danger for casual waders and swimmers
2161259 boating in the main lake channels between channel buoys decreases the danger but does not eliminate it all boaters need to wear life jackets at all times when in an open hull boat or when above deck
2161260 over a three month period 18 500 gallons of water can pass through a hole the size of a pencil point likewise a hole measuring 1 16 of an inch in diameter will result in the loss of 74 000 gallons of water over the same period of time thats a lot of water and money
2161261 were doing fine but if the water table continues to drop we will start having problems
2161262 because of a few thundershowers this past month water production decreased somewhat dropping from 17 5 million gallons in june to 15 3 million gallons in july

2161264 lincoln county is the 51st county in georgia to implement this literacy program we received 10 000 from a block grant to start the program but it will cost 20 000 or 51 per child to keep it going here
2161265 we were excited about our passing rates however the reality that math is still the only test in which we must meet an enhanced score to qualify for ayp hit our school and community hard
2161266 only nine students in our economically disadvantaged subgroup did not pass the ghsgt whereas 14 passed but fell below the enhanced score
2161267 essentially 76 7 percent of the students in this subgroup passed the test but only 64 6 percent met or exceeded the enhanced score to make ayp 74 9 percent of the students would have had to score 516 or higher on the test
2161268 in all 81 6 percent of our black students passed the test but only 56 5 percent attained the enhanced passing score for ayp
2161269 counting the summer re test of these students for ayp purposes would not be useful for high schools why would a student who passed a test take a re test
2161270 also the language arts ghsgt has been revised so that the passing score is the same for the test and ayp in all fairness to our students this should be done for the math ghsgt as well
2161271 our students have demonstrated their competency in math our test scores reflect this a flaw in the system i e using the enhanced math score for ayp purposes should not prevent our school from making ayp
2161272 this year 63 high schools did not make ayp solely because of mathematics
2161273 the figure does not include those that did not make it because of scoring in both math and reading english language arts
2161274 we need to monitor academic performance as well as the withdrawal rate
2161275 if a student withdraws from lchs attends another school and does not graduate it doesnt count against us for ayp but if he doesnt enroll somewhere else it counts against us
2161276 our graduation rate was down this year because a large number of the freshmen class of 2004 withdrew and never re enrolled
2161277 by tracking students more closely we can encourage them to re enroll in school or give them alternatives to staying in school
2161278 after school gets started we hope to have parent walk throughs to give those parents who work the opportunity to meet their childs teachers the guidance counselor and our graduation coach
2161279 we would also like to increase the number of parents and other members of the community who are willing to mentor a child
2161280 this test will help us identify students who could possibly fail to make the enhanced score on the ghsgt
2161281 we can then assign these students to tutoring during lunch or before or after school

2161295 in the beginning which occurred near the start there was nothing but god darkness and some gas the bible says the lord thy god is one but i think he must be a lot older than that anyway god said give me a light and someone did the god made the world he split the adam and made eve adam and eve were naked but they werent embarrassed because mirrors hadnt been invented yet adam and eve disobeyed god by eating one bad apple so they were driven from the garden of eden not sure what they were driven in though because they didnt have cars adam and eve had a son cain who hated his brother as long as he was abel pretty soon all of the early people died off except for methuselah who lived to be like a million or something one of the next important people was noah who was a good guy who was kind of a ham noah built a large boat and put his family and some animals on it he asked some other people to join him but they said they would have to take a rain check after noah came abraham isaac and jacob jacob was more famous than his brother esau because esau sold jacob his birthmark in exchange for some pot roast jacob had a son named joseph who wore a really loud sportscoat another important bible guy is moses whose real name is charlton heston moses led the israel lights out of egypt and away from the evil pharaoh after god sent ten plagues on pharaohs people these plagues included frogs mice lice bowels and no cable god fed the israel lights every day with manicotti then he gave them his ten top commandments smoke dance or covet your neighbors bottom the bible uses a bad word for bottom that im not supposed to say oh yeah i just thought of one more humor thy father and thy mother one of moses best helpers was joshua who was the first bible guy to use spies joshua fought the battle of geritol and the fence fell over the town after joshua came david he got to be king by killing a giant with a slingshot he had a son named solomon who had about 300 wives and 500 porcupines my teacher said he was wise but that doesnt sound very wise to me after solomon there were a bunch of major league prophets one of these was jonah who was swallowed by a big whale and then barfed up on the shore there were also some minor league prophets but i guess we dont have to worry about them after the old testament came the new testament jesus is the star of the new testament he was born in bethlehem in a barn i wish i had been born in a barn too because my mom is always saying to me close the door were you born in a barn it would be nice to say as a matter of fact i was during his life jesus had many arguments with sinners like the pharisees and the republicans jesus also had twelve opossums the worst one was judas asparagus judas was so evil they named a terrible vegetable after him jesus was a great man he healed many leopards and even preached to some germans on the mount but the republicans and all those guys put jesus on trial before pontius the pilot pilot didnt stick up for jesus he just washed his hands instead anyway jesus died for our sins then came back to life again he went up to heaven but will be back at the end of the aluminum his return is foretold in the book of revolution and thats the end of the story

2161300 die rolle des dolmetschers und anwalts scheint bis zu einem gewissen grad unausweichlich weil ethnographie in der tat nicht nur beobachtung sondern immer auch beschreibung des anderen im w rtlichen sinne meint dessen textliche und bildliche darstellung vermittlung und verbreitung im sinne einer stellvertretenden repr sentation in der man ihn in seinem vorgegebenen interpretationsrahmen bestenfalls sprechen l sst dem verstehensversuch muss offenbar ein versuch des begreifens vorausgehen der den betrachtungsgegenstand objektiviert erst dann kann dessen subjektivit t in beziehung zur eigenen gesetzt in differenzierte bilder aufgel st und in verstehende begriffen erkl rt werden das klingt ein wenig nach der ungekl rten geschichte von der henne und dem ei doch ist es hier eindeutig die henne wissenschaft die vor dem ei forschungsgegenstand gackert

2161316 we have in mind members from the cruise companies travel agents who are active in the cruise business hong kong tourism board hktb shipping agents etc
2161317 we have sounded out the idea of acci to the relevant parties in the travel industry and the cruise market who are supportive of the idea apart from developing hardware we consider it equally important to gauge market views on enriching our software to enhance hong kongs position as a regional cruise hub
2161318 the commissioner approached me earlier but there are no concrete details until our first meeting in december
2161319 the main thrust was to promote cruising but as a marketing consortium we voiced our opinions on the existing cruise terminal and reflected the need for a new one activities were more commercial oriented like classroom type training on how to sell cruises and how to conduct cruise inspections
2161320 unlike the previous council i see this revived one focusing more on the new cruise terminal like consulting on design proposed by bidders and inbound matters such as staff training how to handle passenger movement crowd management and baggage flow

2161421 the advent of low cost carriers lcc has been a boon to popularise online travel bookings the lccs prefer e tickets to save on basic costs hence the rapid growth in online bookings
2161422 we are in talks with four to five luxury hotel brands and deals are expected to be finalised in three months time

2161431 theyre essentially trying to establish a penal colony in the south bronx
2161432 this is a citywide plan to overall reduce the size of the citys jail system and reduce the dependence on rikers island and its aging facilities
2161433 keeping all the citys inmates on rikers island is downright dangerous
2161434 it stigmatizes and demonizes inmates it is new yorks version of devils island
2161435 ive heard every possible excuse to do something bad in the bronx
2161436 the whole situation is people forgetting how far the south bronx has come

2161441 we are looking at revenue sharing arrangements with online players as well as commission based models with travel services companies in the indian market we would be willing to share technology and content but there will be no equity participation with them
2161442 today almost 62 per cent of the business we do comes from asia india is the seventh country to get added in travelocitys asia list
2161443 the domestic online travel industry is roughly about 800 million around rs 3 600 crore this would include suppliers such as carriers hotels and otas and irctc but these international players still need to build on their brand
2161444 its fine for them to come to india but this market is very complicated and it takes time to build trust among the stakeholders like the airline hotels and others
2161445 it shows that the consumer base is growing but the advent of these global bigwigs is also challenging as they come with a ready made experience and customer base
2161446 hotels is the fastest growing segment for online travel portals as the market is fragmented by offering attractive price and variety the websites are trying to capture the market
2161447 we are looking at increasing our hotel inventory as the demand is increasing we also have a rating plan for hotels in the pipeline
2161448 the share of travel portals is almost doubling each year we have pre purchase deals with these websites which enables customers to get hotel rooms at a competitive price
2161449 mid market and budget hotels are a natural fit for travel portals just like low cost carriers
2161450 future of the travel portals will be driven by hotels and infrastructure

2161472 yes mistakes were made and we were wrong about every single thing we said about this war but the status quo is the way to go us being wrong and almost certainly lying about conditions in iraq to get into a war doesnt matter dont worry about the past something good will come out of this latest war leave it to us things are fine
2161473 hey lets not dwell on the past support the troops
2161474 never mind that we didnt own up to this insignificant bit of

2161507 i would advise any incoming freshman to come in with an open mind and truly try to step out of their comfort zones the uw culture and college environment is so extremely diverse that i think its important for each incoming student to be willing to experience as much of that diversity as possible by joining new clubs attending seminars going to sports games going to frat party or participating in any other activity that you have a passion for or have always desired to try you will not only learn more about what the uw has to offer but you will learn an incredible amount about who you are as a person and where your spot in the uw community resides
2161508 i would tell them the same thing everyone told me when i came in be open to everything and explore everything uw has so much to offer and it can be really intimidating but theres definitely something for everyone so dont restrict or confine yourself
2161509 uw is a big school with a lot of people and resources but as you go it seems more and more like a small community or at least you get more of a small community feeling
2161510 the campus is extremely friendly and welcoming so dont hesitate in approaching people making friends is easy at uw but what is even more amazing is the diverse group of people you can meet with the least bit of effort i would strongly recommend signing up for efs early fall start

2161520 a plot to overthrow the liberian government by force of arms
2161521 as far as im concerned i see mrs sirleafs government from a civil point of view she is the president she has been elected and i honor that particular responsibility to support it and not from the point of view or through the barrel of a gun so if mr koukou thought that way then he is mistaken
2161522 first of all koukou when i read that part of his communication i thought that there was something not really true because koukou knows that i left gbarnga in 1994 after breaking up with charles taylor over the continuation of the war so where did koukou get the idea that there were weapons buried in gbarnga that i should know about at one point i started to think that may be this is a government set up may be this man is trying to extract information from for somebody trying to frame me in the government
2161523 the truth is there are a lot of information coming out of liberia that the government is not doing well corruption and all those things but we need time mrs sirleaf is not working out of a bank of her own and im not supporting her she may have made the indication to the liberian people that once she got elected gold was going to float in the streets of monrovia pipe born water was going to come light was going to come none of this has come that is a failure that we can deal with within the political realm we dont have to go to war we dont have to kill each other and what liberians must understand is that 250 000 liberians lost their lives trying to get rid of the last dictator
2161524 i am not a hero im not looking for any favors from the ellen sirleaf government i have not even heard from the government since this information was sent forward but i feel that i have the responsibility as a senior citizen of this country a former government official i was minister labor president pro temp of the liberian senator it is incumbent upon me to make sure that the peace that we fought for becomes an everlasting phenomena of our nation thats my whole motivation

2161596 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2161597 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity

2161602 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2161603 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2161604 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2161605 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2161606 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2161607 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2161608 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2161609 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2161610 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2161611 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2161612 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2161613 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2161614 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2161615 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2161616 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2161617 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2161618 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2161619 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2161620 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2161621 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2161622 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2161623 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2161624 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2161625 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2161626 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2161627 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2161628 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2161629 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2161630 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2161631 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2161632 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2161633 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2161634 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2161635 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2161636 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2161637 allahs heaven and hell are also in this world when there are no worries it is heaven and when there are worries it is hell it is heaven when we should approach allah for all our works it is hell when we surrender all our works to nafs i ammara
2161638 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2161639 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2161640 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2161641 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2161642 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2161643 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2161644 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2161645 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2161646 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2161647 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2161648 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2161649 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2161650 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2161651 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2161652 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you

2161656 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2161657 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2161658 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2161659 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2161660 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2161661 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2161662 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2161663 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2161664 oh allah you used to keep me hungry and naked like your friends but i do not know the reason that how i have got such a great position similar to your friends
2161665 i will advice you to become the king of this world and other world after death so you should become ascetic in the world and do not
2161666 it is difficult to control the tongue than to look upon the world and dinars and never say any bad thing to others
2161667 he want to explain about ascetic condition but could not explain the same because in which it will be
2161668 do you know that who are you and i have bought your mother in 200 dirhams
2161669 allah will give respect to that person who will not look other than allah but no body has authority on allah true person will not be called true unless he has no balance in between fear and hope
2161670 which action will deliverance for this money we should see that it is coming and it should be spent for the halal purpose only
2161671 one who will desire of heaven and fear of hell and want the
2161672 avoid the world because i have heard that the worshipper who likes the world and for this reason on the day of judgment the angels will announce that this person is one who liked the thing which allah does not like it he further continued that there is nothing in the world which will not finish because in the world no such thing made by allah which will not met its end in this world even some useless things attract the man so he neglects the big things all things depend upon two things first not made for us so for the first thing whatever we will try to avoid it to get but it will reach us for the other thing for which whatever we will try for it to get but it will not reach by us
2161673 oh person you are product of this time so you prefer saying than actions and this is the time for the proud of knowledge and there is no importance of leaving action so you are bad people in the best time
2161674 my condition is to gain the favor of allah and to keep away from the mankind so one who gain favor of allah will be not see the mankind
2161675 first i will to try to convince my mind for the credit then i will take it
2161676 due to his thinking his are visible on his body

2161679 he is ashamed to go to toilet daily due to the presence of
2161680 do you know any person who ignore others due to his frenzied condition
2161681 yes and ask them to wait for some time as he will come soon there
2161682 i have desire for pity on me on the day of judgement which is good for always world is for the some days so if i face the difficulties of this world is better than the difficulties of the day of judgement
2161683 oh allah if you punish me or forgive me and in the both conditions you are my friend
2161684 oh otaiba i love you so i have desire that you will not do any such thing which will cause separation of us
2161685 he divorced the world and at the time of meeting with you i told him that many persons
2161686 his name is ghulam jabbar slave of jabbar so he is walking proudly and at the same time he became un conscious and fallen on the ground when they approached him to see
2161687 once in his student life he saw a beautiful boy with long
2161688 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2161689 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2161690 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his sunnah the prophets teachings and also you will take precautionary measures and will differentiate between the false and true of sayings of the prophet
2161691 oh abu hanifa you were given life to show my sunnah so leave your loneliness
2161692 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2161693 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2161694 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2161695 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2161696 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2161697 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2161698 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2161699 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2161700 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2161701 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2161702 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2161703 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2161704 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2161705 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2161706 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2161707 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2161708 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2161709 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2161710 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind either you will become an unbeliever or will be away from the religion because if he would say if allah wills your knowledge will guide them and it will be equal to the knowledge that is known when that man would say no then you will become an unbeliever and if he says yes then you will be away from the religion
2161711 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2161712 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2161713 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2161714 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2161715 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2161716 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2161717 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2161718 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2161719 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him he also described that he does not know any other person who did such a great favour to the islamic religion
2161720 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2161721 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2161722 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2161723 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2161724 have you got any chance for doing any sin even though you had power of doing it but due to the fear of allah you escaped from it
2161725 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2161726 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2161727 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2161728 it was good that the person was in baghdad if that person would have been in rome then all the romans would have accepted the religion of islam
2161729 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2161730 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2161731 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2161732 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2161733 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2161734 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects try to be a great worshipper of allah they will not get any benefit from their wealth whereas you will be benefited more because of allahs blessings their wealth will remain here in the world they will not carry this to their grave on the contrary the reward of worship to allah will help you to remain pious we all will die one day let us worship allah to have a pious soul
2161735 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2161736 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2161737 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2161738 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he
2161739 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2161740 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2161741 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2161742 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2161743 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2161744 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2161745 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same so you should be grateful for meeting such a great friend of mine but after this you will not see him again
2161746 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2161747 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2161748 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2161749 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2161750 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2161751 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2161752 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from haram illegal things and for the pious persons asceticism is to desire for more and more halal legal things to keep themselves away from all the things which keeps away a man from allah this is asceticism of mystic persons
2161753 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2161754 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2161755 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2161756 oh allah do not take back faith from the believers
2161757 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2161758 oh allah every thing is in your control and you are having command of all the things with you so allow me these things and do not ask what i need
2161759 oh you are so old but you do not know the condition of worship in the both these places there is nothing which will stop the worship of allah
2161760 he rewarded for raising one of his hand and if he raised the another one then we will have given the reward for that hand also
2161761 since 500 years she was adorn for you but you are in condition of negligence
2161762 one night due to fear of allah you were weeping and due to the in your eyes these tears have put on my face as powder and for this reason from that day there is brightness and shining on my forehead
2161763 if the well of zam zam will dry then which water he will drink
2161764 allah will reward you for giving me advice since many years
2161765 he thinks that the foundation of worship is on the fear because hopefulness will keep away us from the worship the foundation of religion and world is on the fear so when there is control of hopefulness on the fear then hearts will not work properly if there will be increase of the fear then the worship will also increases
2161766 fear allah in such extent that there will be no disappointment from the grace of allah and
2161767 the man whose heart is bright will not like worldly desires because that light will separate him from this world and take him towards allah
2161768 one who will return back from the goal will not be successful one who gets some sincerity in the life then he will feel happiness the sincere people will be kept away from doubts the true people when they want to explain the condition of their hearts but their tongues will not help them there are some persons who are in agreeable condition of allah but feel endurance as repentance for themselves because in that condition the man will claim for the repentance but the agreeable condition relates the willingness of allah so the repentance relates with the man and agreeable condition relates with allah
2161769 i like too much agreeable condition so if allah sends every body to hell then all will go there with helplessly but i will accept it with happiness
2161770 if a man busy himself in the worship then angels will plant trees for his each and every worship when the man ceases his worship then they also finish their work there one who leaves all his human desires truly then he will deserve for the reward from the allah
2161771 oh allah such person is not good for your service unless who will not act on your commandments
2161772 oh haroun honor of mysticism is great honor he used to say
2161773 the man should think himself low and he also told the example of persons who have passed away from the world are like medicine from which the persons the example of present persons are like pain who are making healthy persons un healthy
2161774 it is very strange that allahs beloved person is taking help from his enemy so tell him to put the hand on place of pain
2161775 oh allah at the time of doing sin i used to love your beloved friends so for this reason help me and forgive me
2161776 allah blessed him but he could not get the position of persons who
2161777 oh allah i have fulfilled my duty so you do whatever you like
2161778 oh abdullah you are very handsome so dont waste your youth and handsomeness in the disobedience of allah after that he reached the house
2161779 oh allah as i am very bad so your beloved friend is my enemy as he is your beloved friend to whom i love him so for his sake forgive me
2161780 due to expectoration of aslam tosi who made this after ablution and due to fear of that sound i fell down from sky to the ground
2161781 oh sorrow today muhammed aslam left this world and this world could not deceive him and he took with him excellence and qualities
2161782 an old man is standing before me and prohibiting me in this matter and he is fath al mouseli
2161783 for the sake of charity it is good for the rich persons for the humility of poor persons but it more better that the poor persons should hate the rich persons
2161784 i am a traveler so i have right over the local residents i have come over there that on such a place i will die by tomorrow so please arrange for my convalescence bath and bury me in these old clothes
2161785 oh fathe al mousali if i got the nearness of allah then i will give you reward for your service for me
2161786 to live in the world in such a way that life should become eternal
2161787 when he heard this then he took one dirham so that there will be no ungratefulness
2161788 as the patient dies if we stop him giving food and water so in the same way without knowledge wisdom and the advice of saints the hearts of mankind will die
2161789 allah blessed him with his mercy and told him as you were afraid of sins and for this reason you used to weep so much so we have ordered the angles not to write any of your sins
2161790 after obtaining the goal there is no need of logic and guides
2161791 if a person not regretted by heart and if it is oral then it is useless if there is no efforts in the worship and in the mystic exercise then there is no escape from the sins
2161792 if other hurries will know this matter that he is not interested in them then they will make fun of them
2161793 he will not see all of you now but on the day of judgement we can meet him there
2161794 he acquired knowledge from many pious personalities and met 300 pious persons but i think that there are only four of them are great pious persons and among them are abu torab is on the top of them
2161795 some time he eats at basra or at baghdad and some time when he will see any defects in his friends then he used to pray for their repentance
2161796 due to his unluckiness such defects were find in them
2161797 he will not steal the goods as he is a great pious person
2161798 i have no objection for this trouble because my sole was undergone severe punishment of shame today then the old man took me to his house and presented egg and bread when i was reluctant to eat the above food then i heard a divine call in which it
2161799 as you got the punishment for your desire so now you can eat this but the desire of your sole will be fulfilled after it will be punished
2161800 one who will not believe this then he will become disbeliever
2161801 one who has faith in allah will not require any thing with him
2161802 for a period of thirty years he did not borrowed any thing from others or not given any thing to any body
2161803 i do not have any desire with allah so i am happy for his approval in any condition what ever he likes
2161804 the eceased was the owner of the lamp in his life but now after his death his heirs are owners so it is not good to lit the lamp without their permission
2161805 his preaching will not be good for the mankind because he is a lover of the world and the preacher must have effect to guide the mankind then he should preach he should have sequence in his preaching and in his condition there should be divine help for him
2161806 why were so effective the styles of preachers who were passed away from the world
2161807 because they want to propagate the islam and want to control the sole in their preaching
2161808 the love of allah is better than the mankind do not disclose the secret matters always sit in the company of pious persons keep away from the company of ignorant persons and sit in the company of learned persons
2161809 asking for more will cause difficulties to think sole as better will create proud
2161810 one should think himself lower so that world may respect you
2161811 he is afraid of their condition of darweshi mysticism and so he is much concerned about this as they follow it properly or not than their wealthy condition
2161812 inspite of your bad characters i have blessed you and your slave and the persons who were present in that time
2161813 oh allah i have committed sins not due to disobedience but due to fraud of the satan and sole so forgive me due to your grace and kindness
2161814 who is great learned person in the mankind and who is a great ignorant man
2161815 the great learned person is one who is obedient and having fear of allah the greatest ignorant man is one who is a poor and sinner
2161816 fondness is required for the absent one but allah is present for every moment
2161817 your wealth and children are problems for you but we ourselves are more problems makers
2161818 to live in the world without greed and lust and to live with broken heart is
2161819 to acquire any thing which is not good for the next world is useless
2161820 the best desire is that which will solve our problems
2161821 if you want to become more important than others so for this thing leave every thing you can see all others standing in need of you
2161822 we have created jinn and human beings for my worship
2161823 to sacrifice the and if you can not do this then leave to act upon the sayings of the mystic persons
2161824 he was regret to know that you had sold away your religion for the value of two particles of gold because at the time purchasing some thing from some body you told him the price five times less to the salesman which the owner of the shop told you and due to your status of dignity the salesman believed your statement and sold away the thing at the lesser price
2161825 to learn quran for worldly gains is not useful and it is
2161826 you are a slave so for the slave there will be no comfort
2161827 you got your punishment of your thought and if you thought more than this then you will get more punishment than this
2161828 as you looked other than us so we had taken back your dress of pious persons if then we will also take back your
2161829 here i find the recitation of quran and the worship style which is not as per my standard
2161830 i know well that you did not stolen my donkey but i
2161831 i do not blame you for this act and this is
2161832 he said this and left that place when his son was reading the holy quran and when he reached on the following verse
2161833 then the boy due to the fear of allah died suddenly
2161834 the shortage of wealth is useful in the both worlds and its increase is harmful in the both worlds
2161835 the best indigent person is one from whom the kings could not ask the revenue and on the day of judgment allah will not ask for his accountability
2161836 abu ali you always think for yourself and you did not think for others
2161837 we had sent the tiger for you so by holding the tigers legs you should come out of the well

2161841 one of our beloved person has asked you to bring some sweet but you ignore his request
2161842 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy

2161935 people who work in area x tend to believe that area x is inherently worthwhile referees who work in area x will usually evaluate papers in area x by the standards of area x they will seldom if ever say that work in area x is pointless and should be discontinued this is why an editor who wants to debunk a paper on alchemy sends the paper to a chemist not an alchemist someone has to say the emperor has no clothes

2161939 there is no race to the moon it so happens that we are all working in the same time frame
2161940 it was annoying and difficult to be trying to fight a tough golf course and have eye aggravating me at the same time
2161941 theres only one guy whos going to like this place by the end of the week
2161942 the course is 7 500 yards long the greens are firm and the pins are tucked away
2161943 they are sucking the fun out of the major championships when you set it up like that
2161944 i sound as if im moaning which i am but its a great shame
2161945 its a fantastic golf course they are great greens and they are playable but there is no need to play it as it is
2161946 try to remember that i actually can play golf even though it didnt look like that on the first hole
2161947 my caddie said remember we played with tiger in the u s open and i think he took 6 on the first hole pretty much every day so you can shoot a good round from here as well
2161948 this is one of the clubs that prides itself on how hard it is i dont think anyone expected it to be easy it wouldnt be a monster if it was
2161949 if you had rees jones redo scrabble hed leave out the vowels
2161950 should we be patient and wait until we move up in the google search results or do we continue to spend on the google adwords program knowing that it doesnt bring quality visits product sales or even long term customer relationships
2161951 she struck a culvert went airborne and then flipped once
2161952 she didnt hit that fence with her car but the piece of concrete culvert that she hit flew up and rammed the fence
2161953 i think they just want to run a few more tests and make sure everything is all right
2161954 there was a lot of blood in that car thats for sure
2161955 her husband came up here and drove right by it at first because the car was so mangled up that he didnt recognize it when he got home he realized that her car wasnt there and that she should have been home before him
2161956 and then he came back and realized that the car that was so messed up was his wifes
2161957 we think she was bringing dinner home to her family and just didnt quite make it there
2161958 weve got a survey team that will be up there to look at it
2161959 it may have been straight line winds it may have been a tornado weve heard conflicting reports
2161960 we were watching and boom the whole house just felt like somebody rocked it
2161961 i walked out in the street and saw the rain coming no tornado or anything like that
2161962 i could see the rain coming down the street then we had the winds for about 10 to 15 minutes i closed up the shop and went to work
2161963 at least theres no more damage done and nobody hurt here
2161964 its my last season and i want to do something special i want to get that first conference win
2161965 you strive to reach a better goal every year im not setting the bar at just one conference win i want more than one
2161966 everyone was going crazy patting me on the back carrying me
2161967 everyone seems a little more relaxed instead of tense were serious though we dont really want to lose this year
2161968 hes never really played soccer but you couldnt really tell if you saw him in goal
2161969 hes notched a lot of goals from the get go last year
2161970 i think he took a lot of conference teams by surprise because he has the ability to play from his feet hes not just a natural speedster he can beat you with his feet and he can beat you on the run
2161971 weve got to look toward the end of the season and now worry too much about getting beat early in the season
2161972 right now the way it looks being so young and losing our no 1 runner i think we are going to struggle getting into the top half of the conference
2161973 but i think that is what we are going to set our goal as
2161974 i think if she can set a personal goal to be in the top 10 in the conference it would be a good goal for her i think shes capable of it
2161975 she seems to be in as good of running shape as anybody on the team right now she is just a fluent natural looking runner she just loves to run
2161976 the girls team is going to be on the young side
2161977 we lost two seniors last year that were in the scoring all the time
2161978 everybody is going to have to move up and we have got some boys that are running pretty close i dont think we are going to have on outstanding runner like chris was for us last year
2161979 i am hoping alex is going to be somewhere near the top 10
2161980 he is going to have to work at it he works hard and stays in pretty good shape
2161981 we are hoping to finish in the top half of the conference
2161982 i dont want to set the goals too high because we have got a very young team and i dont have any strong senior leadership it is going to be a matter of developing a lot of new runners
2161983 communities of practice are groups of people who share a concern or a passion for something they do and learn how to do it better as they interact regularly
2161984 i had to rationalize that gabriel did something bad that he asked for it butler said talking about the incident more than two years later
2161985 i mean why would the cops do this there had to be something i didnt know but i found out later there was nothing gabriel had done nothing wrong
2161986 continually tried to pull chapman away according to one police report
2161987 due to the nature of the assistance call by deputies i felt for officer safety reasons i needed to gain control of celli immediately perez wrote
2161988 i tackled celli and the female subject to the ground immediately releasing the female subject from my grasp
2161989 celli repeatedly kept trying to roll over onto his back and get up perez continued
2161990 i began giving celli distraction blows with my hands and knees to keep him from sitting up
2161991 he kept saying ok ok butler said in an interview
2161992 they turned my life upside down these guys need to be taken off the force
2161993 our standard to file charges is to prove the crime beyond a reasonable doubt she said
2161994 a not guilty doesnt mean we shouldnt have filed charges a jury saw it differently
2161995 as a staff i think we have the same expectations this year that weve had every year
2161996 theyre probably a little more attainable this year when you look at our football team
2161997 when we first came in here and started writing goals on the board we talked about winning a conference championship and having the opportunity to play in the liberty bowl as well as winning a bowl game after year two people asked if i thought we could get to a bowl game so quickly i said then that was in the hands of the players and how far they would progress in two years
2161998 we didnt have pads on but it is a good way to measure
2161999 we looked good out there running around we looked fast reacted quicker and we looked like we are playing smarter one of the main things is that the dbs didnt let anybody behind them
2162000 i think the kids are real interested in getting better ive got kids whose parents have told me theyre picking up a racket for the first time
2162001 like a lot of sports if youve been in athletics and youve been exposed to it
2162002 i think a lot of it at this level is common sense if i had a lot of kids that were going to be playing in college i definitely would be behind the curve in coaching them because they would want somebody that knew a lot
2162003 as far as playing ability im not sure where everybodys going to be
2162004 a lot of the girls especially the ones just picking up a racket i just hope i can keep them interested
2162005 im hopeful well say at the end of the season that theyve gotten better because it is a young team if everybody is open minded about trying to learn and get better then maybe after theyve had a year or two it wont be that way
2162006 one of our goals is to eliminate boating accidents and things like that a good inspection simply makes your chances of having a problem a lot less
2162007 if the boats pass our inspections and this is a coast guard inspection we issue them a decal to put on their boat to show their boat has met coast guard safety specifications
2162008 both the neuse and the pamlico rivers have nutrient rich waters
2162009 they dont want to lose tourism in the area so they dont want everyone talking about algae and dead fish they want to put a band aid over it hold their breath and hope things dont get worse
2162010 they want to pretend this is natural but its not we humans are very much the problem
2162011 teachers arent compensated enough as it is as well as teacher assistants
2162012 it certainly does not help morale when teachers work so hard to meet a performance standard and theyre not compensated
2162013 it sounds like its not going to happen this year and it is disheartening to know that their stated abc bonuses arent going to come through
2162014 all along until the final hour we were thinking they would never cut abc bonuses
2162015 theyve never done it before that i know of the teachers obviously love what theyre doing but its nice to see that abc performance check in the mail in august or september whenever we can get them out
2162016 weve been grieving on and off for nearly four years but we always knew this would be the outcome
2162017 now we have to focus on finding justice for her
2162018 i just cant believe its been almost four years it will be four years exactly next week
2162019 thats all you can ask for i mean everybody wants the truth
2162020 i find it impossible to imagine that she wandered off into a trashed creek bed on her own covered herself up with leaves and died
2162021 she would never abandon her kids or her job we all know that the whole thing just sounds hinky
2162022 well work with the airline to determine the cause of the smoke

2162065 we have an opportunity to inform them about the first amendment they seem to have placed that very low on their priority list if they are aware at all
2162066 but all of a sudden we started hearing about cases where administrators were disciplining or retaliating against journalism advisers
2162067 the senator said if thats happening then the speech is not truly protected and the law is moot because administrators are finding other ways to control the speech

2162097 if god created everything then god created evil since evil exists and according to the principal that our works define who we are then god is evil
2162098 what kind of question is this of course it exists have you never been cold
2162099 in fact sir cold does not exist according to the laws of physics what we consider cold is in reality the absence of heat everybody or object is susceptible to study when it has or transmits energy and heat is what makes a body or matter have or transmit energy absolute zero 460 degrees f is the total absence of heat all matter becomes inert and incapable of reaction at that temperature cold does not exist we have created this word to describe how we feel if we have no heat
2162100 once again you are wrong sir darkness does not exist either darkness is in reality the absence of light light we can study but not darkness in fact we can use newtons prism to break white light into many colors and study the various wavelengths of each color you cannot measure darkness a simple ray of light can break into a world of darkness and illuminate it how can you know how dark a certain space is you measure the amount of light present isnt this correct darkness is a term used by man to describe what happens when there is no light present
2162101 of course as i have already said we see it every day it is in the daily example of mans inhumanity to man it is in the multitude of crime and violence everywhere in the world these manifestations are nothing else but evil
2162102 evil does not exist sir or at least it does not exist unto itself evil is simply the absence of god it is just like darkness and cold a word that man has created to describe the absence of god god did not create evil evil is not like faith or love that exist just as does light and heat evil is the result of what happens when man does not have gods love present in his heart its like the cold that comes when there is no heat or the darkness that comes when there is no light

2162174 summer rallies are generally fleeting and we do not believe that fundamentals have changed sufficiently for the bear market to have ended
2162175 however the averages hide the fact that 40 per cent of previous bears were in the 20 per cent to 22 per cent range and half were shorter a severe bear market would typically last for 2 years with 50 per cent losses such as in 2000 02

2162185 16 years of accumulated rage suppressed by nothing more than brief glimpses of hope which have all but faded to black
2162186 please forgive me if i act a little strange for i know not what i do feels like lightening running through my veins every time i look at you help me out here all my words are falling short and theres so much i want to say want to tell you just how good it feels when you look at me that way ive got half a mind to scream out loud ive got half a mind to die so i wont ever have to lose you girl i wont ever have to say goodbye i wont ever have to lie
2162187 i dont get many things right the first time in fact i am told that a lot now i know all the wrong turns the stumbles and falls brought me here and where was before the day that i first saw your lovely face now i see it every day and i know that i am i am i am the luckiest i love you more than i have ever found a way to say to you

2162193 the entire thing is a tragedy for all families involved
2162194 officer pulliam was a valued member of this organization im sure the suspects family is suffering also
2162195 a big part of it is done to keep dads memory alive and the memory of the children weve met over the years
2162196 but im really proud of her this was something willie really believed in
2162197 teachers arent compensated enough as it is as well as teacher assistants
2162198 it certainly does not help morale when teachers work so hard to meet a performance standard and theyre not compensated
2162199 it sounds like its not going to happen this year and it is disheartening to know that their stated abc bonuses arent going to come through
2162200 all along until the final hour we were thinking they would never cut abc bonuses
2162201 theyve never done it before that i know of the teachers obviously love what theyre doing but its nice to see that abc performance check in the mail in august or september whenever we can get them out
2162202 i would like to touch the ball more any running back would
2162203 weve got three backs that havent seen the ball that much
2162204 last year we had success running the ball we want to see if we can get the running game going again
2162205 i think if we pound the rock and make them work theyll go ahead and tire out
2162206 my main focus is to let the defense know the run game is still here
2162207 with more running your passing game just becomes that more explosive
2162208 there was still a little animosity out there but like our coach said we just need to forget about it
2162209 everybody is focused we still have a legitimate shot of making the playoffs
2162210 were working on it as hard as we can to bring it together
2162211 i think everybody is still confident once the confidence takes over everything will go smoothly
2162212 its an opportunity to get something in our temporary gallery that has a little more substance to it
2162213 some people will walk in and they probably wont know that thats blackbeards flag
2162214 or that blackbeard was only a pirate for two years
2162215 were hoping to educate people and show this was not a glamorous life
2162216 we offer something a little different were a band that has a show
2162217 the director wanted keanu reeves because he could play a robotic character
2162218 all the music that had inspired me when i was young stravinsky prokofiev was ballet
2162219 so my agent approached abt and i went to a performance where i saw twylas in the upper room i said id like to work with her and they said oh that might be difficult then three days later they phoned to say she wanted to meet me we hung out for an afternoon and said lets do it we got to know each other talking about narrative versus non narrative the pros and cons of each
2162220 so i hadnt seen his work there he has a ton of energy he has a lot of range hes very versatile and he had his own rock n roll band who could not love that also he knows his film history and he knows his 20 th century classical music history the russians in particular
2162221 it was rite of spring that turned my world upside down when i was 17 prokofievs
2162222 i figured ill start and then go play music with twyla and see what she responds to
2162223 the first time we hung out listening to a lot of records she happened to be listening to a scott joplin opera i thought ive never written a rag im going to write her a rag and i knew i was going to use a lot of percussion i wanted to end up with five movements i set myself certain parameters that every movement would borrow from each other i tried to create something where if i had the movements laid out if they were made of glass and i dropped them i would take fragments of each of them and mix them up so that each was borrowing bits from the other
2162224 also hes used to action to seeing and then reinforcing so he was ideal from the point of view of supporting action he was very focused a delight to work with he would always take the extra step sending you three versions instead of just two
2162225 i thought she would pick two or three but she liked them all
2162226 so then the challenge was to put them together there is some gamelan music a rag that revolves around electronic sounds lots of drums all integrated into a very dense framework because i was writing for twyla i wanted to keep a sense of rhythm and propulsion and a strong melodic core i expect to get murdered critically for all of that but i hope that a sense of fun is there
2162227 sense of geometry and symmetry and shaping dynamics in a way thats not what one would think in the broader sense it was so full of surprises it was very surreal it was nothing like what i imagined in my minds eye yet i didnt know what to imagine i never had a doubt or question about what she was going to do i just knew that whatever she did it was going to be wonderful at least from my perspective and she didnt let me down ever i saw six out of seven performances in new york and at the last one i was still seeing stuff for the first time
2162228 i knew that i was going to have an ensemble demi soloists and principals
2162229 the title comes from sam and mary a solo study of rhythmic evolutions i did some while ago to brahms songs
2162230 as i worked i realized that there is a constant struggle going on inside us all between left and right or sam and mary as i called them then equilibrium has never been my forte and therefore seeking repose for this ever shifting internal mechanism of left and right has always seemed an enviable goal i am in awe of that moment when the two sides left and right sam and mary fast fleeing rabbit and pursuing rogue give up the chase and work in tandem to create the effortless suspension in space that is classical perch
2162231 before i ever made work here i had ideas about ballet tradition at the ballet classes i took when i first came to new york i would see great dancers like cynthia gregory and lupe serrano i would look at them and study what they could do and what i couldnt do and then id think maybe they should try what i could do
2162232 i had a fantasy about movements that were easier than earthly movements its that adventure that prompts new attempts sometimes known as inspiration
2162233 the stars all aligned we spend periods of time away learning lessons and then come back
2162234 i have so many outrageous stories too many and im gonna tell em all
2162235 all the unexpurgated brain jangling tales of debauchery sex and drugs transcendence and chemical dependence you will ever want to hear and this is not just my take this is the unbridled truth the in your face up close and prodigious tale of steven tyler straight from the horses lips
2162236 if you are going to read this dont bother after a couple of pages you wont want to be here so forget it go away get out while you are still in one piece save yourself
2162237 brothers and sisters the spirit comes to the aid of our weakness for we do not know how to pray as we ought but the spirit himself intercedes with inexpressible groanings and the one who searches hearts knows what is the intention of the spirit because he intercedes for the holy ones according to gods will
2162238 my wifes death showed our much maligned public health service operating with compassion efficiency and remarkable care for the wishes of the family headline
2162239 during the more than year long illness of my wife shirley we were exposed to the public health system in an intimate way
2162240 shirley came home more than a year ago after having suffered a severe pneumonia that nearly ended her life
2162241 unsurprisingly shirleys general health continued to deteriorate during the year
2162242 by the end of the year in every function she had become weaker and less mobile
2162243 by now it had become plain to the doctors that shirley did not have long to live
2162244 so all on the public health purse we had a daily visit from a home care worker to take care of her personal needs a daily visit from a nurse to check on her medications which we suggested after ten days or so that she be allowed to abandon since she was anxious not to delay the onset of her death two shift nurses a week for eight hours a day to provide me with some relief from the caregiver strains and promises of more if i needed them and finally for more than a week almost daily visits from a team of palliative care doctors who circulate in the community caring for terminally ill patients in their homes
2162245 her main problem was pulmonary fibrosis or scar tissue on her lung from her initial pneumonia
2162246 the palliative care doctors were remarkably straightforward in explaining to shirley and our family what was happening and what was likely to happen so her death came as no surprise and as rather a relief in the end
2162247 since one of our main concerns following her death was to avoid having any religious apparatchik intoning over her we hired a newish animal a sort of transportation service that had her out of the house and away to the crematorium within two hours of her death and at very much lower rates than are charged by funeral directors we dispensed with a funeral but intend to hold a party to celebrate her life sometime in may when our children are able to gather from their various far flung places of residence at which time we will distribute her ashes back into the natural system that takes care of life death and renewal

2162266 i dont know how much wisdom you have accumulated in your stay on this planet but let me tell you a few things
2162267 gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt gt wisdom is a state of mind and honestly i think i have accumulated enough to stand on my own feet and face the world and collection of wisdom depends on circumstances issues that you get exposed to in your personal and professional life so you may question my wisdom collection accumulation as you have stated but its to no avail has no meaning you could tell me a thing or two through your accumulated wisdom and so could i and this could go on back and forth for as long as need be so point being i guess nothing as comparing our wisdom has nothing to do with this conversation does it now your comments 1 wifes family has a tendency to be over sympathetic towards her it is not unusual for girls to spice up the stories a little bit to gain sympathy the statement borders on the line of being a view of a male chauvinist pig mcp going forward the trait of being over sympathetic is not just restricted to wifes family sympathy gender neutrality makes more sense it has nothing to do with wifes family this comment could be easily turned around and we could replace the word wifes family

2162350 the atmospheres concentration of carbon dioxide co 2 has increased by more than thirty percent over the last two hundred and fifty years largely due to human activity 2 two thirds of that rise has occurred in the past fifty years 2 unless there is a change the world will see much higher carbon dioxide levels in the future levels that are predicted to lead to damaging climate change 2
2162351 the environmental community is currently playing a prominent role in the development of the carbon dioxide policies that will elicit these strategies 2
2162352 such a high concentration is likely to be accompanied by significant global warming rising sea level increased threats to human health more frequent extreme weather events and serious ecological disruption 2

2162388 one question we are mulling is the closeness of the vote and whether there is still a significant danger of the committee raising rates especially as our forecasts show cpi inflation at 5pc in september
2162389 we judge that the mpc will not raise rates just to make a statement over its commitment to the 2pc target given the potential costs to the economy hence a rate increase is likely to be avoided but cuts are likely to have to wait until next year

2162425 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2162426 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2162427 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2162428 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis

2162439 its sort of a celebration of local music on behalf of upcoming artistes in zimbabwe with it we are saying though we may not have much attention but we can still make it
2162440 it might be one of those rare moments when a local upcoming musician has gone outside our countrys borders with a full band while launching an album and performing at the same time
2162441 i decided to launch the album in south africa because it is one of the central and versatile places in africa and that alone gives the country the power to push the album to a broader audience considering that the world cup games would lure different people from across the globe
2162442 that way i am planting a seed that would offer me maximum exposure it would also sort of trigger the albums release in south africa where it was not yet available on the market
2162443 the distribution of the album locally has been quite a struggle since its release late last year
2162444 i think its because he does it in a non glamorous fashion he doesnt blow guys away or shatter bats or get a lot of strikeouts but hes the type of guy who can frustrate an opponent because you look up in the sixth inning and youre being shut out

2162446 when he has his sinker he can go six shutout innings like tonight

2162478 what if one day newtonian mechanics was the absolute truth and the next day it was limited and inexact so culturally at least relativity was pretty darn shocking too
2162479 if i have seen a little further it is by standing on the shoulders of giants
2162480 but as science developed from physics to chemistry and biology we did eventually have
2162481 by the time biologists today come to dealing with human mental phenomena and volitional behaviors they are taking them very seriously on their own levels of organization and not merely reducing them to the levels of the underlying mechanistic processes of physics chemistry and basic biology
2162482 so in the study of evolution and in attempts to deal scientifically with the higher order biological phenomena of consciousness and mental processes the neodarwinians seem to accept and speak of long taboo notions such as
2162483 but what our current big bang universe and the dynamic story of evolution gives us is a universe that contained the inherent potentiality inherent in its elements and laws for life to be able to emerge just as it has done not strict determinism as in newtonian mechanics
2162484 this is contrary to almost everything i believe as a biologist biologists dont want vitalism any more than physicists i am really shocked and disappointed that you believe this the only point that has some merit is that there are some physicists mostly of elementary particle type who think that what they are studying is the most fundamental and everything else is applied science
2162485 it is true that this world that we know is not deterministic
2162486 it is wrong to think that a bigger pay would undermine the moral authority of the government

2162521 dont we have two millenia of teachings that it is by grace and not by works that we enter into any kind of intimacy with the divine goodness yet legalism is always creeping back into our human attempts to understand gods love
2162522 rather i think of it like participating in the sacraments our relationship to god through the church is starved if we deprive ourselves of the sacraments likewise if we refuse to participate in the world in a way that conforms to our end we lose something of the sacramentality of being in the world

2162549 whats more disturbing is there are so many people more concerned about what other people think of us than whether we survive or not
2162550 over the last five years the white house and congress have increased spending on hiv prevention treatment and support programs for low income countries dramatically at the same time that domestic spending has remained all but flat
2162551 i think its better if they think ill of us and were alive instead of thinking well of us and were dead

2162558 the spot is airing in select media markets across the country with huge success in just four weeks the ad has inflated charcocaps sales by 50 in wal mart stores
2162559 a revolution is an insurrection an act of violence by which one class overthrows another a rural revolution is a revolution by which the peasantry overthrows the power of the feudal landlord class without using the greatest force the peasants cannot possibly overthrow the deep rooted authority of the landlords which has lasted for thousands of years
2162560 raise the united voice we need gandhi to end the national crisis
2162561 the communist party exhorts every member to popularize the role of the indian allied armies as defenders in the threatened areas communists must offer organized co operation of the people through their mass organisation and party units to the british or indian troops for offensive as well as defensive preparations
2162562 as to the structure and composition of the party itself lenin considered that it should consist of two parts a a close circle of regular cadres of leading party workers chiefly professional revolutionaries that is party workers free from all occupation except party work and possessing the necessary minimum of theoretical knowledge political experience organizational practice and the art of combating the tsarist police and of eluding them and b a broad network of local party organizations and a large number of party member enjoying the sympathy and support of hundreds of thousands of working people
2162563 1 that no revolutionary movement can endure without a stable organization of leaders that maintains continuity 2 that the wider the masses spontaneously drawn into the struggle the more urgent the need of such an organization and the more solid this organization must be 3 that such an organization must consist chiefly of people professionally engaged in revolutionary activity 4 that in an autocratic state the more we confine the membership of such an organization to people who are pro fessionally engaged in revolutionary activity and who have been professionally trained in the art of combating the political police the more difficult will it be to wipe out such an organization and 5 the greater will be the number of people of the working class and of the other classes of society who will be able to join the movement and perform active work in it
2162564 which it was the communist partys function to develop among them
2162565 in 1946 the communists inspired punnapra vayalar uprising in travancore almost at the same time the peasantry in telangana rallied under the red flag to rise up against feudal exploitation this revolt lasting for five years between 1946 and oct 1951 was the largest guerrilla peasant uprising in modern india this revolt took away at least 4000 peasant lives such peasant uprisings for a better social order will continue to inspire us in building a society devoid of exploitation of man by man
2162566 it is obvious that the c p did not play a decisive role in the freedom struggle otherwise the indian people would not have been facing the miserable conditions they are facing today with poverty and unemployment increasing with the spectacle of a nation at discord victims of every divisive force the leadership of the freedom struggle remained firmly in the hands of the bourgeois leadership of the indian national congress even when mass struggles sometimes went beyond the limits set by the congress when people turned to armed resistance the consciousness of the masses accepting the leadership did not change and therefore the struggle could not spread all over india
2162567 he further adds that kisanji and prachanda in their interviews have added more to the confusion and that what they say are full of contradictions
2162568 should themselves conduct investigation in the rural areas to get to know one or two villages
2162569 the party established a national united front with the bourgeoisie and with the break up of the united front engaged in bitter armed struggle with the big bourgeoisie and its allies
2162570 otherwise it will be impossible to arouse the enthusiasm of the masses we cannot overcome difficulties without democracy of course its even more impossible to do so without centralism but if theres no democracy there wont be any centralism
2162571 fabian imperialism and social imperialism are one and same thing socialism in words but imperialism in deeds opportunism becoming imperialism third international tasks july 14 1919
2162572 we have long back brought out our view on the khitchri concept of social imperialism
2162573 the faults in building up socialism were to a great extent identified
2162574 changes favouring the forces of freedom democracy peace and socialism
2162575 reflected two different approaches to chinas problems and called for the implementation of very different policies
2162576 the call for the consolidation of the new democratic system was in fact a call for building capitalism
2162577 at every step of the way however maos line met opposition and resistance primarily from a more
2162578 a government led by the communist party have attracted world wide attention and constitute the single biggest event in our national political life
2162579 the transformation of the path of independent capitalist to independent non capitalist development
2162580 the present indian state is the organ of the class rule of the bourgeosie and landlords led by the big bourgeoisie who are increasingly collaborating with foreign finance capital
2162581 contradiction and conflict exist between the indian bourgeoisie including the big bourgeoisie and foreign imperialists
2162582 this stratum of the bourgeoisie will be compelled to come into opposition with state power and can find a place in the peoples democratic front ibid art
2162583 the long term antagonism and short term accommodation and dependence
2162584 as explained by the cpm or the earlier khruschivite revisionists this is the traditional meaning of the word comprador whose origin was portuguese meaning purchaser and coming into use to refer to a local merchants acting as a middleman between foreign producers and a local market
2162585 big bourgeoisie are not compradors nor the country is semi colonial
2162586 the industrial base of the indian big bourgeoisie was far stronger than that of the chinese big bourgeoisie
2162587 since the imperialist bourgeoisie is doing everything in its power to implant a reformist movement among the oppressed nation too there has been a certain
2162588 the industrialization of india under the control of british finance capital and with the co operation not on equal terms of the indian bourgeoisie was giving the latter a semblance of power
2162589 the industrial base of the indian big bourgeoisie was far stronger than the chinese big bourgeoisie
2162590 a blasphemous lie to assert that freedom has been achieved our national leadership has accepted sham freedom
2162591 distinction between the colonial and semi colonial countries on the one hand and the independent capitalist imperialist countries on the other
2162592 sixth that it is necessary constantly to explain and expose among the broadest masses of the toilers of all countries and particularly of the backward countries the deception systematically practiced by the imperialist powers in creating under the guise of politically independent states states which are wholly dependent upon them economically financially and militarily
2162593 starting with relegating the aspect of imperialist oppression and enslavement into the background ended with clean bypassing the national liberationist aspect of our struggle and nullifying the distinction between the revolution in independent imperialist countries and revolution in colonial and dependent countries
2162594 a change from the direct rule of imperialism to its indirect rule
2162595 winning a stable parliamentary majority backed by mass revolutionary movement
2162596 made the cpi abandon the past official announcement on the fake independence embodied in the semi colonial semi feudal system
2162597 complete severance from the british empire and full and real independence
2162598 the entire party went into election campaign immediately after the all india party conference held in october 1951
2162599 including industrialists and merchants and other class of common people
2162600 since we are speaking of colonial policy in the epoch of capitalist imperialism it must be observed that finance capital and its foreign policy which is the struggle of the great powers for the economic and political division of the world give rise to a number of l forms of state dependence not only are the two main groups of countries those owning colonies and the colonies themselves but also the diverse forms of dependent countries which politically are formally independent but in fact are enmeshed in the net of financial and diplomatic dependence typical of this epoch we have already referred to one form of dependence the semi colony
2162601 it has been the main and general tendency of the owners of capital the world over to try to cooperate with the international finance capital and to be its partner indian big bourgeoisie has taken recourse to such cooperation standing own their on strong basis it is not business of the comprador bourgeoisie the flow of international finance has surely influenced the indian big bourgeoisie with regard to their economic decision and role while keeping intact their own capital they are used to taking necessary decision to increase profit besides that from the position of their own strength with the help of foreign investment they are entering new field if dependence co operation relation express the compradorial character then we have to say the capitalists of the whole of the third world are compradors to tell the truth then the bourgeoisie of many european countries are to be called comprador bourgeoisie for their keeping close relations with and partial dependence on imperialist capital
2162602 it may help to crate and sustain within third world countries a class which is dependent on the continued existence of aid and foreign private investment and which therefore becomes an ally of imperialism
2162603 if dependence cooperation relation express the compradorial character then we have to say the capitalists of the whole of the third world are compradors
2162604 who cares to listen to anils and his partys sermon concealing neo colonial exploitation and playing second fiddle to imperialist capitals owners and ambassadors
2162605 american capital does not want to come to rule india the aim behind this coming is solely for fulfilling the dream of indias development
2162606 to tell the truth then the bourgeoisie of many european countries are to be called comprador bourgeoisie for their keeping close relation with and partial dependence on imperialist capital
2162607 the usa has brought the other capitalist countries sufficiently under its sway to be able to prevent them going to war among themselves and weakening one another that the foremost capitalist minds have been sufficiently taught by the two world wars and the severe damage they caused to the world capitalist world not to venture to involve the capitalist countries in war with one another again
2162608 would it not be truer to say that capitalist britain and after her capitalist france will be compelled in the end into conflict with it in order to secure an independent position and of course high profit
2162609 hmg his majestys government believe that british commercial and industrial interests in india can look forward to a fair field for their enterprise under the new conditions the commercial connection between india and the united kingdom has been long and friendly and will continue to be their mutual advantage
2162610 i dont believe this british capital in india will ever be expropriated the british firms will carry on
2162611 it is a happy sign that americans have begun taking intimate interest in indo american economic relations
2162612 maintain conditions of full employment by large scale manufacturing and export of capital goods indias post war requirements can therefore be absolutely dovetailed into each other
2162613 call to stay back in india those revisionist liars shall never disclose the fact that the
2162614 if the analysis of the maoists is accepted then it amounts to saying that with the break down of the old colony imperialism took recourse to neo colonial tactics
2162615 under the exploitative drive of neo colonialism the so called developed nations indulged in rapacious economic exploitation in the lesser developed nations of africa asia and latin america
2162616 pre 1947 it was not possible to advance through the chinese path
2162617 all the guiding principle of military operations grow out of the one basic principle to stive to the utmost to preserve ones strength and destroy that of the enemy
2162618 1 the type of base areas 2 guerrilla zones and base areas 3 conditions for establishing base areas 5 forms in which we and the enemy encircle one another
2162619 what then are these base area they base area are the strategic base on which the guerrilla forces rely in performing their strategic tasks and achieveing the object of preserving and expanding themselves and destroying and driving out the enemy without such strategic bases there will be nothing to depend on in carrying out any of our strategic tasks or achieving the aim of the war it is a characteristic of guerrilla warfare behind the enemy lines that it is fought without a rear for the guerrilla forces are severed from the countrys general rear but guerrilla warfare could not last long or grow without base areas the base areas indeed are its rear
2162620 a base area for guerrilla war can be truly established only with the gradual fulfilment of the three basic conditions i e only after the anti japanese armed forces are built up the enemy has suffered defeats and the people are aroused
2162621 many regions will remain guerrilla zones for a long time
2162622 to sit by idly neither moving nor fighting or to move about without fighting would be an intolerable attitude for a guerrilla unit
2162623 mistakes in our leadership or strong enemy pressure may cause a reversal of the state of affairs described above i e a guerrilla base may turn into an area under relatively stable enemy occupation such changes are possible and they deserve special vigilance on the part of guerrilla commanders
2162624 let me once again categorically deny the slander that we are preparing to go underground for making preparations for a telangana type armed struggle to coincide with a future chinese invasion of our country if we have had any thought of going underground how is that myself instead of going underground had started setting up our party head quarters at new delhi and fixing up cadres for our english and hindi organs be published from there how is it that i had shifted my headquarters of our party
2162625 in a social set up overwhelmed by class exploitation there is no way one can expect democracy to function whatever little there is by way of democratic norms comes out of the womb of class struggle and is never a merciful gift of the ruling classes
2162626 economic struggle alone can never change the character of exploitation not can it end exploitation capture of state power alone can lead to a change in the correlation of production relationship
2162627 struggle is waged in various forms in and outside of the parliament towards the ultimate aim of winning of the state power by the working class
2162628 india a vast country inhabited by 105 crores of people rich and abundant in natural wealth is one of the strongest bases of imperialism and that is why the progress and success of the new democratic revolution of india directed against imperialism comprador big bourgeoisie and feudalism will not only liberate the indian people from the ruthless exploitation and oppression of imperialism but will also elevate to a new stage the struggle of the people of the whole world for independence democracy socialism and peace the success of the new democratic revolution of india and the establishment of a peoples democratic state in india will play an important role in accelerating the world proletarian revolution and will signify an important historical advancement towards the establishment of a new world free of imperialism capitalism and the exploitation of man by man
2162629 as a gesture of reciprocation the indian delegation invited a delegation of the seven party alliance in nepal to visit india at their convenience
2162630 there cannot be any question of india harbouring nepali maoists
2162631 on this wonderfully reasonable ground they denounce all criticism of parliamentarism as
2162632 to decide once every few years which member of the ruling class is to repress and crush the people through parliament this is the real essence of bourgeois parliamentarism not only in parliamentary constitutional monarchies but also in most democratic republics
2162633 one of the most vicious and probably most widespread distortions of marxism resorted to by the dominant
2162634 possibly the peasantry may seize all the land and all the power
2162635 revolutionary democratic phrases to lull the rural simple simons and bureaucracy and red tape to gladden the hearts of the capitalists this is the essence of the honest coalition
2162636 but by going through the process of reforming the social structure
2162637 war is the main form of struggle and army is the main form of organisation other forms such as mass organisation and mass struggle are also extremely important and indeed indispensable and in no circumstances to be overlooked but their purpose is to serve the war before the outbreak of a war all organisation and struggle are in preparation for war after war breaks out all organisations and struggle are coordinated with the war either directly or indirectly
2162638 in the guerrilla zones and in those areas where our work is going on with the task of forming liberated areas we should organize the people into struggles by rallying them around the following concrete slogans this takes place through the revolutionary peoples committees as part of the politics of capturing the state power 1 overthrow feudal authority establish peoples political power 2 take over the lands of the landlords the lands of the government and of other exploiting institutions and distribute them to the poor and landless peasants 4 stop repayment of debts and interests to landlords and moneylenders 5 stop paying taxes cess and levies to the government 6 right over the forest belongs to adivasis and the toiling people stop the plunder of forest wealth by imperialist cbb and big contractors 7 develop agriculture and cooperative movement increase production and achieve self reliance in every sphere the implementation of the above slogan by mobilizing all the anti feudal forces into struggle against imperialist exploitation and the exploitation of landlords and comprador bureaucrat bourgeoisie classes will be the immediate political task as a result of the political mobilization that takes place on the above slogans the peasantry will intensify the class struggle in the form of armed struggle in a big way it will provide innumerable warriors for the expansion of the plga and for the development of plga into the pla it will ripen the conditions for the establishment of the liberated area
2162639 1 we have to explain our understanding to the party members and other organizations in the village we must stabilize them in this work 2 we must provide an understanding to the people about the aim and objective of our development activities 3 the committee members must not stay in one area but move in the villages organize the people and implement the program adopted 4 we must not confine to crops but also adopt a plan for the needs of agriculture like cattle ploughs seeds and fertilizers 5 in addition to the collective work we have to support the farmers in their personal work like house works whenever possible 6 we have to form committees in the villages where until now we conducted without them 7 we have to prepare some more whole time activists 8 in addition to production we have to discuss and build movement political issues also
2162640 economism and that we shall never rid ourselves of this narrowness of our organizational activity until we rid ourselves of economism generally i
2162641 world bank has praised the left parties for their broad based vision on social sector and infrastructure development and said the up governments common minimum programme was in tune with the banks objectives it does not seem to be a red flag at all he said referring to the left parties
2162642 do on the road will not matter on the run way
2162643 historically all reactionary forces on the verge of extinction invariably conduct a last desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces and some revolutionaries are apt to be deluded for a time by this phenomenon of outward strength but inner weakness failing to grasp the essential fact that the enemy is nearing extinction while they themselves are approaching victory
2162644 we must act now when there is still time and hope we dare not to fail because the consequence of failure will be beyond our control
2162645 unless the green revolution is based on social justice i am afraid the green revolution may not remain green
2162646 if land reforms were not implemented soon and fully in the country green revolution would not remain green and might become red there would be upheaval in the rural areas
2162647 it is highly important to initiate movement among bargadars against the opportunist tendency prevailing among bargadars about not to cultivate properly or not to part with the share of the owners of the lands
2162648 the most distinct picture of our success lies in the fact that in our state 72 percent cultivable land is in the hands of the poor and marginal peasants 15 lakh bargadars have been recorded it is a fundamental matter after coming to power we have rescued 11 lakh acres of land and got it distributed this ownership character of cultivable land what we call land reforms within this structure
2162649 will also allow several plot holders to form a company and enter into agreement with potential investors in food processing and agribusiness the latest thrust area of buddhadeb bhattacharjee government
2162650 it is also essential to adopt modern technology for bringing about change in the crop pattern towards production of cash crops and increase in agricultural production it is not possible to tackle the situation unless the poor and marginal farmers have their access to irrigation fertilizers improved seeds agricultural implements etc
2162651 what bengal lacks is investment but the role of private investors is to help the farmers and any kind of contract cultivation should be mutually beneficial and not exploitative
2162652 despite playing very important role in the development of agriculture not the least of development has reached the khetmajoors
2162653 imagine that the growth of population and the evolution of technology have organized the entire globe that a single world city covers the usable surface of the earth
2162654 all progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art not only of robbing the workers but of robbing the soil all progress in increasing the fertility of soil for a given time is progress towards ruining the long lasting sources of that fertility the more a country proceeds form large scale industry as the background of its development as in the case of the united states the more rapid is this process of destruction capitalist production therefore only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original source of all wealth the soil and the workers
2162655 be necessarily conceived in discontinuous forms as rupture lurks in all that went before
2162656 finance capital dominates current day capitalism its expansion drives the imperialist assault on the economics of less developed countries its current offensive involves not just opening the markets of less developed countries to commodities and foreign direct investment form the advanced capitalist countries but also opening up the financial sector to permit free play of speculative finance in stock and capital markets in the search super profits the inflow of such capital imposes a sharp decline in public expenditure in the recipient countries
2162657 the struggle for an alternative socialist order has to be based on the revolutionary socialist formation of the existing order this is turn needs an engagement i e joining issues of the revolutionary forces with the existing world realities with the sole objective of changing the correlation of forces in favour of socialism
2162658 it is clearly seen in the programmes of the maoists that they think it that from within the existing state structure no development is possible they think that raising slogan for partial development amounts to committing betrayal of the revisionist path it is their idea that raising the slogan of development without arms in hand is synonymous with the act of agent dalali of the ruling class
2162659 it is a primary duty of government to provide for the health safety and convenience of the inhabitants of this great town by establishing a comprehensive system for the improvement of the roads streets
2162660 the appearance and beauty of the town are inseparably connected with the health safety and convenience of the inhabitants and every improvement which shall introduce a greater degree of order symmetry and magnificence in the streets roads will tend to ameliorate the climate and to promote and secure every object of a just and salutary system of police
2162661 the cpi m looks upon the question of development from a class outlook and against specific socio economic backdrop
2162662 the essential aim of this globalization is to destroy all barriers and to tie up the developing economies in such a way that makes it possible for the multi national corporations to extract super profit they are trying to attain this aim making use of this international wide trio the imf the world bank and the wto their aim is quite clear i e to make those developing countries as their colonies of financial exploitation
2162663 the world bank is distancing itself from the imf and we are doing business we intend to do on our terms again the world bank imf were very similar till four years back distance is emerging now yes they are listening they are not imposing
2162664 it is a wrong notion to brand us anti reforms let me make it absolutely clear that we are pro reforms we also understand that the process of economic reforms is irreversible all we want is that the reforms should have a human face
2162665 our relations with west bengal have strengthened over the last two years
2162666 is the british government department responsible for britains contribution towards international efforts to eliminate poverty
2162667 the british government believes that the elimination of global poverty is a matter of enlightened self interest poverty breeds insecurity and conflict it also undermines trade business and investment opportunities
2162668 in todays globalised world decisions made by western governments have an impact on poor people in developing countries dfid in the uk and overseas works to ensure that policies in different areas such as trade and investment debt relief and global environmental concerns consider and promote the needs of poor people
2162669 and if we dont take action now to reduce global inequality there is a real danger
2162670 the challenge is to connect more people from the worlds poorest countries with the benefits of the new global economy and that means globalization must be managed properly to benefit everyone
2162671 government in poorer countries have to create conditions at home that will help the poorest people in their communities find work or a market for their goods that will sustain their families its now widely accepted that efficient markets are indispensable for effective development developing countries must attract foreign investment
2162672 we the cpi m are not dogmatic with time our party has changed its stand on various issues we are open to change and have changed
2162673 dfid is working with the adb unicef and others and seeking opportunities to support public sector efficiency and initiatives to tackle the states fiscal situation with a focus on freeing up additional resources for pro poor spending dfid continues to follow up the fiscal reform agenda in a limited way with go wb govt of west bengal by proposing to support 28 million pound public sector enterprise restructuring programme
2162674 we have another understanding with dfid the money we save after the restructuring will be funded in social sector if you call it a conditionality we will agree
2162675 to clamp down once again an economic colonialism over third world nations
2162676 included a focus on states undertaking reforms in order to support the leaders of change and serve as a catalyst to the state level reform process
2162677 are engaged in a dialogue on cross cutting reforms that are focus of adjustment lending fiscal management governance service delivery the power sector and the investment climate regardless of their eligibility for adjustment lending adb has also had a longstanding engagement with west bengal
2162678 strengthening fiscal management and reallocating public resources to priority areas for the poor
2162679 steps to increase the voice of the poor and strengthen decentralization
2162680 greater resource mobilization form users and efforts to leverage scarce public funds with private funding
2162681 in the power distribution and transmission road water and sanitation and solid waste sectors involvement of the private sector needs to be encouraged through a variety of models including public private partnerships
2162682 go and tell the world that we are changing we marxists are not fools to cling to obsolete ideas in west bengal the left is right and this is the right place for to invest
2162683 as for the fiscal reforms i believe both the world bank and the west bengal government are finding many things common in their perception
2162684 mncs make financial investment in any country elsewhere not for the welfare of the people of the host country but for the maximization of their profits similar is the case with the big indigenous capitalists also
2162685 the cpi m considers the question of unnayan development from a class outlook and the concrete socio economic context
2162686 so the struggle for development means the struggle of the majority of the people of the country
2162687 while his government was trying to put north bengal on the path of development these elements were misleading the people in an effort to impede progress in the region
2162688 improvement of national highway 34 which is the artery of north south transport corridor and the eastward connection to the border of bangladesh
2162689 a strategic alliance with mall development and retail consultancy major asia property group with the help of nai nk entity to prepare the retail platform
2162690 the govt has changed its stands on using industrial land for industries alone they have taken the market route to unlock the land in closed industrial premises in and around the city the proposal entails some changes in the urban land ceiling and regulation act
2162691 everybody pays fees fees are much below the private sector and above the government sector
2162692 we are for hundred percent privatization of airport in west bengal
2162693 the work for industry and improving infrastructure is on course on the basis of land reforms and success in agricultural productions
2162694 inject a strong element of human rights and attitudinal changes into the thinking and functioning of the men and women in khaki
2162695 the villagers around sitapur under shyampur police station build up the police camp to receive police help in their danger about 2 lakh rupees was spent to built up this new police camp for receiving help to build the camp the local durga puja was cancelled for this year
2162696 the police staff gave away new clothes for the flood affected victims
2162697 in the bhadreshwar police station premises 300 distressed people were distributed cloths by the police staff
2162698 from all sides we have segregated the naxalites in this state
2162699 we have defeated them the maoist administratively politically and ideologically
2162700 the audacious assault conducted by the cpi maoist at the jehanabad jail raises serious questions of security and intelligence lapses
2162701 the communist party of india marxist strives to achieve the establishment of peoples democracy and socialist transformation through peaceful means
2162702 can neither replicate the russian or chinese or for matter of any other experience in the world
2162703 such violence is often described as left extremism in the process there is a concerted attempt to denounce communism as fostering a cult of violence and equating anarchism with revolutionary activities
2162704 such anarchic violence of the maoists with the revolutionary work that the cpi m is engaged in
2162705 ich habe einen tolles wort gefunden und so nenne ich meine marke chichipatli
2162706 was nee oder das kannst du nicht machen mach das bloss nicht
2162707 chichipatli ist das alte aztekenwort f r dahlie bevor der botaniker herr dahl die blumen nach sich benannte und weil ich doch haupts chlich florale motive habe da dachte ich da hab ich mir gedacht na gut dann nehm ich eben ein anderes aztekenwort acocotli das bedeutet auch dahlie
2162708 con esos 100 dolares podria haber comprado 1 galon de combustible
2162709 when you get to this point of the year there are no flukes
2162710 unless you have a huge setback youre going to be there all year long
2162711 theres no question its going to be a three team race the rest of the way it would be nice if it was a one team race but that would be no fun
2162712 i think its because he does it in a non glamorous fashion he doesnt blow guys away or shatter bats or get a lot of strikeouts but hes the type of guy who can frustrate an opponent because you look up in the sixth inning and youre being shut out
2162713 when you have a sinker it doesnt matter if the opposing team is looking for it
2162714 when he has his sinker he can go six shutout innings like tonight
2162715 ground ball pitchers can always work themselves out of trouble
2162716 at the same time kyle is good enough to get himself out of trouble youve got to give him credit for that

2162734 blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ the father of mercies and god of all comfort who comforts us in all our affliction so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by god
2162735 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
2162736 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
2162737 but god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
2162738 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god not by works so that no one can boast
2162739 here i am i stand at the door and knock if anyone hears my voice and opens the door i will come in and eat with him and he with me

2162748 what obama represents is we as a people are part of the american dream
2162749 we were left out of the dream at a certain point now the dream is you can be anything and its not cliche

2162755 for legal and practical purposes freeman and colley lee have been separated since december of 2007
2162756 we stuck with that with both kids good irish and good biblical names were just blessed to have such a beautiful family
2162757 i wish it wasnt the design of the universe that we have to learn things the hard way but it is
2162758 its a very big surprise in life when you learn that not everyone is rooting for you
2162759 thats something we cultivate every day that sense of separateness and being together at the same time
2162760 if my mom had one wish i think it would be that i was more ladylike
2162761 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2162762 the results we have published today demonstrate progress in a number of important areas and it is all the more unsatisfactory therefore that they record a loss as a result of our credit market write downs

2162765 the dollar is a factor but the dominant factor is the perception that high oil prices coupled with slower economic growth in developed countries will curb oil demand
2162766 the disruptions to that pipeline have provided some support to oil prices
2162767 looking ahead based on the current prices for futures commodities the annual inflation rate is likely to remain well above a level consistent
2162768 it should not have come as surprise to anyone that on balance the bank of england felt it could do nothing but sit tight this month a situation that is likely to prevail for a few more months
2162769 calling all quantum theorists and cosmologists who can be patient with innumerate humanists and theists
2162770 now why is it that the collapse of the wave function is so worrisome to theorists
2162771 we can cope with randomness if we have clear rules for when to use it we know how to use it for water splashing and rifle shots
2162772 the problem is that quantum mechanics obeys one rule between measurements and another when a measurement occurs
2162773 this would be fine if somebody could tell me what a measurement is so there are two different rules and no sure way to know which one should be used that is the problem
2162774 the quantum nature of the universe is at the wrong energy scale for addressing questions of god or a soul the issues surrounding john mccain are far more relevant
2162775 a foolishness to the greeks and to the jews a stumbling block
2162776 but then why dont you expect an underlying mechanism to be found that will explain both behaviors in one theory
2162777 gavin are there measurements made in nature without any intentional observer or measurer or a measuring machine made by such
2162778 like a photon hitting an eyeball is that a measurement
2162779 name something god or the soul does that i cannot account for in other ways scientifically
2162780 that which is possible according either to probability or necessity
2162781 we observe certain phenomenon or instances we then try to create a form mathematical equations which we can use to reproduce an equivalent instance to the one observed the form is validated when it can not only predict an equivalent instance but can be used to predict other observable instances the laws of motion work for dropping balls from the tower of pisa as well as the movement of the planets

2162783 this was a very cool summer hardly like a summer at all more like late winter
2162784 this is the winter of our discontent made glorious summer by this son of york
2162785 god is the name we use to refer to the nature of those potentialities as potentialities and therefore the name of their source and their direction even if those are internal to universe itself
2162786 this is the fundamental human reaction to nature and even the non theistic scientists share it as long as it isnt called
2162787 speaking as a religious scholar i think youll have to be careful about that first one since in order to put forth any argument at all youll have to very precisely define which conception of
2162788 name one thing that art has done that makes a difference
2162789 how can i be respectful of non empirical knowledge in some cases and then oppose these other ways of knowing in other cases
2162790 the information were getting in now is that if the markets correct themselves we may see some selling off of cellulosic ethanol ipos initial public offerings mid to late next year which would obviously bring the spotlight back to the biofuel market and thats a positive
2162791 dramatic growth in the solar market is expected in italy france and greece also high profile acquisitions within the solar power value chain by large non solar buyers germanys bosch and frances schneider electric are key examples have bolstered sentiment in solar shares
2162792 when you look at the industries and the companies that make up the industries youre dealing with things in alternative clean renewable and sustainable energy that are of substance that have markets that far exceed any other market in the world and these are actual operating companies

2162806 i have one friend who always orders in english at restaurants even though she speaks mandarin
2162807 i asked her why and she said its because the service is noticeably better
2162808 regrettably it cannot cater for every wish of the tenant

2162820 tightening credit in three consecutive quarters has not helped in lowering inflation
2162821 squeezing credit is essentially squeezing credit for the organized sector
2162822 if this kind of strict monetary policy is followed further we are apprehensive
2162823 we have to see what happens in the future this is a time when the inflation rate is not something we need to panic about
2162824 subtle changes in industry growth rates are often far outweighed by fluctuations in market share and pricing amongst the it hardware vendors
2162825 as a result we prefer companies with upward market share bias and we believe it will be difficult to find a near term bottom for companies with declining or rigid market share
2162826 we anticipate that apple will continue to grow at a multiple of the overall market for many years to come

2162828 pictures of a polar bear floating precariously on a tiny iceberg have become the defining image of global warming but may be misleading according to a new study
2162829 there arent just a few more bears there are a hell of a lot more bears
2162830 contrary to concern over a celebrated photograph of a bear and its cub floating on a tiny iceberg the animals often travel in that way he said
2162831 bears will often hang out on glacier ice or large pieces of multi year ice

2162843 our view is that the market has some upside potential to it but were not all that optimistic
2162844 we think that economic growth continues to deteriorate both here in the u s and globally
2162845 we wanted to present star wars in a different way in a more dynamic way through animation and push the envelope
2162846 the computer is a tool i mean its just like a hammer and chisel for a sculptor or needle and thread for a seamstress its just another tool that we can employ to make entertainment for the masses
2162847 a character rigger is kind of a digital puppet maker
2162848 we have so many planets we visit so many creature and characters and vehicles and its all sci fi too so its all in your mind as far as how you want to approach those sounds and create them
2162849 my blatant attempt to latch on to someone elses fame and hopefully get myself a job outside of a dying media
2162850 unprofessional you wouldnt see you professionals in sales go to meetings like that
2162851 i was thinking about reconciliation and in doing debriefing for many years in our home office this was often the hardest issue people would come back with issues they had with staff missionaries japanese that were never reconciled and probably never would be
2162852 if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you first go and be reconciled to your brother then come and offer your gift
2162853 be completely humble and gentle be patient bearing with one another in love make every effort to keep the unity of the spirit through the bond of peace

2162858 there are alot of snowballs in club penguin ready to kick your
2162859 im very sorry were not tokyoplastic theyve pulled out at the last minute
2162860 it paves the way for another kind of targeted therapy against these cancers
2162861 we have identified the process by which the cell is switched off what we now have to get is the detailed structural information by which that occurs and then we can develop drugs that mimic that process
2162862 the development of those drugs is probably five to 10 years away
2162863 i tried to obtain him on loan last season and am absolutely delighted to eventually get him to tannadice
2162864 he is a very direct player with lots of pace and is a natural and proven goalscorer
2162865 so he could not hear her prosecutor rick raymond told the court

2162867 our intention has always been to deliver the benefits of renewable energy while minimizing any impact to the environment
2162868 we were meticulous in the way we approached the development of this wind farm which we believe will be used as a model for future wind farms around the country
2162869 until we see the written decision we cannot make any decision regarding appeal
2162870 negotiations are ongoing between the state and federal governments over whether this change is a minor or a significant one
2162871 as he gets older i think he will appreciate being here more and more
2162872 the longer people stay at this club you tend to not want to leave
2162873 rio ferdinand is an obvious example of that but really im just pleased we have managed to put all this real madrid stuff to bed they know what they are dealing with now
2162874 there has been some criticism in the media of the premier league with a call for quotas to guarantee english players starting places in teams
2162875 i did not start the final of the champions league with six englishmen because i was making a political statement i did it because theyre good enough to win the european cup
2162876 it is nonsense to say that england does not have players capable of competing on the international stage
2162877 the hysteria surrounding englands non qualification for euro 2008 does not create the right atmosphere for good decision making
2162878 the letter was forwarded to north melbourne chief executive eugene arocca who passed it on to police
2162879 the club can make no further comment on the issue as it is subject to an ongoing investigation by victoria police
2162880 please respect the privacy of nathan and his family as this sensitive issue is resolved
2162881 the strongest indication i can give you is that we want to pass on an interest rate cut if funding costs allow
2162882 at the end of the day were a commercial organisation
2162883 clearly we would love to pass through the full 25 basis points drop if that were to occur but well need to factor in all of those issues at that time
2162884 i say to the commercial banks in australia that they have a responsibility to ensure that action by the reserve bank is reflected in the interest rate posture adopted by those commercial banks
2162885 where they are increasing interest rates which are not in line with peoples expectations of what they are reasonably able to do in variable home loans then perhaps they are engaging in unfair or even unconscionable conduct
2162886 its highly probable that we will be making an application for compensation
2162887 it is a fantastic pitch to bat on there was hardly anything for bowlers it is just that we did not bat well we should have scored more runs
2162888 but i still feel we are very much in the game if we get one or two early wickets in the morning tomorrow we will be right back in the game
2162889 they have a good batting line up one of my favourite players is sachin and it was a big moment for me to take his wicket i am really happy
2162890 although it is my first test i had played a warm up game against them and got three wickets and that gave me some confidence i knew i could do it
2162891 we had other programming commitments and respect for other audiences so we cant keep all the people happy all the time
2162892 the ratings results from thursday for make me a supermodel and the soccer show the decision was vindicated
2162893 it is dangerous and highly toxic because the message to teenage girls is that their own prospects of success are based on body image and how to market themselves sexually
2162894 a vast number of football fans were not able to see it live
2162895 showing the game live was something we certainly discussed with the australian olympic committee and channel 7
2162896 there would have been an enormous number of football followers across the country who would have wanted to watch the game live
2162897 by far universals most ambitious dvd originaltm to date the scorpion king 2 rise of a warrior raises the made for dvd bar to the next level with production values that deliver theatrical style action adventure and excitement
2162898 our strong track record in this arena has encouraged us to pursue this market even more aggressively as of late with continuing to successfully build on its global popularity and appeal at the box office we saw a unique opportunity to offer home entertainment consumers a new engaging experience that embraces the iconic elements they love about this franchise
2162899 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2162900 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2162901 moving backward to a time where supplies of corn outpaced demand is not a possibility we applaud the epas decision not to grant the waiver
2162902 the renewable fuels standard is part of our nations energy solution americas farmers have the ability to produce a safe abundant food supply while playing a part in reducing our dependence on foreign oil
2162903 the food versus fuel myth is not based on the facts
2162904 the renewable fuels standard is particularly important for rural america where ethanol production has revitalized once struggling communities
2162905 the increase in corn expected to be used in ethanol between 2006 07 and 2008 09 may account for up to 60 percent of the increase in corn prices between 2006 07 and 2008 09
2162906 a better model for the july 3rd price spike would seem to be the enron market manipulation of the henry hub forward market on july 19 2001 in this case enron purchased a large quantity of spot gas and took advantage of the price increase to sell at an artificial price in the forward markets enrons positions dramatically exceeded the levels that would provide legitimate economic hedges
2162907 mr mcculloughs research clearly shows that oil prices are no longer tied to supply and demand
2162908 statistically this research shows that prices are spiking absent of a crisis like a natural disaster or supply disruption however prices then fell when congress began serious debate on how to crack down on those who may be trying to manipulate the markets research shows that traders may well be in control of the market not supply and demand and consumers have been left paying the price
2162909 given the probability that market participants have a very good idea of the market shares and pricing there is no logical public policy reason why this information should not be accumulated and provided to regulators and decision makers
2162910 is worse than useless because it provides the illusion of market surveillance while allowing sufficient room for any offender to escape observation
2162911 i am a kansas city sports fan but im a baseball fan more than anything
2162912 to be able to come to shea with all the history and the fact theres going to be a new stadium next season is really cool
2162913 i want to reiterate on his behalf that the united states supports georgias territorial integrity we urge all parties georgians south ossetians and russians to de escalate the tension and avoid conflict
2162914 its gotta be really exciting thinking about marching in that stadium and representing our country
2162915 we appreciate all the hard work youve put in to get to this spot
2162916 we want you to win as many golds as you possibly can
2162917 where you may be asking is this right not to be exploited and abused guaranteed
2162918 can you get this camera out of my face for two seconds im trying to nap here
2162919 i could not give the coach any guarantee that i would continue to play football when my one year contract with stuttgart ends
2162920 thats why i told them that they should not plan with me any longer for the national team
2162921 ive had a great time in the national team over the past few years the world cup in 2006 especially was fascinating and a unique experience for me
2162922 it was a good talk we were absolutely on the same wavelength in evaluating the situation
2162923 i thanked him for great performances our success at the 2006 world cup is linked closely to his name because of the penalty shootout against argentina he also played a big role in our success at euro 2008
2162924 how long will it take not to be sad anymore
2162925 require all recipients of aid under federal health programs to certify that they will not refuse to hire nurses and other providers who object to
2162926 any of the various procedures including the prescription dispensing and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
2162927 i feel very grown up now yes i am an adult
2162928 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
2162929 as a young guy it is a big honor for me to play at the opening ceremony and to represent a new generation of chinese people to the world
2162930 im part of a new generation in china enjoying a very different way of life from our parents we love american culture and classical music but we also have strong chinese traditions
2162931 the worldwide expectation of and best wishes for the beijing olympic games has helped cement friendship between the chinese people and the world people
2162932 chinas century long dream of the olympiad will finally become reality thanks to the unremitting efforts of several generations
2162933 simply spend more time with people if you feel uncomfortable in social situations thats probably because you arent in them frequently
2162934 the menu should be as informative of what its effect is on ones waistline as it is on their pocketbooks
2162935 not ingesting 800 calories in a meal makes a huge difference to ones health and quality of life
2162936 i wasnt really expecting to qualify for this olympics so i am just looking forward to getting some experience
2162937 i want to go out and have fun if i do something wrong ill let it go if i do something well then i will take that experience into 2012
2162938 diving in china is quite a big sport so you do get people recognising you around the place
2162939 its kind of weird because when you are little you dream of being famous its weird to become that person you dont expect it to happen to you
2162940 tom is like a breath of fresh air to have around and to dive with
2162941 i have been in the sport for 21 years this is my first olympics and tom has helped me get here
2162942 i am hoping to go onto 2012 hopefully his energy and enthusiasm will keep me going until then
2162943 he has had a positive impact on the team he copes with things very well and his presence encourages people to raise their game
2162944 i think its fantastic for the world of diving to have a non chinese star we saw that with canadas alexandre despatie who won a gold medal at the 1998 commonwealth games aged just 13
2162945 someone like tom is another name to watch out for
2162946 there are a lot of countries out there with fantastic divers but this is a great stepping stone for him
2162947 i used to have problems sleeping the night before competing but i asked sir steve about it and he told me you can perform just as well without good sleep
2162948 that really helped me and i sleep much better now
2162949 the coin must have been done by a professional the work is impressive
2162950 our goal when the legislation takes effect is to make it easy for paypal merchants who fall under the provision to report their taxable incomes
2162951 all the threads that hold a community together a common identity role models a sense of safety were given by young people as motivations to join gangs
2162952 these interventions which have been in use for many years are unlikely to be more effective than no treatment
2162953 as a direct result of the lack of evidence many couples with unexplained infertility endure and even request expensive potentially hazardous and often unnecessary treatments
2162954 im a gamer and the chance to act in one of the best loved game franchises was an opportunity i was really keen to explore especially as eva is such a strong female character the worlds of gaming and film are getting ever closer and as an actress i wanted to explore this exciting new area of drama broaden my acting skills and continue the active outgoing side of my personality that i showed in im a celebrity
2162955 its great to have gemma on board for such a popular gamers game as command amp conquer red alert 3 we hope that fans of both gemma and the command amp conquer universe will be delighted at what they see when the game goes on sale in october she will also be taking part in ea s be the one event in trafalgar square later this year which forms part of the london games festival

2162962 we became alarmed a couple of days ago when we saw he wasnt sweating like he should
2162963 when these kids try to make weight sometimes they cut corners what we believe is he did not increase his fluid intake after we told him to
2162964 we thought he was a very good shot at a medal
2162965 we try to tell the team when we have these types of adversities we still have eight guys in there and were going to try to concentrate on what weve got
2162966 ive just always thought winning a gold medal would mean more than being a world champion or winning all that money or anything
2162967 nuclear power takes too long to build is too expensive too risky and unsafe nuclear power is not the solution to help texas meet its power needs there are cheaper cleaner and more sustainable energy solutions
2162968 the rush to build new nuclear power plants is simply an attempt to take advantage of federal subsidies while they are available and then hope to pass the building operating and decommissioning costs and any liability from accidents off on the public
2162969 and then hope to pass the building operating and decommissioning costs and any liability from accidents off on the public
2162970 robbie coltrane is not the burglar but imagine him aged 16 with lank greasy hair and you have the picture
2162971 he is 16 years old lives locally travels by bicycle and burgles houses in your street
2162972 he will break windows to gain entry and ransack the property targeting electronic items cash and jewellery
2162973 i couldnt believe it i went to follow and there it was sitting up on bricks
2162974 its just an ordinary holden wagon a few years old nothing special so i hope they got their kicks using my wheels for their street drags or whatever and leaving me stranded
2162975 its disgraceful in a hospital car park i couldnt believe it
2162976 hayley is a midwife and nurse at sunshine and you just cant believe people would do this in a hospital car park
2162977 the granting of an injunction to restrain the defendants conduct abroad is not futile if the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction and his assets are within the jurisdiction
2162978 the presence of assets in the jurisdiction means that if the injunction is not complied with by the defendant it will be open to the plaintiff to seek an order for their seizure
2162979 central to the structure of rugby league and our future plans
2162980 current methods are not optimising consumer engagement and are failing to influence the consumer in any significant way
2162981 i believe it to be the biggest deal thats been done
2162982 there have been 185 000 telephone intercepts in this operation and there have been 400 members of the afp deployed to this operation
2162983 there have also been 10 000 hours of surveillance deployed to this operation to find the perpetrators of this worlds largest seizure and importation into our country
2162984 it is classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down the syndicate
2162985 there have been 185 000 telephone intercepts in this operation and there have been 400 members of the afp deployed to this operation
2162986 there have also been 10 000 hours of surveillance deployed to this operation to find the perpetrators of this worlds largest seizure and importation into our country
2162987 it is classic organised crime and we have done our best to shut down the syndicate
2162988 there are not many boardrooms in australia where you would write off half a billion dollars worth of a commodity or a product and continue your business
2162989 what we have to do is reach out to the youth of the country and reduce demand
2162990 it just seems to be a scandalous waste they want to dig up one of the most prized parks possibly two in hammersmith and fulham
2162991 for them to propose the park plan when they had this piece of land here where they are building luxury flats is quite frankly a disgrace
2162992 the mayor is keen to improve the oyster card to make it even more attractive for londoners and tfl will work to make sure this happens both quickly and in a way that represents the best value
2162993 tfl will ensure the continuity of the brand in future arrangements
2162994 we are looking at more cost effective ways to manage and develop the oyster card system that we expect will save millions over the next few years
2162995 the london transport system has changed dramatically over the past 10 years
2162996 but when i looked at the envelope it was in i noticed it was royal mail and it said that this item had been delayed in the post
2162997 you expect sometimes letters to be a couple of days late but 79 years is taking the mickey a bit
2162998 it looks like the picture was taken a couple of years after the memorial was first built because it looks absolutely pristine
2162999 this was posted in 1929 so i would say these two girls would have to be over 21 to go away on their own
2163000 id say theyre in their 90s now if theyre still alive at all
2163001 it is impossible to determine exactly what has happened to this item of mail
2163002 it is very unlikely however that it has been in the royal mail system for that length of time
2163003 im really excited its a great honour for my country its a terrific feeling my country is very very great
2163004 i came here because i wanted to feel the environment and lots of chinese people have come together
2163005 this is amazing for them they are supposed to be in their english class this afternoon but for days they have been asking if they could come down here its wonderful
2163006 i get quite emotional about things like this ive just phoned my parents to tell them im watching this in trafalgar square to make them jealous its pretty amazing to be watching it here
2163007 we are here together today because we need the chinese government to talk about human rights the situation in tibet and media freedom
2163008 the olympics shouldnt have been offered to china on the basis of their human rights record but from this there have been positives as the attention of the world is now on china and their human rights record is in the spotlight
2163009 theyre throwing everything theyve got at this event itll be very hard for us to compete with that
2163010 now by sharing in game advertising revenue were allowing a more diversified business model that gives our partners more resources to create new innovative titles for the 13 million people we see every month on msn games
2163011 its just one day when teenagers can get away from their parents and have fun and listen to music
2163012 you produced a knife and stabbed vincent through the heart killing him an act of ruthless violence on a helpless victim in pursuit of gain and what turned out to be a trivial amount of cannabis
2163013 we consider that justice has been done but also know that despite these sentences nothing will bring donald back
2163014 we will have to live the rest of our lives without the joy he brought to us all and know that the pain and suffering will never go away
2163015 as a family we forgive those who committed these acts against donald and the man who killed him
2163016 therefore reducing methane production is an attractive short term target for mitigating
2163017 the change will require large cultural and social adjustments and reinvestment one of the impediments to change is protective legislation and the status of kangaroos as a national icon
2163018 to v or not to v that is the question
2163019 this is part of a global international syndicate it is classic organised
2163020 this is what makes getting up in the morning and coming to work worthwhile
2163021 its been a long journey over the last two years
2163022 we still have a lot of improving to do but we did some things very well tonight this will be good for the players confidence we had a few lapses and we need to learn from that in the next games
2163023 i cant deny it was an important issue there are very few players who left me against my will
2163024 madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here
2163025 he has got four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully we would like to extend it
2163026 were happy he has explained himself perfectly from my perspective and the matter is closed he is a manchester united player
2163027 the player is happy to be a manchester united player he has always been happy to be here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him
2163028 the important thing is we ended all this stuff about real madrid as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont ever want to leave
2163029 when we are driving x and you change the radio station without asking y i feel like i dont matter to you
2163030 you being an hour late x for our appointment y makes me feel you think our appointment isnt important and that makes me sad z
2163031 i would like you to be on time next time that we we can spend some time catching up before dinner
2163032 robbie keane is the best signing the club could have made anyone would want him in their team hes the signing of the summer
2163033 liverpool needed a striker so that steven gerrard could go back in his favourite midfield position
2163034 we needed a creative and a hard working forward who can link midfield and attack and robbie keane is perfect for that role
2163035 im confident theyll do well but i dont think theyll win the league
2163036 i think they are closer to the top but it will still be between
2163037 at one point we were 30 odd points off the top but last season they were only 11 off
2163038 you have to be realistic and i think getting closer to the top and finishing third would be a success
2163039 you always want to see more investment in the club and im no different well just have to wait and see
2163040 we needed a second striker but barry is a good holding midfielder so he would be the icing on the cake
2163041 it is an ideal opportunity to sharpen up before a very important game and it will be ideal preparation
2163042 it is always interesting before the season starts to measure yourselves with the top teams in other countries because it gives you a little bit of a view of how well you can do in europe if you qualify
2163043 now that we are in different countries we agree more times
2163044 i agree totally playing other teams in europe and would choose that for my pre season
2163045 we have played against bayern munich and now we are against dutch and the spanish
2163046 i think it is very important to play against different philosophies of football and tactics to make things difficult for ourselves
2163047 it is vital that the game takes a step back and concentrates on making the right choices
2163048 we have the strongest and the most entertaining league in the world we should celebrate that not denigrate it
2163049 last season proved once again that as well as being the hardest league in the world to win its also the best
2163050 there has been some criticism in the media of the premier league this year with a call for quotas to guarantee english players starting places in teams
2163051 i did not start the final of the uefa champions league with six englishmen because i was making a political statement i did it because theyre good enough to win the european cup
2163052 it is nonsense to say that england does not have players capable of competing on the international stage
2163053 the hysteria surrounding englands non qualification for euro 2008 does not create the right atmosphere for good decision making
2163054 trashy b movie trailers and films projected during the bands
2163055 we will continue to invent the future through our blood and tears and through all our sadness we are the hokies we will prevail we will prevail we will prevail we are virginia tech
2163056 who is himself humbled before necessity compels him to humble another
2163057 im put here by my constituents and its to them i owe my allegiance taking the oath to an unelected person is a nonsense
2163058 i swear by almighty god that i will be faithful and bear true allegiance to her majesty queen elizabeth her heirs and successors according to law so help me god
2163059 we need to make the oath something that people are offered rather than required to take
2163060 i wouldnt drop the oath i would make it optional
2163061 for travelers a great vacation is all about escaping for most that means escaping the confines of their homes for others it is best achieved by escaping the confines of their clothes
2163062 everyone is just there to relax and enjoy the sun and to unwind i cannot think of a better place to do all of those things
2163063 good food and good company in enchanting surroundings one can spend a day totally relaxing or exploring the waters and islands nearby
2163064 rdas have failed in their core mission to narrow the gap between the economic performance of englands regions
2163065 rdas are massive and unaccountable spending machines leaking money top right and centre
2163066 the core problem is the eu divides up europe into net little regional boxes when shelling out cash and while this fits french regions nicely the uk has nothing comparable
2163067 rdas do waste cash but the taxpayers alliances broad brush analysis does not show how cash is wasted
2163068 the figures do add up but there are all sorts of other factors which could have caused this not least of all the simple fact of a cyclical economy
2163069 rdas work to boost investment economic development and regeneration and provide business support they promote enterprise in disadvantaged areas offer skills and training and help link up businesses and universities to foster business innovation
2163070 in addition rdas work to support uk exporters in overseas markets and to attract foreign direct investment to their regions
2163071 between 2002 and 2008 rda initiatives attracted investment of 8 2bn into deprived areas
2163072 labours regional quangos are too distant from local people compete among themselves and merely jump to the tune of whitehall
2163073 the artificial government office regions are simply not the best framework for delivering regeneration and development funding
2163074 while the forecast is controversial and extremely bullish even allowing for some increase in capacity over the next few years a supply crunch appears likely around 2013
2163075 the implication is that it will quickly translate into a price spike although there is a question over how strategic stocks might be used to alleviate this
2163076 we now accept that the story was untrue and that he is not suffering from any such condition
2163077 we unreservedly apologize both to him and to his family for making this distressing allegation and for breaching his privacy
2163078 buckingham palace has always maintained that members of the royal family have a right to privacy particularly in relation to their personal health
2163079 for this reason we have always refused to confirm or deny the persistent rumors that circulate about their health particularly during the quieter news months
2163080 i have said on a number of occasions that we are looking at all the options and stamp duty is one of them but ive also always said that stamp duty and removing it in itself may not kick start the market in the way that people think it might
2163081 we know for example that deposits have gone up because the old mortgages have gone and now lenders are asking for bigger deposits
2163082 stamp duty for the people who pay it and many people who dont represents a small amount of the upfront costs so we have to look at all these issues to make sure we get it right
2163083 its a really tough time what we have done is put 10m behind more debt advice for people weve now got a situation where 90 per cent of our county courts now have free legal advice and we know that if people get the right advice something like 85 per cent of repossessions can be avoided
2163084 but we are also looking at more ways in which we can help people facing difficulties thats why im looking at a mortgage rescue scheme which i announced a few weeks ago but also we are looking at a range of options across government working with treasury to see what we can do
2163085 for every one you sell 10 get downloaded but its technology you aint gonna stop it now
2163086 the hammerschmidt mansion is one of the first impressions visitors receive of our community and not only is it a visual treasure but one of the only remaining queen anne homes along chicago avenue
2163087 it is not simply a residence but a work of art a show piece of a bygone era and a visual focal point for the area
2163088 they have made it public and very much aware out there that they are prepared to sell the property to anybody who is willing to purchase it with landmark status for their purchase price and their closing costs and caring costs
2163089 its unfortunate that a few people are trying to impose their will on someone else the property today is beyond maintenance and it would take close to 1 million to put this property back in a condition that would be acceptable
2163090 anyone that has lived in naperville more than a year or two knows this home if there was ever a landmark home in town this has to be at the top or near it
2163091 she would come home from school and would immediately take off her braces and crawl around on the floor
2163092 its a pretty unusual wish and i dont think weve had others like it in illinois
2163093 she could have chosen to go to a hannah montana concert or take a trip to disney or something and she would have been happy for a night or one week
2163094 this is something that was going to benefit her forever
2163095 shes made great gains and shes one of those kids who really wanted to stay and do more
2163096 when i started i did not think i could take 100 steps
2163097 she can go on the swing climb up the ladder slide down the slide everything we do
2163098 shes in therapy for four hours we get home and even we are exhausted but she still wants to keep going and asks to go on the treadmill
2163099 shes a little workhorse she sees the progress and wants to keep it up
2163100 i realized it like a month ago so ive been excited about it since then
2163101 has been talking about her golden birthday since she could read a calendar
2163102 that we realized that this would be a pretty special day
2163103 i am a pacifist therefore i oppose and call for an immediate end to all works of war in iraq afghanistan columbia and everywhere else in the world i advocate non violent solutions in all situations of conflict
2163104 the morally right course of action in any situation is the one that produces the greatest balance of benefits over harms for everyone affected so long as a course of action produces maximum benefits for everyone utilitarianism does not care whether the benefits are produced by lies manipulation or coercion
2163105 this is who i am this is how i am defined
2163106 truly i tell you unless you change and become like children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
2163107 these tech savvy smart alecks have figured out that if you report a blog you dont like you can do some damage to a person
2163108 golden bees were making white combs and sweet honey from my old failures
2163109 im just doing knick knack art basically i want my work to be as clich as possible
2163110 my desire to leave is still as strong but there is nothing more to do now other than hope for a miracle
2163111 i understand perfectly well that if i dont move on now i probably never will
2163112 im just hoping that one fine morning the bosses at gazprom will wake up in a good mood and say weve had enough of arshavins whining lets let him go
2163113 but after ramos called me personally and told me that that they were selling robbie keane and that he wanted me in his side the situation changed
2163114 when a coach shows an interest in you especially such a renowned and strong coach then that is already half of the success of any move
2163115 the discussion didnt take long and we agreed on everything quickly only then did my asking price go up
2163116 tottenham have a decent squad with luka modric dimitar berbatov and other players and the club is fully capable of fighting for a place in the champions league
2163117 the main thing is to try my strengths in a league like the english premier league and play against the likes of arsenal on a regular basis rather than once every five years
2163118 there is no set time period or deadline for this zenit are doing everything in the correct way liverpool for 25 million euros then in my opinion they should pay good money for arshavin
2163119 my child i know you have been contemplating on the message i gave you but my message for you is still the same find your happiness from within
2163120 we are here because china is the main supporter of the military regime
2163121 we want the chinese government to understand the actual cost of their support to the people inside of burma
2163122 china can help our democratization process by putting pressure on the military regime
2163123 we will never forget we will never give up 1988
2163124 ive totally lost hope that change will come through mass protests
2163125 its difficult to organize protests now because most of the leaders are in jail or in hiding
2163126 i cannot participate the way i did in 1988 i am older now and have a family to take care of
2163127 those were the days and i dont expect demonstrations of that scale to ever take place again in the country
2163128 a lot of people are saying what has gone wrong
2163129 as the world celebrates the opening of the beijing olympics people should pause to remember the atrocities in burma 20 years ago
2163130 this anniversary is testament to the burmese peoples enduring demand for freedom and to the worlds failure to end repressive military rule
2163131 by the great courage and solidarity of the chinese people
2163132 its inevitable that people from different countries may not see eye to eye
2163133 so we should try to expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
2163134 they want those leaders to confirm the fact that china has returned to great power prominence in the world
2163135 they really want to say to the people of china that we the communist party of china have done a great job
2163136 all day today theyve been bombing georgia from numerous warplanes and specifically targeting the civilian population and we have scores of wounded and dead among the civilian population all around the country
2163137 my country is in self defense against russian aggression russian troops invaded georgia
2163138 will not allow the deaths of our compatriots to go unpunished
2163139 my duty as russian president is to safeguard the lives and dignity of russian citizens wherever they are this is what is behind the logic of the steps we are undertaking now
2163140 all of us hundreds of thousands of georgians here and abroad should come together unite and fight to save georgia we are a freedom loving people and if our nation is united no aggressor will be able to harm it
2163141 a large part of the city has been destroyed over 15 civilians have been killed several buildings are on fire in the city center and the local parliament building has burned down
2163142 street fighting in tskhinvali has lasted for many hours ossetian home guards are using grenade launchers to destroy georgian tanks eyewitnesses say tanks are burning throughout the city the turning point is approaching in the battle for the capital city
2163143 these troops that are in georgia now they didnt come unexpectedly
2163144 they had been amassing at the border for the last few months they claimed they were staging exercises there and as soon as a suitable pretext was found they moved in
2163145 we are planning to conduct a full and thorough investigation
2163146 inadvertently killing four women and a child located with them
2163147 this resolution expands the range of restrictive measures adopted by the u n security council
2163148 show restraint when granting new public loans for trade with iran to also be vigilant on activities taken by financial institutions with banks based in iran
2163149 although the training was somniferous i hope everyone managed to learn something from the course
2163150 we dont all have to do it the same we dont have to all be in service at the same time we do need to stand together for the things we do agree upon
2163151 i shared my faith vision and they said were going to walk this faith journey with you
2163152 after 100 days in the hospital and three surgeries i promised god i was going to fulfill my lifes mission to create more disciples of christ
2163153 it wasnt the demographics or anything like that it was just a strong sense through the lord
2163154 its just where all of the opportunities and the doors have opened
2163155 weve been sent to the area to not do something new but to build on all the great christian history thats already in the area
2163156 i want to be one of the agents that will bring all of the christian churches in lombard together because we are so much more powerful together than we are apart
2163157 isnt a english class nor is it a test of intelligence
2163158 excuse me can you please hand me the remote control thank you
2163159 eminem murdered you on your own you a dick riding you love the attention
2163160 oh well we where beaten guess we need to quit and let nicer people do this
2163161 industrial surplus overstock parts and repair to reduce operating costs
2163162 now we dont know its just one of those things where you hope for the best but well have to wait and see
2163163 as we have stated all along chicago is fully committed to building the entire program
2163164 popejoys decision moves us one step closer to realizing that goal
2163165 chicago has failed to show how they plan to pay for this misguided billion dollar boondoggle
2163166 if chicago cannot prove there is an adequate funding mechanism bulldozing our town will be a wasteful unnecessary and cruel burden on the people of bensenville
2163167 i am now satisfied by the fact that the environmental protection agencies and other agencies can continue to oversee this project should there be violations of regulations codes or the like
2163168 further delay creates inordinate safety issues pertaining to the existence of vacant unoccupied structures
2163169 it is not that they are not needed in elgin
2163170 it is just that in this case they are needed in chicago
2163171 if there are other cities experiencing problems that need help i think that is a good use of resources
2163172 it really upsets me because we all make dumb mistakes
2163173 but tony was not the only one to do it i really dont want to relive what i had to go through four years ago
2163174 this project is like a corpse sitting in a room
2163175 i think the public is beginning to lose respect for this board
2163176 he implied he had a weapon in the note but none was seen
2163177 i am looking forward to seeing brett favre in a new york jets uniform
2163178 the sheriff has to run the jail in an orderly fashion if every judge starts ordering as many hours as a defendants requests its going to be problematic
2163179 i thought you know i love the 50s everything people did it was new it just seemed like such an innovative time
2163180 this is a whole new batch of kids who havent experienced the 50s
2163181 this is the first big musical ive done with them every day i learn something new from them
2163182 ive taken several of their ideas and put them into the show i encourage their ideas one of the things i love i can act goofy with them and get them to laugh and they make me laugh as well
2163183 dont worry about a thing cause every little thing gonna be all right
2163184 the community really opens its arms to having athletes there which is nice
2163185 its an exciting event just to see people of all ages competing in the triathlon out there biking and swimming for a couple hours
2163186 it just gives athletes of all abilities a chance to participate in this type of race
2163187 it brings with it a little more drama that way theres a little more heart to this than the movie
2163188 i fell in love with the music before ever seeing the show
2163189 he was crazy and wild he was always getting drunk and getting into trouble
2163190 its easy to play a drunk its hard to play the emotional scenes when swann is not drunk
2163191 its fun you get to play with it and have a good time you need to have all your lines down cold

2163196 our ponies were running every which way in the pouring rain but none of them got hurt thank goodness for that
2163197 but in massive power outages like these the last ones without power are always the hardest ones to restore
2163198 we shot over 250 photos to make sure everything was documented
2163199 from what we can determine the tornado hit the front of the dome and actually lifted the front of the dome at the base
2163200 and the rest kind of deflated from there the staff were huddled on site by the driving range and they could hear the trees coming and the dome ripping
2163201 our main focus is working overtime to pick up debris
2163202 thats probably going to be consuming public works for the next few weeks
2163203 1984 is or is not relevant today you should build on the comments before yours but always use good ettiquette
2163204 we used to sing acapella music but we decided to blend our music with instruments and we didnt know how to operate the instruments and thats were we decided to approach baba manyeruke to teach us how to come up with a good album
2163205 we used to travel from mazowe to chitungwiza to have our practice with baba manyeruke at first we were afraid to approach him but we realised he was a down to earth man who was willing to assist us
2163206 recent factory job layoff announcements are starting to trickle into the data as weakness in manufacturing output hits the personnel ranks in the associated transportation and warehousing and wholesale trade sectors

2163213 the result of these cumulative efforts to investigate the cell to investigate life at the molecular level is a loud clear piercing cry of design
2163214 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
2163215 this is what the true god jehovah has said the creator of the heavens the one laying out the earth and its produce the one giving breath to the people on it
2163216 jehovah jehovah a god merciful and gracious slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness and truth preserving loving kindness for thousands pardoning error and transgression and sin

2163219 he will wipe out every tear from their eyes and death will be no more neither will mourning nor outcry nor pain be anymore the former things have passed away

2163253 im ceo of a growing booming company that is hiring and training new employees at a very rapid rate
2163254 i need to be focused on that right now because the demands of the job are only going to go up from here
2163255 it is pure coincidence but the timing of my departure couldnt be better
2163256 this will give someone an opportunity to experience almost a complete school year cycle before deciding whether they want to continue on and run for the seat in april talk about on the job training
2163257 bruce is a numbers driven guy and we benefited from that as a district
2163258 bruce brought a lot of interesting leadership qualities to the table every monday and those will be missed
2163259 i couldnt be happier to be on the team that addressed the space concerns and got metea valley high school going
2163260 this district had incredible space challenges taking our youngsters out of an overcrowded environment is going to benefit every last one of them in some way and im glad to be a part of that
2163261 get back to what a school board should be doing
2163262 this is the time for them to get back to focusing on the classroom and children
2163263 with everything settled with metea and all day kindergarten there should be nothing to distract them from that this year
2163264 im confident we will pick someone who has a passion for education and a passion for indian prairie
2163265 no we didnt have a van thats why we laughed the next day when we found out that they were saying it was a van
2163266 mr sarno says mr sarno mr salerno thats a slip there
2163267 i have not heard one bit of evidence that someone gave an order from the chicago outfit
2163268 3 albums by female rappers that were pushed back further than tyra banks hairline
2163269 lets take an extremely mediocre rapper and market him as the best and see how many idiots buy the hype
2163270 ok im going to list all the rap artists you should listen to in order to uneducate yourself
2163271 at least metal artists are not posers who who record themselves talking about how much money they have over a sound track that someone else probably created
2163272 some metal bands purposely stop making music videos just to avoid mtv
2163273 next big rapper was just a clone of the last big rapper
2163274 i am not sure where you got the idea that metal is about suicide im assuming you are referring to bands like korn puddle of mud papa roach type music i agree that they mostly suck
2163275 the reason i came here was actually to find decent rap artists
2163276 dont worry people in a couple years hip hop should be long dead and forgotten
2163277 everyone who likes pink is gay but blue rocks dude
2163278 you sir are the pinnacle of degradation in our society
2163279 your posts fail in a way that can only be described as epic
2163280 you call out metal as being focused on suicide and other garbage which is pretty laughable
2163281 face it this genre is something that will pass and fade away in time as it has no cultural value
2163282 seeing how you have taken the role of rap fan spokesperson enlighten us with an epic rap hip hop track album or artist
2163283 im angry at government the police other black people white people anyone who doesnt respect me etc
2163284 i criticized the genre itself for being a bunch of monotonous uncreative garbage by uncreative hacks raping hiphop and their fans for all they can
2163285 rap and country are sort of hard to prevent stereotyping tho as the songs in those genres all sound alike
2163286 so what exactly are you arguing here attacking rock and myself for what
2163287 their first album and last album sound absolutely nothing alike same band completely different sound
2163288 for most of the planned residents they probably didnt have a greenhouse on their own how wonderful would that be
2163289 somebody with money doesnt want to live with somebody without

2163308 while texans for lawsuit reform claims to be a grassroots organization with over 15 000 members their campaign finance reports show them to be nothing more than a front group for a small group of wealthy businessmen
2163309 while there is nothing wrong with businesses or individuals promoting their personal agendas before the state legislature they should do so honestly
2163310 tlrs policy agenda which includes taking away the right of texans to elect their judges and protecting negligent liquor store owners from being held accountable when they serve intoxicated customers is not reflective of the views of ordinary citizens we urge texans for lawsuit reform to end their fraudulent claims of being a grassroots organization and to stop lying to texas voters about who they really represent

2163420 its a huge relief for sure its nice to contribute i dont want to feel like dead weight on the team you know it gives you a little bit of self worth i guess
2163421 i was a little concerned when i was walking to the dugout to be honest with you i dont know how i got there
2163422 smoggy as hell giving way to just plain smoggy and with luck there could be a shower heavy enough to scrub a few thousand tons of carbon based particulates from the air
2163423 if were serious about making the world a better place we must figure out how to change these patterns
2163424 we are better informed with more objective knowledge about whats really happening in our lives
2163425 the tone is very casual as opposed to the formality of
2163426 its better to be ahead than behind and looking up
2163427 we just have to have a better record than them after 162 games
2163428 it doesnt matter who youre playing if theyre in the way weve got to beat them if theyre not in the way weve got to beat the team thats in front of us and not worry about them the best record is going to get you to the playoffs regardless of who you beat
2163429 were really going to have to step it up a notch
2163430 they are in our division and because theyre the ones nipping at our heels as it goes on though we do play a lot of games against other teams and i think thats when weve really been able to go out there and win i think if you can get away with it its great
2163431 but when it really comes down to it in september were really going to have to win those games against the division rivals
2163432 its not like were not going up there and trying

2163435 even many people who are not christians believe that he was a great and wise teacher he was certainly one of the most influential people who ever lived
2163436 that a few simple men should in one generation have invented so powerful and appealing a personality so lofty an ethic and so inspiring a vision of human brotherhood would be a miracle far more incredible than any recorded in the gospels
2163437 all things therefore that you want men to do to you you also must likewise do to them
2163438 continue to love your enemies and to pray for those persecuting you
2163439 when we shall get together on the teachings laid down by christ in this sermon on the mount we shall have solved the problems of the whole world

2163443 she wasnt trying to give her momma a heart attack
2163444 my reasons for leaving are justified i felt like i was never taken seriously as a musician with the guys from trouble but i did the best i could in that 28 year effort with the band that is all i would like to say for now however this is not a retirement from the music industry for i have my band retro grave with the full length coming out in a few months with fine players the ep was a solo effort
2163445 the third one was ok but i prefer the first one because no third movie is better than the first
2163446 it was a great movie granted it was not better than the first one because no sequel is better than the original movie i just wish it was much longer
2163447 this program seeks a much more early and active intervention in the foreclosure process to increase the probability that residents can keep their homes
2163448 we already have working groups in place for all subprime foreclosures in the county
2163449 queens county is the epicenter for the mortgage foreclosure crisis in new york state

2163451 we welcome any initiative to try and help to decrease the problem

2163457 two different items which are essential to anybody calling himself a christian
2163458 that everything we see in this world has a cause and as you go back in the chain of causes further and further you must come to a first cause and to that first cause you give the name of god
2163459 it may just as well be the world as god
2163460 you are working really hard running like that i dont know how old i am but i must be at least 10 times older than you and ive never run like that
2163461 before you put your baby in a bike trailer she must be able to sit up steadily and she needs to have a helmet that fits properly
2163462 i would be happier if only i could change this
2163463 my life would be complete if i just had this
2163464 this would be perfect if i could make it like this
2163465 oh thats fine but it would be much better if i could do this
2163466 you are going to be 24 that is so old

2163476 theres a lot of baseball left to be played this year and thats what i need to remain focused on i have to get through this year healthy but if i do that i have all intentions of playing next year
2163477 its usually one of the first things that goes through my mind
2163478 youre taking him away from the people who could help him thats not something were comfortable with right now
2163479 the team is doing great things i just want to stay out of the way believe it or not i can stay out of the way
2163480 i hope this is the last change well make for a long time
2163481 it wasnt that weird because id never done it before
2163482 hes like the pudgy guy who shows up at the company picnic everybody is laughing and then he walks away with all the trophies
2163483 its just real old and they havent kept it up ive heard stories about former mets manager art howe coming off a road trip and finding a rat a live rodent on his desk i remember us trying to catch a rat running around in the bullpen
2163484 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that
2163485 but were not optimistic that were going to have him any time soon
2163486 we feel he is healthy and liked the fact that he has experience and has had success in the past
2163487 weve been looking for a lefthander for a long time and we think this lefthander can help us
2163488 its going to take some time still backs are tricky

2163520 of course they can the ten commandments are a very good adjunct to common sense behavior if one is to live in a large diverse society dont kill anyone or steal from them keep your hands off their spouse always try and tell the truth be good to your parents these things can be ordered as a result of basic human decency perhaps even instinct if the evolutionary biologists like dawkins keep digging and not necessarily because disobeying these strictures could land the transgressor in a very bad place after they die

2163534 you want him to be 20 0 but theres nothing that we can do its definitely frustrating sometimes not being able to hit behind him but its part of the game its not like were going out there not trying to hit and not trying to score runs it just happens to be working out that way right now
2163535 going out there i think with whats occurred i tend to put a little more pressure on myself just knowing that every run i give up really does mean something
2163536 you just have to minimize the damage there have been times when i havent been able to and there have been times i have unfortunately i guess it hasnt showed much where it really counts in wins and losses
2163537 you just have to hit when it counts and thats when you have a runner on
2163538 thats where you have to improve dont get me wrong you have to hit to get on but you definitely have to be a much better hitter with runners on in order to be a good offensive team anaheim for example nobody is having career years but they get runners on and they just rake thats where they do their damage with runners on
2163539 were inconsistent but at the same time were still in first place
2163540 and to me were still two games ahead in the loss column and thats what counts what can we do about it we come out tomorrow and win tomorrows game
2163541 i was frustrated about not having a singer so i went on youtube for a couple of days and just sat on it for hours i was starting to think i was never going to find anybody but then i found the zoo and i watched a bunch of different video clips that they had posted after watching the videos over and over again i had to walk away from the computer and let what i heard sink in because it sounded too good to be true i thought he cant be that good but he is that good hes the real deal and so tremendously talented arnel doesnt sound synthetic and hes not emulating anyone i tried to get a hold of him through youtube and i finally heard from him that night but it took some convincing to get him to believe that it really was me and not an imposter
2163542 i want to say very clearly that im not on the markeet and that its my desire to continue at liverpool
2163543 villa admitted he would be tempted by the prospect of playing with torres on a weekly basis
2163544 liverpool also have a spanish coach and i also have a lot of friends there
2163545 obrigado grande deus por me dar tudo de que eu preciso e me fazer t o feliz
2163546 in the world of fireworks the worst thing you can have is a drought
2163547 although theres a thing as too much rain in the world of fireworks it has worked in our favor
2163548 youve got to have the rain to make the grass grow but then youve got to have the sun and the dry weather to dry it
2163549 its supposed to be a lot warmer this time of year and a lot sunnier
2163550 it does put a damper on things people dont want to go out in the rain its definitely slowing the summer events down a lot
2163551 its just because everythings wet thats been the biggest hindrance
2163552 overall i think people go when they can and i still see our numbers being pretty consistent
2163553 people arent canceling because the weather is so unpredictable we dont think people are changing their plans they might rearrange them in some part
2163554 for example looking at yesterday and today basically the same movies throughout the day we did 500 people in the morning yesterday and we did only 250 today
2163555 its normal if its raining out people like to go to the movies
2163556 theres definitely a wave of people who are staying at home rather than going on vacation there are more people going to these events
2163557 its all about having people there to watch the fireworks display
2163558 obviously if its really wet day people are not going out
2163559 after nine years of managing in triple a im in the best situation ive ever been in
2163560 a gorgeous ballpark tremendous owners gorgeous city 1 3 million population
2163561 how many people can say they go to work every day and love what they do i dont regret the number of years ive spent in independent ball ive had success
2163562 you better be good at something because there arent many jobs out there nottle said
2163563 theres a lot more reporters than there are managers if there were only 100 jobs in the nation and you wanted to be a writer youd take the worst one wouldnt you this is the only thing ive ever done or ever wanted to do
2163564 one of the first guys i got was ed nottle
2163565 a triple a manager of the year and i said why do you want to come to a league that doesnt exist its baseball and they dont leave how many managers have quit and said theyve had enough of independent baseball they all come back i think they validate the product these good people would not be here if it was bush or there werent good players
2163566 we produce our own the guys who grew up in independent baseball are managing the quality were getting is remarkable these are pros they respect the players they respect the game the bad actors dont stay around long
2163567 i love the fact i dont have to talk to some farm director who has never played ball in his life and i have to talk to him every night
2163568 i dont know what you writers think of independent ball
2163569 but anybody who gets drafted and goes into a ball is going into a helluva lot easier league than this is period
2163570 i knew it was going to be fun it was pro ball twice as good as half the parks in double a
2163571 but i think its tougher than affiliates everybodys been released including you
2163572 its as if he managed eight years in double a ball
2163573 because everybodys released you have to completely turn everybodys frame of mind around you have to work harder as a manager in independent ball we cant hit we cant field our job is to create an atmosphere to give you everything theyve got
2163574 and if they dont i dont have to talk to anybody including my owner theyre on a plane and im getting a new player this and the big leagues people dont realize are the only two leagues in the world that are strictly to win no player development here
2163575 but once i got into it i really liked doing it managing the team putting players in trying to get them to play better the kids give you 100 percent effort and thats one thing i like about independent baseball
2163576 im glad a lot of the old players are starting to get back involved
2163577 theres one thing being an ex player you can tell them about your experiences not just at the ballpark but also off the field its a learning experience both ways for these kids
2163578 in the last couple of years a lot of guys have come to realize independent baseball isnt a bad place to be
2163579 you really have total control of what youre doing you dont have to deal with the paperwork every day that you do with affiliated ball
2163580 a lot of former players are coming back and managing these teams independent league baseball is getting the cream of the crop
2163581 theres no other place to manage and get paid i know ive got some really good friends in this league i guarantee you geddy worcesters gedman would take a double a job right now if it were offered hed be crazy not to
2163582 its something i think about a little bit more now than i did four years ago he said
2163583 i think being with an affiliated organization you always have the opportunity to move up im not saying it couldnt happen from an independent job but in an organization affiliated ball its who you know
2163584 id rather stay in the independent game if i had to do that
2163585 some of the head people in these organizations are some people ive been with in the past i talked to former major league hitting great rod carew the other day and hes adamant about me getting back to the big leagues as an instructor or as a coach or a manager
2163586 being around them you can learn so much by just observing
2163587 but not only do i deserve an opportunity to be in the big leagues i dont want you to just give it to me i want to earn it one thing i know i can do is i can teach hitting thats probably going to be my first step into the big leagues theyre going to start me off theyre not just going to give me a managers job theyre going to make me work for it all it is is getting an opportunity to get in
2163588 i wont name em but i hate em i hate the fact independent teams hire some local college or high school coach when theres 20 guys who have put 15 20 years of life in the game and dont have a job its a pro game i guarantee you
2163589 i dont say they cant get further up but theyre not going to start off in triple a ill tell you that
2163590 because ownership wont allow it theres a stigma of independent ball and there always will be
2163591 i love the fact i can spend eight nine months a year in a town and build up crowds
2163592 its part of my job maybe other managers like to be home more than i do it depends on the manager most managers put four months a year in a town
2163593 its just a part of the game now that its in my blood
2163594 ive got to do it its just a game man this is what weve done our whole lives
2163595 its just what we do baseball is what we do and its what we know
2163596 on balance i think the auctions were received better than expected
2163597 the market is reacting to the weak equity market and above all the retail news
2163598 thats why the market is higher despite the anticipation of the long bond auction
2163599 before the auction the market always reacts to the state of the economy and inflation
2163600 with inflation remaining high and the economy in a slump thats why bonds sold off earlier

2163610 if you want to die so badly go on kill yourself
2163611 why theres no reason just be mature about it and prepare your speech by monday ill expect you there
2163612 death does not concern us because as long as we exist death is not here and when it does come we no longer exist
2163613 but does death not rebute everything a person may have stood for in life
2163614 can there be a meaning in life therefore if death erases and seemingly contradicts life and any meaning that a human being could have created

2163618 edwards made a point of telling abcs bob woodruff that his wifes cancer was in remission when he began the affair with hunter
2163619 these snails have an operculum a door that closes the shell
2163620 they can be out of the water for longer than other snails and when fed to fish they are not digested and sometimes come out alive this has a potential to alter the salmon and trout fisheries because they alter the food chain
2163621 in the western u s this species is of special concern largely because of their ability to modify ecosystems
2163622 in our most recent survey we were lucky if we found a few hundred per square meter
2163623 in lake erie they are not very abundant but it is unclear what they are doing 100 feet below the surface
2163624 the first is that any introduction of a nonnative species can cause worse problems than they were expected to cure the second is that these flukes have a multiple host life cycle infecting ducks that are apparently not affected before infecting the snails this might work in the west where the snails are in shallow water but no duck is going to dive 100 feet to get snails
2163625 that means that recreational water users must be very careful moving from one place to another we advise anglers to freeze waders and fishing gear or use formula 409 or something like that to kill the snails
2163626 one thing i try to do is to keep it even keel good or bad
2163627 hes 21 years old and he pitched like a guy whos been around 10 12 years
2163628 he had some big outs he had to get against good hitters and he didnt get spooked
2163629 sometimes it puts pressure on me sometimes you get wins with your eyes closed and sometimes there are games like this
2163630 some days we score a lot of runs some days not
2163631 were definitely not going out there trying to lose or trying not to hit

2163648 people will be able to get a sense of before and after
2163649 for example people are talking about how selective logging is an appropriate way of not harming the environment
2163650 but we have evidence that from the sound perspective selective logging has a profound effect on the natural world the pictures of before and after look exactly the same but the sound is completely different
2163651 our u s momentum and value model identifies industry value traps as industries that appear significantly undervalued relative to their historical multiple but have deteriorating price and earnings momentum

2163661 i think our radios and televisions are still stuck in one track music that is kind of babyish cerelac stuff many of them do not play main stream music that is why you hardly hear music from herbert kinobe and youssou ndour so how then will they play kerunens music

2163667 almost two weeks ago txir released an eye opening report taking a closer look at tlrs legislative activities this generated an overwhelming response from grassroots activists who had no idea what tlr actually lobbied for and previously believed that tlr was committed to advancing ideologically conservative principles
2163668 since tlr is unwilling to post information on their website regarding their belief that texan voters are not capable of electing good judges we have decided to post their own materials on judicial selection unedited on our website
2163669 we hope by making this information readily available to the public texas voters will take a closer look at tlrs true motives and special interest agenda

2163679 the granting of an injunction to restrain the defendants conduct abroad is not futile if the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction and his assets are within the jurisdiction
2163680 the presence of assets in the jurisdiction means that if the injunction is not complied with by the defendant it will be open to the plaintiff to seek an order for their seizure

2163729 we wanted a week of peace and quiet and hiking with the kids so i googled sequoia cabins and then this house popped up that looked fantastic with close proximity to a river in fact you can hear the river from the house
2163730 since the trip we have decided to spend one week each month not using electronic devices
2163731 it will be our attempt to relive the vibe from kaweah

2163744 of the 21 people on the grid at that hockenheim f2 race i did three were dead within three months
2163745 drivers who were in formula one five years or longer had a chance of 66 to crash fatally i once calculated this with my wife helen during my active years i lost 75 people in racing
2163746 i wasnt a member of the stewart fanclub i found him a pain in the arse in hindsight he was right he had to race and had to ensure that he would survive to tell the tale
2163747 i dont think so he felt that a lot had still to be done
2163748 it all happened so fast i turned into woodcote saw all the dust flying about and got on brakes but everything was cold because it was only the first lap all the drivers were just glad there was no fire because we all had full tanks of course
2163749 tunnel oost is a very nice turn it is a real turn it is a difficult turn tunnel oost was a matter of centimeters a bit like blanchimont at spa or the 130r at suzuka the car needs to be neutral it all listens very closely at 260 270 kilometers per hour
2163750 i just couldnt turn it over i could see he was alive and i could hear him shouting but i couldnt get the car over i was trying to get people to help me and if i could have turned the car over he would have been alright we could have got him out
2163751 a lap or two more and the overturned car which by now i had identified as roger williamsons march was well ablaze and i did wonder why the big fire engine parked just up the road at the next corner was not being brought into action or why there was not a lot of marshal activity had things been really serious there would have been a red flag wouldnt there
2163752 accident driver ok he is standing next to his car
2163753 all the organisers did for roger was to get the car back to the garage then come to ask if a couple of us would go down and get the cadaver out that was their only real concern

2163756 civil rights can we get enough momentum to get over the next hill
2163757 some of these singers settled in the music street of peshawar at dabgari but after the establishment of the religious government in the province their houses and offices were attacked by the workers of certain religious groups and they were forced to leave the place this caused huge financial and emotional loss to the helpless afghan artists
2163758 excluding very few singers who managed to settle somewhere in europe and america the majority of the afghan singers have reached the verge of starvation they find little opportunity to demonstrate their artistic skills and get payment for their work they are living in small rented houses and their children are growing without education and health facilities
2163759 no one knows that a great afghan rabab maestro lal jan lives a life of poverty and helplessness here the 70 year old master musician lal jan contributed a number of new compositions and tunes to the pashto and dari musical heritage he is now living here on 100 pakistani rupees per day
2163760 the musical instruments which they destroyed were our whole property in this world this incident affected us very badly i am sick and suffering from high blood pressure and kidney stones
2163761 i have composed innumerable songs i can sing both in pashto and dari languages and i have full command of the rabab and the harmonium my wife died 30 years ago and i have no children my brother who is also a master of tabla drums is my only friend in this world we live here in this small room now we are old and find little opportunities to earn our bread
2163762 we get no chance on pakistan television and radio because we are refugees usually we go on music ceremonies in pakistan we get some chances during the winter season to perform at marriage functions while in the summer we go to kabul this continuous displacement and traveling leaves us with little time to concentrate on the health and education of our children
2163763 to be honest i feel i am pakistani because i lived my life here i know nothing about my home and village in afghanistan my father is in canada in the current situation of continuous war and instability in afghanistan i cant live with my wife and children there here in pakistan they say that i am an afghan refugee and i have to leave one day tell me where will i go believe me i dont understand this situation
2163764 in this case the learned primary judge did not avert to the possibility that any adverse effect of pretrial publicity might be dissipated by an adjournment of the trial for a few months
2163765 this possibility should have been considered to fail to address this consideration was an error
2163766 the system of trial by jury proceeds on the assumption that jurors can be trusted to be true to their oath
2163767 where there has been extensive pretrial publicity it is customary for the trial judge to explain the obvious points of distinction between media reports and the evidence presented in criminal cases
2163768 there have been numerous reports of sightings across the metropolitan area they have been checked out and found not to be him
2163769 i would argue there is a need for higher superannuation contributions
2163770 as a general comment i would agree that low middle earners would need a higher level of superannuation contribution above the 9 per cent
2163771 in terms of equity it is unfair that lower income earners are effectively taxed on a higher rate on their super contributions than their marginal income
2163772 just so grateful theyve been able to find him and that hes well
2163773 from the beginning of the investigation there were five options and we had to go through all those options
2163774 we are still investigating but it would appear that he wasnt missing or ran away he was actually being hidden
2163775 it would appear that he was there of his own free will and he knew that person he was staying with
2163776 the secret to higher sat scores lies in practice and preparation this test was actually designed to reward hard working students with better scores sat prep books and materials are more accessible than ever but the real challenges are finding the motivation to practice long and hard enough and managing study time so that grades and other scholastic pursuits dont suffer with over nine years of tutoring experience i can help anybody simplify their sat prep unlike a tutoring agency i personally instruct every student taking into consideration each ones strengths and weaknesses score goals as well as scheduling needs each test prep regimen is customized to deliver the highest possible score gains i guarantee results to any student whos committed to score improvement simply put i offer the highest level of test prep instruction and expertise available my instruction not only boosts scores it helps students gain confidence and perform better throughout their academic careers

2163786 but the real signal came out with some of the northerly species that are more common in canada and the northern part of the u s their southern range boundaries are actually moving northward as well at a much faster clip
2163787 there are a wide spectrum of changes that are occurring and those changes are occurring in a relatively short amount of time were not talking centuries were talking decades
2163788 new york citizens need to recognize that these changes are occurring
2163789 whether they are good or bad whether they should be addressed whether we should adapt to them whether we should try to mitigate some of this those are questions that really rightfully belong in the political arena
2163790 what you begin to see is a systematic pattern of these species moving northward as we would predict with regional warming
2163791 its helping us meet the increasing need for our lab services
2163792 in addition to our clinical work for geisinger we also conduct specialty microbiology testing for regional clients
2163793 so we have an incredible amount of specimens that are handled in our lab
2163794 this is a breakthrough in microbiology a field that hasnt benefited from the types of automation that are common in other labs
2163795 with this advanced technology the wasp complements the outstanding work of our lab technicians
2163796 regulators will have new tools to control the marketing and content of a deadly and addictive product
2163797 these advertisements triggered the anti smoking messages which were having a devastating effect on cigarette consumption
2163798 for every dollar they spent to advance their product they forced the airing of more anti smoking advertisements and hence lost more customers
2163799 at the time the suggestion of voluntary withdrawal of cigarette advertising by the companies was taken by some as a long delayed demonstration of industry altruism
2163800 was that as both the cigarette advertisements and most anti smoking messages left the air
2163801 the theory of free speech is grounded on the belief that people will make the right choice if presented with all points of view on a controversial issue

2163803 we were surprised by the fact that in some cases bugs may be unable to survive in shallow water but we did discover they can safely dive as deep as 30 metres
2163804 we will also better understand the processes of cognitive impairment the declines that may predict eventual alzheimers disease or other dementias
2163805 through participation in this study we can also contribute to the larger understanding of how peoples mental abilities change over the years
2163806 by following individual people over time we will gain insight to changes in cognition and possibly discover ways to alleviate or slow the rate of decline
2163807 we will also better understand the processes of cognitive impairment the declines that may predict eventual alzheimers disease or other dementias
2163808 people in their 60s and beyond often have a more positive outlook than people in their 20s and 30s we get better at regulating our emotions and at emphasizing what we can do rather than our deficiencies we often become more content
2163809 the outward signs of arousal in many women that seems to have little effect on a womans willingness or desire to have sex
2163810 this seminar will provide an ideal venue for interaction between students industrialists engineers scientists and clinical investigators conducting research relevant to nanotechnology and the life sciences the workshop would be specially attractive to beginners research investigators and students who want to learn the theoretical developments hands on practical experience in the formulation characterization and evaluation of nano particles and about the latest funding opportunities relevant to nano science and nano technology
2163811 the unique nanotechnology represents not just one specific area but a vast variety of disciplines ranging from basic material science to personal care applications

2163816 the jonesboro regional chamber of commerce power breakfast highlighting asu athletics was the best attended of the year
2163817 coaches steve roberts of football tommy raffo of baseball and john brady of mens basketball spoke to an enthusiastic crowd about the upcoming sports seasons
2163818 i was pleased with todays practice the young guys especially
2163819 their execution was a whole lot better than it was yesterday and i was proud of the way they focused now we need to keep that focus and speed them up
2163820 the older guys came out and i thought we had a pretty good practice offensively we did some good things and the enthusiasm remained high from last night defensively we made a few mistakes but im real confident in the way they are working that were going to be a good defensive team
2163821 tomorrow well go to full pads well have a short practice prior to our scrimmage and things have to change im pleased with what our players are doing out here but anytime we go live its time to take it to another level and im expecting to see that tomorrow afternoon
2163822 allen muse our freshman wide receiver from leesville la has been diagnosed with a heart condition and is not cleared by our team doctors
2163823 it is a credit to our team doctors and asu head certified athletic trainer ron carroll for all they do to ensure the health of our young men that play he muse has a serious condition and after consulting with some more doctors he will have to have surgery and will not be joining our football team for at least this fall

2163835 baby boomers who were raised with misconceptions about the disease may be at risk
2163836 in this day and age i still get patients who believe that they developed diabetes from eating too much sugar
2163837 bad eating habits such as too much refined sugars empty carbohydrates and fructose does not cause diabetes
2163838 baby boomers who were raised with misconceptions about the disease may be at risk
2163839 the better the patient controls his or her blood sugar the less likely the more serious complications associated with diabetes will progress anyone already experiencing the side effects of diabetes needs to achieve and maintain the most stringent possible control in order to minimize their further progression
2163840 type 2 diabetes even pre diabetes is serious even if your blood sugar isnt that high
2163841 keep in mind you can have your cake and eat it too but if you want to eat something rich in carbs you will need to balance it out by cutting an equivalent amount of carbs or sugar from somewhere else in your diet
2163842 patients have a good deal more flexibility in their diets than they might suspect the rest is just a matter of care and moderation
2163843 this myth is dangerous because you can wind up in the hospital if you ignore symptoms of hyperglycemia which is hard to detect by the way you feel
2163844 making do without a regular blood glucose tests is like flying without a parachute or crossing the street with your eyes closed youre guessing learn your bodys signals when you get into trouble but be certain to use your glucose monitor to be sure
2163845 i still get patients who believe their lives are over once complications set it
2163846 the reality is that with the development of proper skills and mindset and the possession of monitoring equipment patients with diabetes can continue to live full lives even with severe complications many diabetics even insulin dependent live well into old age
2163847 pay attention to your body keep ahead of what your diabetes is doing for baby boomers this is no time for surprises consult with your doctor or your diabetes educator discuss exercise plans and any adjustment in medications with your doctor first
2163848 when you are 50 you may injure your body more easily than when you were 20
2163849 joints tissues and muscles may not be as flexible as they used to be so as you get older you need to take extra steps to protect yourself from injuries when you exercise

2163853 im really looking forward to starting filming and i think viewers can expect some interesting encounters as we explore the relationship between danielle and eli
2163854 i cant wait to spend some time in leeds and meet the rest of the cast
2163855 im so pleased to welcome an actress with nicolas calibre to the show
2163856 eli likes to manipulate people but danielle is a different proposition and shell definitely get under his skin
2163857 this is a very complex issue and our understanding of it continues to grow
2163858 both dental and medical professionals need to maintain open lines of communication with each other to ensure the best care for their patients who are taking bisphosphonates
2163859 if a patient needs dental surgery the dentist and treating physicians need to decide whether other treatment options including systemic antibiotics or antimicrobial mouth rinses can help reduce the risk of osteonecrosis
2163860 the soap as the viewing public know it will be changed to become more of a weekly drama
2163861 the suggestion is that very little will refer back to earlier storylines
2163862 after nearly five years of wearing matthews suits every morning and having to shave every day i feel ready to pull on some bermuda shorts and grow a goatee
2163863 but ive had a brilliant time at emmerdale and im excited about what lies ahead
2163864 joint replacements used to be limited to the elderly but not anymore
2163865 the bottom line is boomers are more active and were seeing more of these high impact injuries that are otherwise more common in a younger population
2163866 it was very uncommon to see so many people become avid runners into their 60s and 70s a generation ago
2163867 but its very common now to have middle aged people take up such a high endurance sport and run at a much later age
2163868 many workers approaching traditional retirement ages say they want to keep working but its not yet clear how many will be able to keep their jobs or find new ones
2163869 employers seem to value older workers for their maturity experience and work ethic but worry about out of date skills and the high cost of employing them
2163870 the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles

2163873 we want to create a new farming dynasty families and farming are the cornerstone of emmerdale and its important we dont forget that
2163874 we want to take the show back to its farming roots while keeping it sexy and exciting
2163875 those who stand in the middle of the road get run over
2163876 if youre 20 and not a liberal you have no heart but if youre not a conservative by the time youre 40 you have no brain
2163877 kroto tested these inorganic fullerenes and found that they could withstand greater impacts than their carbon counterparts and this led to the idea of using them for bulletproof vests bike helmets and armored vehicles
2163878 we realized that by adding these inorganic fullerenes to lubricants like oil and grease we could increase the efficiency and thereby lessen the resistance and save energy
2163879 apnano materials nanoparticles are excellent optical absorbing materials and among the best substances absorbing light in the visible and near infrared wavelengths

2163895 we have had a few confirmed cases of measles this year but not a lot however the problem is the take up it is on par with the national level of 85 but it is too low
2163896 we need to raise the level to 90 95 to stop outbreaks were just waiting for things to become worse as children get older they will go to school and be in closer proximity with one another and more outbreaks will happen
2163897 my advice is for children to be vaccinated against measles measles is a serious illness that has the potential to kill children
2163898 concerns previously raised about the mmr vaccination have now been discredited we would urge all parents who have not had their child or children vaccinated to do so now

2163901 tameer is eager to open new horizons of investments by developing distinguished real estate projects we give top priority to completing and delivering projects on time and we are committed to adopt the best standards in design and building
2163902 this has been the motivating factor for two real estate giants to sign a joint venture mou today to develop two magnificent projects the abu dhabi towers and the gate district at shams abu dhabi both of these projects will have a high level of creativity in design and construction standards we will invest whatever expertise we have in these projects and they will remain major landmarks for years to come

2163905 on 86th street and while the intent was not to obscure or enhance an advertisement it sort of functions as a billboard in and of itself no
2163906 as far as i know we were the only street in essex which had the lights turned back on
2163907 the street was in total darkness and it was very scary for people coming home in the early hours of the morning
2163908 we are the main route through from the high street where the pubs are and there was a lot of damage to property and urinating in peoples front gardens and things like that
2163909 we were exceedingly grateful when the lights went back on
2163910 we understand that the county council will soon be reviewing the outcome of this pilot scheme and undoubtedly will take into account the views expressed by the public along the way
2163911 we will be interested to learn of the conclusions reached and the county councils proposed decision on this
2163912 we are best at discriminating the facial features that are typical of our neighbors and if they happen to be parrots we become very good at recognizing individual birds
2163913 ultimately we are interested in what happens in a natural environment
2163914 but some questions require more control over the properties of visual stimuli than a picture of a natural scene would allow
2163915 the response of individual neurons can be strongly influenced by simple stimuli in the surround of the receptive field a phenomenon known as contextual modulation
2163916 context is an important part of how we perceive visual stimuli
2163917 and these results show how individual neurons might adjust their properties in different natural environments such as on a beach or in a forest
2163918 the perseid meteors are the debris of a comet that is now far away from the sun where it spends most of its life in the coldness of space however during the perseid shower the earth passes through the trail of dust debris that the comet left behind many years ago
2163919 when one of these dust particles is intercepted by our planet as it orbits the sun it causes the dust particle to completely burn up leaving an eye catching streak of light
2163920 perseid meteors appear to originate from the direction of the constellation perseus which rises in the northeast the best view is in this direction and far away from city lights onlookers should find a safe dark site such as a city or state park where oncoming vehicle headlights wont interfere
2163921 it appears that for people who have a certain genetic makeup the initial physical reaction to smoking can play a significant role in determining what happens next
2163922 if cigarette smoking is sustained nicotine addiction can occur in a few days to a few months
2163923 the finding of a genetic association with pleasurable early smoking experiences may help explain how people get addicted and of course once addicted many will keep smoking for the rest of their lives
2163924 understanding the genetics of complex disorders such as nicotine addiction will require much more research on key traits
2163925 analysis of iraqi market suitability for individual home water purifiers
2163926 with so many gastro intestinal diseases and health related issues here in iraq and poor water quality being the prime reason i thought what better way to bring this issue to the front than to talk about it
2163927 the army gives us such a great opportunity to continue an education and with new improvements to the montgomery g i bill a soldier would have to be insane not to take advantage of it and get something better out of their military career
2163928 this degree from cmu is just one of many goals that i have written on a tattered sheet of paper thats over 10 years old now and it keeps me focused and on track for the future
2163929 a ph d is the next educational goal on my list
2163930 we have the physical system were taking flow measurements of actual swimmers and were getting more information than anyone has ever had before about swimming and how the swimmer interacts with the water and so far these techniques have contributed to some very significant improvements in the lap times of olympic swimmers
2163931 this project moved the swimming world beyond the observational into scientific fact
2163932 the knowledge gained gave me the foundation for which every technical stroke change in preparation for the beijing olympics was based
2163933 to see how a swimmers motion affects the flow you need to know how much force the swimmer is producing and how that force impacts the water
2163934 swimming research has strived to understand water flow around a swimmer for decades because how a swimmers body moves the surrounding water is everything
2163935 the ability to measure flow and forces in a natural and unimpeded environment hasnt been available until recently and dr weis technology and methods presented usa swimming with a unique opportunity that united states swimmers and coaches could learn a lot from
2163936 how often does a researcher get to do something like this
2163937 its been a journey into a world that someone like me would have never before gotten the privilege to see first hand
2163938 its everyones dream to make a difference and im excited to keep helping the team for as long as they need me
2163939 estamos prontos e confiantes para fazer um bom trabalho em casa e conquistar o resultado positivo realizamos uma pr temporada bem produtiva e recebemos alguns refor os o campeonato deve ser equilibrado e queremos fazer uma temporada ainda melhor que a ltima

2163967 we do not have a national pricing policy and some prices are set locally and we try to be as competitive as we can

2163969 why dont you begin with a blog and then see if you can make it bigger
2163970 a device the size of a sugar cube will be able to record and store high resolution video footage of every second of a human life within two decades experts say a nice way to chronicle your life or a step towards the nanny state
2163971 imagine having a personal companion that whines at you three times a day telling you that you are eating the wrong things and that you spent more than you earned today the scary thing is it might be foisted on us
2163972 like the fake grass for which the practice is named such astroturf messages look as though they come from the grass roots but are ersatz
2163973 while the high price of gasoline is the major issue on the minds of most americans another prevalent topic of discussion is healthcare
2163974 americans have a right to expect access to affordable high quality patient centered health care that does not have to mean a one size fits all plan run by clipboard wielding washington bureaucrats or a program for seniors which denies them choice of physicians
2163975 the two major factors behind these rising health care costs are government run programs and employer provided insurance
2163976 and we should also work to ensure that low income children are insured
2163977 one potential solution is to level the health insurance playing field and reduce the governments intrusion into healthcare
2163978 we live in an economy where more and more people regularly switch jobs
2163979 already in the late middle ages calls for free trade could be heard in the english parliament

2164003 the growing social prestige of the sufis attracted self seekers who posed as sufis and dervishes and embarked upon exploiting the goodwill of the people these pretenders indulged in superstitious practices neglected moral order and religious ordinances and boasted of their ignorance and lack of learning in order to cover their own lack of discipline and dedication to the goal some of these charlatans even tried to cut sufism from its very roots namely the quran and the practice of the prophet pbuh the acts of these pseudo sufis never altered the true course of sufism the heart of sufism remained pure well guarded by the traditional practice of the initiation of a seeker into a sufi order by a sufi master the masters authority had properly been passed upon him by a previous master through the investiture of the traditional mantle of authority symbolized by the presentation of a patched cloth this initiation is supported by the tree of lineage going back through all the previous masters to the prophet pbuh from whom the authority to instruct in the esoteric doctrine originated even today this is the general practice of all the recognized sufi orders

2164037 following the success of our existing london stores we are looking at new retail opportunities in the right locations
2164038 the luxury sector and particularly the womens denim market continues to grow both here and in the states as customers with limited funds invest in quality pieces
2164039 it has been a complete financial loss this year all the programmes we printed are now for the waste paper basket we have lost a lot of money but we will just have to watch what we are doing next year we knew that some year we were going to have a disaster so we have always been very careful with our funds
2164040 usually the rain comes down the dornoch firth and blows over but this was just coming straight down and not moving
2164041 it flooded just beyond the entrance to the field and turned it into a lake it was horrendous anyone coming in had to dodge away round the other side of the field you couldnt walk down the normal route
2164042 we tried our hardest to keep the games running and to take the decision to cancel most of the afternoon programme was not easy
2164043 this seems to me a development by the back door to say the very least it is just being sneaked in without any discussion or approval from anyone i am afraid that unless quick and firm action is taken it will just steamroller ahead
2164044 it needs to be fully investigated and the impact on the town considered what sort of people are going to live there if there are going to be families they will need healthcare and education facilities what about the traffic and the roads infrastructure there are so many unknowns
2164045 someone in the council needs to take charge of this one department should be in charge and co ordinate the efforts of the others to come to some sort of consensus and that does not seem to be happening
2164046 there was a load of hoo ha about the new town houses in dornoch square and a fair amount of discussion about the tulloch construction housing scheme at the meadows
2164047 yet here we are going to park 70 dwellings at pitgrudy for full time occupants and yet there has been no discussion or consideration of the impact for dornoch itself
2164048 this is not a nimby not in my back yard attitude all i am saying is that if due process is gone through and at the end of the day it is felt to be a good thing for dornoch then so be it but it appears that it is going through the back door whether we like it or not
2164049 i am most certainly not objecting to a caravan site pitgrudy was a lovely little site and we enjoyed hearing the children playing there and a lot of nice people holidayed at the site but this is different
2164050 there is planning permission for a caravan site at pitgrudy which dates back quite to 1969
2164051 it does not have any restrictions or conditions on it in terms of use or the type of caravan that is allowed to be sited there it does not matter whether they are for holiday or residential use
2164052 the second issue is the two storey structure that has been put up is that a caravan or is it not at the moment the information we have is that it is not a caravan if it does not disappear shortly then we will be chasing them
2164053 the definition of a caravan in legal terms dates back to 1960 when a caravan was a box that you stuck on the back of your car and then went off and lived in it for a short holiday
2164054 a caravan now can be a variety of different things a lot of the chalet structures you see now are caravans in terms of the legislation the general publics reaction would be that is not a caravan but the fact is that legally it is a caravan
2164055 whilst our immediate reaction was that the structure at pitgrudy was not a caravan we are conscious that this is a company that specialises in caravans and we wondered whether they were testing the definition that is why weve asked our solicitor to look into the matter

2164066 jika anda ingin memuaskan mata anda maka apa yang anda lakukan
2164067 jika anda ingin memuaskan telinga anda maka apa yang anda lakukan
2164068 jika yang ingin anda puaskan adalah penciuman hidung maka apa yang anda lakukan
2164069 aku mencium parfum atau pergi ke taman untuk mencium bunga
2164070 dan ketika anda ingin memuaskan penciuman hidung mengapa anda tidak melihat pemadangan yang indah
2164071 baik kini aku telah sampai kepada apa yang aku inginkan dari diri anda
2164072 tidak tetapi aku merasakan itu di dalam hatiku di dalam dadaku
2164073 anda merasakan kesempitan itu di dalam hati anda padahal hati juga membutuhkan kepuasan tersendiri yang tidak akan mungkin dipenuhi dengan cara memuaskan anggota badan selainnya maka anda harus mengetahui apa saja yang dapat memberikan kepuasan hati batin karena dengan mendengarkan musik meminum khamer memandang dan berzina yang anda lakukan itu tidak akan mungkin dapat memuaskan hati anda
2164074 dengan bersaksi bahwa tidak ada sesembahan yang hak selain allah dan bahwa muhammad shallallahu alaihi wasallam adalah utusan allah dan anda bersujud di hadapan allah yang menciptakan anda mengadukan segenap kesedihan hanya kepada allah subhanahu wataala dan dengan itu anda akan merasakan kehidupan yang lapang penuh ketenangan dan kebahagiaan

2164085 no one knows whom if anyone the president is listening to these days or whether there is in the administration anyone challenging his judgment and pleading with him to take a hard look at the available courses of action and inaction in any event the view of most observers here is that the only alternative to a compromise that would surely be humiliating to the government is a war that it is in no way not even militarily prepared to wage in dealing with a country which we do not recognize which we bar from membership in the un and with which we have no normal relations of any kind our power avails us little we have nothing to threaten but destruction and nothing but destruction to withhold there is little to negotiate except that which by definition is not negotiable until a week ago it was generally felt here that no republican with a chance of getting his partys nomination could defeat lydon johnson in november assuming the election to be held in an atmosphere not very different from the one that prevailed in early january it is doubtful however if many of those who felt confident of their analyses of two or three weeks ago could have been persuaded to make any bets on the outcome in november for it seems far less likely than it generally does at this stage of an election year that the present mood of the country will hold through the months ahead not even those who can settle on means of advancing their one issue politics white radicals and negro militants even in their separate and increasingly separatist movements are divided over whether any of them ought to take part in electoral politics at all the labor movement is riven within itself and its historic alliance with the liberal and intellectual communities seems ended conservatives are divided over whether ronald regan deserves to be called a conservative nearly all of this is the heritage of vietnam the one war in this century that has not created at least a temporary national unity more war seems bound to be accompanied by more disunity

2164144 by looking at the criteria first we can be confident that the second stage will only involve sites that are feasible and suitable

2164156 bottom line is this has been going on for a long time and this is the first time weve seen it raised by legislative auditors
2164157 these local projects have long been supported its not like this has been conducted in secret
2164158 it is clearly worth a debate on legislation as to how globally the program should be defined and used
2164159 i dont want to pass judgment on a certain project but if youre starting to do more indoor bricks and mortar projects that would raise some concerns
2164160 not that i wouldnt support those activities theyre good for the community too but at the same time with the lack of open space out there and the needs for funds to purchase open space we should not be using the funds for something else

2164172 i am greatly disappointed with the epas inability to look past the good intentions of this policy to see the significant harm it is doing to farmers ranchers and american households
2164173 for the epa to assert that this federal mandate is not affecting food prices not only goes against common sense but every americans grocery bill
2164174 the administrator didnt mention anything to the governor about the livestock industry
2164175 however is that the result of the renewable fuels standard mandate our conclusion is no
2164176 and second are those price increases meeting the statutory requirement of severe harm to the economy and our conclusion is no
2164177 instead the misguided corn ethanol mandate is forcing farmers to plow up marginal land and wildlife habitat while increasing global warming and dumping toxic fertilizers and pesticides into our precious water sources
2164178 i am disappointed that the epa missed this opportunity to provide relief for american consumers who are dealing with skyrocketing food prices due to the unintended consequences of the continued escalation of the ethanol mandate
2164179 continue to plan for and meet the fuel and food needs of the future

2164346 bagi orang mumin rumah sesungguhnya adalah surga jannah sebab adam a s bermula sebagai penghuni surga dan bakal kembali ke surga karena itu seorang mumin hendaknya tidak menjadikan dunia ini sebagai rumah yang sesungguhnya dan hendaknya hidup di dunia ini bagai seorang musafir asing kita harus berhati hati dan bersungguh sungguh menempuh perjalanan safar karena harus kembali ke rumah dengan selamat
2164347 janganlah engkau hinakan aku ya allah pada hari mereka dibangkitkan yaitu hari di mana tidak bermanfaat harta kekayaan maupun anak keturunan kecuali orang orang yang menghadap kepada allah dengan hati yang selamat bersih
2164348 cari hatimu di tiga tempat taman pada saat mendengarkan quran pada saat berada di majlis majlis dzikir dan pada saat sedang menyendiri kalau kamu tidak mendapatkan hatimu sendiri di tiga tempat taman itu maka segera mohonlah kepada allah taala hati yang lain yang hidup karena sesungguhnya ketika itu kamu tidak mempunyai hati lagi
2164349 sesungguhnya allah taala mengangkat derajat sejumlah kaum dengan kitab quran ini dan merendahkan derajat kaum yang lain dengannya pula
2164350 tidaklah satu kaum berkumpul di salah satu rumah masjid allah mereka membaca quran dan mempelajarinya kecuali turun allah turunkan kepada mereka sakinah ketenangan hati dan bercurahan kepada mereka rahmat kasih sayang allah dan para malaikat mengayomi mereka dan allah menyebutnya termasuk orang orang yang berhak di sisi nya
2164351 hitunglah dirimu sebelum kamu dihitung dan timbanglah dirimu sebelum ditimbang
2164352 apakah aku tidak ingin menjadi hamba allah yang senantiasa bersyukur
2164353 mengapa aku selalu disalahkan dan tidak boleh melakukan apa saja yang kuinginkan mengapa tidak ada kelonggaran sungguh aku tidak menyuruh kecuali apa apa yang baik dan enak
2164354 jika keberadaanku untuk mengajak kepada keburukan maka bagaimana mungkin engkau dapat mengubahku
2164355 hawa nafsu itu ada beberapa macam ada yang memerintahkan keburukan amaratun bissuu ada nafsu pencela lawwamah dan nafsu yang baik tenang muth mainnah namun mengapa nafsu selalu dianggap buruk
2164356 jangan memperbesar masalah iman itu adanya di hati selagi hati masih muthmainnah beriman maka mengapa musti khawatir secara berlebihan
2164357 maka datanglah sesudah mereka pengganti yang jelek yang menyia nyiakan shalat dan memperturutkan hawa nafsunya maka kelak mereka akan menemui kesesatan
2164358 maka hendaklah orang orang yang menyalahi perintah nya takut akan ditimpa cobaan atau ditimpa azab yang pedih an nur 63
2164359 apakah engkau lupa bahwa allah adalah maha pengampun lagi penyayang dan rahmat nya meliputi segala sesuatu
2164360 ketahuilah bahwa sesungguhnya allah amat berat siksa nya dan bahwa sesungguhnya allah maha pengampun lagi maha penyayang
2164361 sesungguhnya allah tidak akan mengampuni dosa syirik dan dia mengampuni segala dosa yang selain dari syirik itu bagi siapa yang dikehendaki nya
2164362 barangsiapa yang mengerjakan kejahatan niscaya akan diberi pembalasan dengan kejahatan itu
2164363 apa manfaatnya allah menyiksa kita apakah dia butuh itu sedangkan ampunan nya tidak akan mengurangi kekuasaan nya sedikit pun dan adzab nya tidak menambah kekuasaan nya sama sekali
2164364 maka apakah patut kami menjadikan orang orang islam itu sama dengan orang orang yang berdosa orang kafir al qalam 35
2164365 yang dincaman itu hanya dosa dosa besar seperti zina mencuri liwath sihir minum khamer membunuh dan sebagainya adapun dosa dosa kecil maka masalahnya amatlah ringan dan tidak perlu dikhawatirkan
2164366 tidak ada dosa kecil kalau dilakukan terus menerus dan tidak ada dosa besar kalau dibarengi istighfar
2164367 jangan engkau memandang kepada kecilnya dosa namun lihatlah kepada siapa engkau bermaksiat
2164368 waspadalah kalian terhadap dosa dosa kecil karena kalau dosa itu berkumpul pada seseorang akan membinasakannya
2164369 seluruh dosa adalah sudah takdir dan kehendak allah kita hanya sekedar menjalankan saja tak mampu mengelak terhadap takdir itu kalau allah berkehendak tentu kita tidak melakukan dosa dan tentu banyak melakukan ketaatan

2164372 apa yang mesti ia takutkan atau ia harapkan dari saya sehingga ia harus mempertontonkan sikap khusyu nya kepada saya
2164373 mengapa ia berpura pura terhadapku dan tidak berpura pura terhadap kalian
2164374 apakah ia memperlihatkan kepada kalian bahwa ia minum khamr jika demikian berarti kalian adalah sekutu sekutunya kalau tidak bagaimana kalian mempersaksikan sesuatu yang tidak kalian lihat

2164550 well done catherine i want a picture of you with that pair of pants
2164551 according to mitchell neglecting schoolwork and studying in lieu of perusing cyberspace is a definite sign of internet addiction
2164552 we are slavs who came to this area in the sixth century we are not descendants of the ancient macedonians
2164553 we do not claim to be descendants of alexander the great greece is macedonias second largest trading partner and its number one investor instead of opting for war we have chosen the mediation of the united nations with talks on the ambassadorial level under mr vance and mr nemitz
2164554 we are not related to the northern greeks who produced leaders like philip and alexander the great we are a slav people and our language is closely related to bulgarian
2164555 there is some confusion about the identity of the people of my country
2164556 the aetolians the acarnanians the macedonians men of the same speech are united or disunited by trivial causes that arise from time to time
2164557 general paulus took his official seat surrounded by the whole crowd of macedonians his announcement was translated into greek and repeated by gnaeus octavius the praetor
2164558 u doba rimske invazije njihov jezik bio gr ki ali se dva veka ranije dosta razlikovao od njega mada ne toliko da se ta dva naroda nisu mogla sporazumevati
2164559 sire what grieves the macedonians is that you have already made some persians your kinsmen and the persians are called kinsmen of alexander and are allowed to kiss you while not one of the macedonians has been granted this honor
2164560 it may have nothing to do with historical fact any more than the orators tirades against their personal enemies usually have
2164561 alexander son of philip and the greeks except the lacedaemonians dedicate these spoils taken from the persian who dwell in asia
2164562 in view of the small part which the greeks had played in the battle the inscription with the omission of any mention of the macedonians must be regarded as propaganda designed for his greek allies alexander does not fail to stress the absence of the spartans
2164563 it is often forgotten that ancient macedonia occupied only a relatively small part of the yugoslav macedonia
2164564 when we take into account the political conditions religion and morals of the macedonians our conviction is strengthened that they were a greek race and akin to the dorians

2164570 when i was your age i always did it for half an hour a day why sometimes ive believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast
2164571 to everything turn turn turn there is a season turn turn turn
2164572 it looked a bit like an irregular galaxy but i wasnt sure what it was
2164573 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
2164574 there was a time when i spoke pejoratively of armchair astronomers and ive gotten up at a star party and publicly apologized for that
2164575 we were overwhelmed by the response it completely melted the server
2164576 people tell us its addictive some of the volunteers are professional astronomers but most of them are not theyre just regular people who got excited about the project
2164577 my astronomy background doesnt really go further than looking at the stars when walking outside in the evening
2164578 its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
2164579 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
2164580 its amazing to think that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
2164581 what excites me the most is that all of this leads to more interest in science
2164582 i hate comments and commenting turned them off on my blogs i think a passive blog relationship is better too many asshole trolls out there
2164583 above 35 mph there is an external combustion system which is basically a heater that uses a little bit of gasoline or biofuel or ethanol or vegetable oil that will heat the air
2164584 heating the air increases its volume and by increasing its volume it increases the cars range thats why with one gallon of gasoline or its equivalent we are able to make over 100 mpg
2164585 no ones really proven a six seater passenger car can get any better than 75 miles to the gallon so this would represent a big step forward
2164586 they would have to prove that before they can throw rocks at the prius
2164587 that is above what you normally find even in an industrial setting
2164588 that takes quite a compressor to do it takes horsepower to compress the air up to that pressure
2164589 can win a stage race for clean production capable vehicles that exceed 100 mpg equivalent fuel economy
2164590 the project is under progress we do not yet have any timeframe for launch
2164591 do you think somebody would actually put millions of dollars into making a car that will not pass safety regulations theres no point in doing that
2164592 i dont think we should discount this advance if it happens
2164593 we do not plan to reissue packaging but will offer a free downloadable cover in the coming days on easports com featuring brett favre in a jets uniform

2164606 that in tracing these evils to their origin every man had found it in the turbulence and follies of democracy
2164607 remember democracy never lasts long it soon wastes exhausts and murders itself there was never a democracy yet that did not commit suicide
2164608 between a balanced republic and a democracy the difference is like that between order and chaos

2164623 classical its typically have a somewhat rigid architecture of first i ask a question then i wait for a response then i talk some more then i wait for another response facial expression recognition i believe will allow the feedback from student to teacher to happen while the robot teacher is talking
2164624 the its which have been developed are already better teachers than people who have no experience
2164625 the traditional model of learning is consistently shown as one of the worst ways to teach people its much better for a student to have one on one interaction
2164626 i see textbooks falling away and students having large numbers of software packages
2164627 in time we will see the end of the monopoly of classroom instruction with age segregation we will see many different types of learning environments we can truly close educational achievement gaps through constructive use of the technology
2164628 children in the future will be able to explore and learn about domains at far younger ages and with far greater results through computational approaches they will be able to work with and learn from people around the world through connectivity they will be able to learn without boundaries
2164629 in life not every moment is a learning experience this gives the students ten times more experience compared to traditional methods
2164630 my goal in this research is not to change how people learn but rather to adapt computer and robot interfaces to how people learn im trying to bring the robot teachers to us not the other way around
2164631 the technology is not the most difficult part helping institutions to change and adapt to enable the new possibilities is the most difficult element what is needed is vision and political will

2164654 plants absorb carbon dioxide co2 from the atmosphere as plant roots die the carbon molecules remain permanently stored in the soil
2164655 ducks unlimited will pay landowners for offsetting the amount of co2 released into the air from other human sources
2164656 some of the most promising land management practices for enhancing carbon accumulations in soils promoting terrestrial sequestration also improve the quantity and quality of waterfowl habitat
2164657 climate change will have a significant impact on ducks in addition ducks need large expanses of grassland for successful nesting
2164658 with the emergence of new markets for carbon credits we are attempting to raise additional funds for habitat conservation through the sale of carbon offsets

2164668 in this life sometimes we have to express our feeling or what we want to our parents siblings teachers and friends we know that they care bout us and they should know everything about us but at the same time they are not psychic they wont know how we feel and what we want sometimes we have to cry out for help and not bounded by our ego we are not weak if we ask for help we are just human let other people help us by helping them to know our problem

2164685 suggested that the impasse betweeen rationalism and orthodoxy could be solved if human experience specifically the feeling of absolute dependency rather than authoritative propositions about god were to be seen as the source of theology
2164686 schleiermacher believed that religious experience is primary theology in turn is secondary and must constantly be reformed in relation to the changing aspects of christian communities
2164687 every doctrinal form is bound to a particular time and no claim can be made for its permanent validity it is the task of theology in every present age by critical reflection to express anew the implications of the living religious consciousness
2164688 trying to speak about god by speaking about humankind in a very loud voice
2164689 schleiermacher began the trend within modern christian thought toward loss of transcendence by refusing to acknowledge the possibility that god might wish to speak a word or commit an act that could not be anticipated within the horizon of human experience
2164690 the brown tree snake has often been used as a textbook example for the negative impacts of invasive species but after the loss of birds no one has looked at the snakes indirect effects
2164691 it has been 25 years since the birds disappeared it seems to me the consequences are going to keep reverberating throughout the community if birds are fundamental components of the forest
2164692 these findings could have global implications since forests in areas that have had a decline in bird populations instead of outright extinction might show effects similar to those in the forests of guam
2164693 it seems logical that if there are no birds then seeds are not able to get away from their parent trees and that is exactly what our research shows
2164694 the magnitude of difference between seed dispersal on guam and saipan is alarming because of its implications for guams forests and for forests worldwide experiencing a decline or complete loss of birds

2164698 the visible church which is also catholic or universal under the gospel not confined to one nation as before under the law consists of all those throughout the world that profess the true religion and of their children
2164699 by a credible profession is meant a profession of the true relgion sufficiently intelligent and sufficiently corroborated by the daily life of the professor to be credited as genuine
2164700 you see a person is justified by works and not by faith alone
2164701 however it cannot be denied that there may be and actually are unregenerate person in the visible church hence it may be said to comprise both believers and unbelievers such as are truly christians and such as are merely professed or nominal christians
2164702 they went out from us but they were not of us for if they had been of us they would have continued with us but they went out that it might become plain that they all are not of us
2164703 the catholic or universal church which is invisible consists of the whole number of the elect that have been are or shall be gathered into one under christ the head thereof and is the spouse the body the fullness of him that filleth all in all
2164704 on the other hand the invisible church consists exclusively of those who by the grace of the holy spirit have been born again
2164705 for not all who are descended from israel belong to israel and not all the children of abraham because they are his offspring but through isaac shall your offspring be named this means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of god but the children of promise are counted as offspring

2164736 logically only one city can have the best fans in the world
2164737 oh theyre probably better than the top 20 even high teens
2164738 i mean i was just ballparking and since the market is so small i figured top 20 would have been a compliment but to say the best well thats just silly i mean we couldnt even fill up the rca dome but the patriots shut down boston and their fans line the streets outdoors in the cold for the entire celebration i might add whenever they win the super bowl

2164740 while hundreds of english couples danced to american jazz music last night in the ballroom of the hotel savoy in london thousands of radio enthusiasts in the united states from the eastern seaboard as far west as milwaukee listened to the same music brought to their home by the first successful experiment in double radio relaying
2164741 the people of the united states have received a new gift from radio the culture and music of london have come to them through the air
2164742 the first trans atlantic broadcast march 14 1925 representing a technological breakthrough this early orchestral broadcast originated in london traveled by land line to station 5xx in chelmsford crossed the atlantic where it was picked up by an rca transmitter in maine and relayed to stations wjz in new york and wrc in washington d c although the fidelity is low the recording is significant as a documentation of a technical achievement and a very rare instance of an extant example of a complete radio broadcast of the 1920s the entire 37 minute broadcast survives on discs in the collections of the university of marylands library of american broadcasting
2164743 recordings of actual radio broadcasts from the 1920s are extremely rare and recordings from before the formation of the nbc and cbs networks in 1926 and 1927 respectively are even more so technology was the main reason as electrical as opposed to acoustic recording was not perfected until 1925 because of this scarcity this recording transcribed on one side of a series of thick discs on march 14th 1925 would be of historical interest no matter what the content the fact that it is a recording of the first scheduled transatlantic broadcast via shortwave converted and sent to the listening public on the am band makes it truly important though the static laden music from london has little value as entertainment its significance as an invisible link between britain and the u s was tremendous

2164835 tiap kali orang membicarakan abu chik aku selalu menangkap kegelisahan di wajah
2164836 aku melihat ada sandiwara di sini di balik kematian abu chik aku mencium bau busuk di antara orang orang kita bahkan orang yang paling dekat dengan kita bau itu samar samar tercium dan seperti tak terasa karena begitu pandainya si penipu itu membalutnya dengan keharuman yang menyengat padahal bau itu sangat berbisa bahkan bisa menjalar ke ulu hati hingga membunuh siapapun yang menciumnya hal itu sungguh sangat berbahaya
2164837 kemana harus kubawa mukaku ini rasanya aku ingin mati saja mengikuti langkah abu chik sungguh aku tak kuat lagi menanggung beban ini jika abu chik masih ada tentu akan begini kejadiannya
2164838 bagaimana nyak bisa menjalani hidup mandiri jika terlalu berharap pasrah pada orang yang telah tiada nyak tak boleh berkata seperti itu ini hanyalah cobaan nyak harus sabar dan tegar menghadapi semua kenyataan ini

2164850 adakah engkau melihat aku membawa kayu bakar dan apakah engkau melihat dileherku ada kalung dari bulu unta
2164851 hai abu bakar benarkah sahabatmu itu selalu menghina aku begini begitu
2164852 tidak pernah dia tidak menghina kamu dia hanya membacakan firman allah kok
2164853 dan barangsiapa yang mentaati allah dan rasul nya mereka itu akan bersama sama dengan orang orang yang dianugerahi nikmat oleh allah yaitu nabi nabi para shiddiiqiin orang orang yang mati syahid dan orang orang shaleh dan mereka itulah teman yang sebaik baiknya
2164854 muhammad kan seorang nabi mana mungkin kita bisa menyamai dirinya
2164855 sesungguhnya pada kisah kisah mereka itu terdapat pengajaran bagi orang orang yang mempunyai akal al quran itu bukanlah cerita yang dibuat buat akan tetapi membenarkan kitab kitab yang sebelumnya dan menjelaskan segala sesuatu dan sebagai petunjuk dan rahmat bagi kaum yang beriman
2164856 dan sesungguhnya telah kami jadikan kapal itu sebagai pelajaran maka adakah orang yang mau mengambil pelajaran
2164857 hai orang orang mumin jika kamu menolong diin allah niscaya dia akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu
2164858 dan allah telah berjanji kepada orang orang yang beriman di antara kamu dan mengerjakan amal amal yang saleh bahwa dia sungguh sungguh akan menjadikan mereka berkuasa di bumi sebagaimana dia telah menjadikan orang orang yang sebelum mereka berkuasa dan sungguh dia akan meneguhkan bagi mereka din yang telah diridai nya untuk mereka dan dia benar benar akan menukar keadaan mereka sesudah mereka berada dalam ketakutan menjadi aman sentosa mereka tetap mengabdi ku dengan tiada mempersekutukan sesuatu apa pun dengan aku dan barang siapa yang tetap kafir sesudah janji itu maka mereka itulah orang orang yang fasik
2164859 keadaan mereka serupa dengan keadaan firaun dan pengikut pengikutnya serta orang orang yang sebelumnya mereka mengingkari ayat ayat allah maka allah menyiksa mereka disebabkan dosa dosanya sesungguhnya allah maha kuat lagi amat keras siksaan nya
2164860 dan mereka tidak menghormati allah dengan penghormatan yang semestinya di kala mereka berkata
2164861 siapakah yang menurunkan kitab taurat yang dibawa oleh musa sebagai cahaya dan petunjuk bagi manusia kamu jadikan kitab itu lembaran lembaran kertas yang bercerai berai kamu perlihatkan sebagiannya dan kamu sembunyikan sebagian besarnya padahal telah diajarkan kepadamu apa yang kamu dan bapak bapak kamu tidak mengetahui nya
2164862 dan berjihadlah kamu pada jalan allah dengan sebenar benarnya jihad dia telah memilih kamu dan dia sekali kali tidak menjadikan kamu kesempitan dengan din ini yaitu millah ibrahim sebagai bapakmu dia allah telah menamakan kamu sekalian orang orang muslim dari dahulu dan juga didalam al quran ini supaya rasul itu menjadi contoh nyata bagi kamu sekalian dan supaya kamu juga menjadi contoh bagi segenap manusia maka tegakkanlah shalat laksanakanlah zakat dan berpeganglah teguhlah kalian pada perjanjian allah dia adalah pelindung kamu sekalia dan sebaik baik penolong
2164863 katakanlah kami beriman kepada allah dan kepada apa yang diturunkan kepada kami kepada apa yang diturunkan kepada ibrahim ismail ishaq yaqub dan anak anaknya dan kepada apa yang diturunkan kepada musa isa dan kepada semua nabi yang mendapat ajaran dari rab mereka
2164864 karena mereka melanggar perjanjian dengan allah kami kutuk mereka dan kami jadikan qolbu mereka keras membatu mereka suka sekali merubah kalimat allah dari tempatnya dan mereka seringkali melupakan sebagian dari apa yang telah diperingatkan kepadanya dan engkau akan senantiasa melihat pengkhianatan mereka kecuali sebahagian kecil dari mereka maka maafkanlah mereka sesungguhnya allah menyukai orang orang yang berbuat baik
2164865 apakah akan kami beritahukan kepadamu tentang orang orang yang paling merugi perbuatannya
2164866 semua orang menjadi murtad setelah meninggalnya rasulullah kecuali 3 2 karena konsisten dengan prinsip yang menyamakan imamah dengan nubuwwah dalam pengertian bahwa masing masing mereka adalah merupakan posisi yang ditugaskan oleh allah
2164867 imam setelah aku adalah duabelas yang pertama adalah amir ali ibn abi talib dan yang terakhir adalah qaim mahdi ketaatan kepada mereka adalah ketaatan kepada saya dan penentangan kepada mereka adalah penentangan kepada saya seperti itulah siapapun yang menolak salah satu dari mereka telah menolak aku
2164868 siapapun yang menyangkal ali dan imamahnya setelah aku telah menolak nubuwwah ku dan siapapun menyangkal aku perihal nubuwwah ku telah menolak allah tuhanan nya
2164869 siapapun meragukan kufr dari musuh kami menjadikan dirinya seorang kafir
2164870 ya tuhan kami anugrahkanlah kepada kami isteri isteri kami dan keturunan kami sebagai penyenang hati dan jadikanlah kami imam imaaman bagi orang orang yang bertakwa al furqan 74
2164871 itu merupakan sesuatu hal yang luar biasa bagi mereka memohon kepada allah untuk menjadikan mereka imam muttaqiin
2164872 pada kenyataannya komentar dari imam al baqir dan as sadiq
2164873 kami akan menyebutkan dan menginformasikan tentang itu yang mencapai kita yang penasihat kami dan para perawi yang dapat dipercaya telah menceriterakan
2164874 ali ibn ibrahim al qummi telah bersaksi bahwa tafsirnya diceriterakan dari imam oleh perawi yang dapat dipercaya

2164877 berpaling dengan menyombongkan diri seolah olah dia belum mendengarnya seakan akan ada sumbat di kedua telinganya
2164878 masuklah kamu ke kota ini dan makanlah dari hasil buminya yang banyak lagi enak di mana yang kamu sukai dan masukilah pintu gerbangnya sujjadan dan katakanlah bebaskanlah kami dari dosa niscaya kami ampuni kesalahan kesalahanmu dan kelak kami akan menambah kepada orang orang yang berbuat baik
2164879 diamlah di kota ini saja dan makanlah darinya di mana saja kamu kehendaki
2164880 maka hendaklah thoo ifatun yang pertama adalah di depan thoo ifatun yang kedua
2164881 wahai ayahku inilah takbir mimpiku yang dahulu itu sesungguhnya tuhanku telah menjadikannya suatu kenyataan dan sesungguhnya tuhanku telah berbuat baik kepadaku ketika dia membebaskan aku dari rumah penjara dan ketika membawa kamu dari dusun padang pasir setelah setan menempatkan keretakan antaraku dan saudara saudaraku sesungguhnya tuhanku maha lembut terhadap apa yang dia kehendaki sesungguhnya dia lah yang maha mengetahui lagi maha bijaksana
2164882 bersihkanlah rumah ku untuk orang orang yang tawaf orang orang yang iktikaf orang orang yang rukuk yang sujud

2164935 and enjoin prayer on thy people and be constant therein we ask thee not for provision it is we that provide for thee and the end is for the righteous
2164936 recite that which has been revealed to thee of the book and observe prayer surely prayer restrains one from indecency and manifest evil and remembrance of allah indeed is the greatest virtue and allah knows what you do
2164937 tell me if one of you had a stream running at his door and he should take a bath in it five times every day would any dirt be left upon him he was answered no dirt would be left on him the holy prophet peace and blessings be on him observed this is the case of the five prayers allah wipes out all faults in consequence of them

2164948 mutual customers are looking for devices for similar features and functionality so we have to partner up and leverage the r amp d expertise
2164949 one of the big subtexts of this announcement is that of device convergence in software there are so many patents and people are innovating the same things
2164950 when you have huge portfolios with thousands of patents microsoft wants to know that they might have some raw freedom to look at a samsung device to look at the functionality and how it performs and try to mimic it
2164951 if anything it removes one hurdle for engineers to learn from one another
2164952 we felt the need for an extra boost in our existing software technologies convergence of broadcasting and it will demand new services features and functionalities like iptv
2164953 through this patent collaboration with microsoft samsung will use microsofts advanced it software technologies to enhance samsungs software for future products
2164954 the lines are blurring between the consumer electronics and it industry so without proactive collaboration in advance one cannot avoid possible disputes in the future
2164955 an indication that there are some areas within consumer products that microsoft is interested in
2164956 samsung isnt going to be a device company forever and as they look at software functionality there are some indications that these worlds are coming together
2164957 they have a significant number of patents and theyve been steadily increasing it really speaks to microsoft looking beyond traditional
2164958 patent licensing is a way for companies to avoid becoming embroiled in suits
2164959 it opens the door to intellectual property that can be leveraged in products and microsoft is clearly looking to leverage its investment in r amp d as a bartering tool for use with other technology companies
2164960 mostly something that helps microsoft build up its own patent portfolio
2164961 microsoft wants mobile pcs and that is cheaper with flash memory than disk drives

2165046 significa que no volver hasta saber si soy culpable o no cierto
2165047 pero no tengo ninguna prueba y es lo que olgierd necesita para creerme
2165048 pero olgierd nunca se equivoca cuando investiga as que comprobar que eres inocente tambi n
2165049 olgierd ha ayudado al rey en varias ocasiones es de confianza para l

2165058 no pero ser a una l stima que lo ejecuten si ndolo llegar al fondo de todo esto
2165059 rey okietek encontr al culpable su nombre es auron perd neme por descubrirlo unos segundos antes de mi muerte
2165060 mientras corr amos por el pasillo nos tropezamos con marietta y witold quienes por los gritos hab an salido del cuarto en el que practicaban alcanc a advertirles
2165061 en cuanto zien choc contra m me grit que el tipo de la puerta estaba loco mi sorpresa fu al ver que se trataba de nuestro jefe el auron no pod a creerlo sacaba su espada ensangrentada del cuerpo sin vida de olgierd al fondo v a syfka tambi n muerta
2165062 por qu la persona que nos salv de la calle ahora nos estaba matando
2165063 viv con la hermana de mi madre desde que tengo uso de raz n una mujer que nunca conoci el amor y la menos indicada para criar a un ni o o cr a humana como ella me llamaba
2165064 seg n mi t a mi padre abandon a mi madre por otra mujer cuando estaba embarazada de m as que tuvo que mudarse con su nica hermana mi madre siempre me culpaba a n antes de nacer en medio de su coraje y desesperaci n se descuid y tuvo complicaciones muri al momento de darme a luz
2165065 mi t a no ten a el m s m nimo inter s en m simplemente me daba comida y una cama por que le daba l stima de ah en fuera no le importaba lo que hiciera
2165066 aprend a pelear desde muy joven y me hice el m s fuerte de mi pandilla a los 14 as que me volv el jefe pero no dur mucho
2165067 un d a el genocidio lleg a mi aldea un grupo de personas que se ve an raro llegaron y empezaron a matar a todos incendiaban las casas y destru an lo que se les pon a enfrente mataron a mi t a frente a m que buscaba refugio en casa despu s de eso incendiaron la casa sin tocarme a n sabiendo que estaba ah
2165068 justo en el ltimo momento por la ventana entr alguien igual de raro pero diferente a los dem s me extendi la mano y me protegi de la muerte que me acechaba
2165069 al d a siguiente despert aqu en el refugio est bamos la persona que me salv que se present ante m como auron syfka xin y kazi
2165070 syfka era una hu rfana que viv a en la calle con su hermana menor de las limosnas de la gente siempre cuidaba de su hermana y trabajaba con la motivaci n de darle de comer lo suficiente para vivir un d a m s un pedazo de pan o alguna verdura sacada de los desperdicios de las tabernas un d a se vi envuelta en una pelea con un vagabundo por la pieza m s grande de pan que hab a visto a su alcance en toda su vida el vagabundo tom por reh n a su hermana menor y amenaz con matarla si no le entregaba el pan syfka no hab a comido en d as por darle toda la comida a su hermanita por lo que dud un momento el tipo la mat enseguida syfka se jur nunca volver a dudar y siempre ayudar a cualquiera que estuviera en problemas por m s peque o que fuera d as despu s se encontr con auron quien la llev al refugio
2165071 la historia de xin era la menos conmovedora odiaba a sus padrastros as que huy de casa en un momento de esos en los que no piensas en las consecuencias tuvo suerte de encontrarse con auron lleg una hora despu s que syfka al refugio
2165072 kazi era muy reservada y s lo dec a los gatos se comieron a mis padres nunca la tom en serio lleg 2 meses despu s que xin
2165073 el siguiente fue jan 6 meses depu s que yo y siguieron olgierd 4 meses despu s marietta 4 meses despu s de olgierd pyotr 2 meses de diferenciay cuando pens bamos que no habr a m s lleg zien 8 meses despu s y 6 meses antes de este momento
2165074 algo que siempre llam mi atenci n es que todos los que estuvieron antes que yo se encontraron con auron en la panader a merendel luego los que llegaron despu s hab an tenido algo que ver con tal lugar siendo el caso m s explicito el de zien por que trabaj ah adem s de que auron no lo hab a llevado lleg s lo lo que hac a que le tuvi ramos desconfianza al principio pero era un buen chico
2165075 pasaron 3 a os desde que llegaron xin y syfka m s de 2 y medio desde que yo llegu fu lo mejor de mi vida ustedes son mi familia gracias por todo
2165076 soy m s gil puedo darle un par de golpes y dejarlo atontado antes de que me atraviese en ese momento elim nalo
2165077 la agilidad no sirve de nada aqu es un pasillo
2165078 corr hacia l la corta distancia que quedaba entre nosotros y d un salto pero previ mis movimientos muy bien y me cort las manos antes de poder tocarlo no s cu nto grit mientras me tiraba al suelo de una patada estaba a punto de darme el golpe de gracia cuando marietta lo atac pero auron bloque con su espada y le cort la garganta en unos segundos despu s acab conmigo
2165079 lo ataqu en ese momento para que no terminara con witold y fu descuidada bloque mi ataque y cort mi garganta en uno del los movimientos m s r pidos que hab a visto y tambi n el ltimo
2165080 siempre me pareci sospechoso c mo zien hab a llegado no era como nosotros que est bamos aqu con el consentimiento de auron nuestro querido jefe quien nos trajo aqu y nos sac adelante nos ense a hacer muchas cosas me ense a pelear con armas y nos dijo lo que deb amos hacer para sobrevivir nos tra a comida y nos daba mucho dinero al principio mientras no hac amos autosuficientes
2165081 ramos 7 cuando yo llegu y casi un a o despu s ya ramos 9 con la llegada de zien
2165082 esa noche me hab a quedado entrenando hasta tarde witold s lo me estaba viendo
2165083 lo raro es que eres mujer y te gusta normalmente s lo los hombres lo practicamos
2165084 qu significa eso y por que me est s mirando te gusto o algo vete a dormir
2165085 entonces se escuch un fuerte golpe afuera como ramos los nicos despiertos salimos a ver era zien tirado en el suelo despu s de hablarlo un poco decidimos llevarlo adentro y lo acostamos en una de las tantas camas libres era un dormitorio muy grande que nunca llenamos
2165086 a la ma ana siguiente ya avanzada la misma cuando todos est bamos despiertos excepto zien olgierd lleg con noticias nos llev a todos al dormitorio para decirnoslo
2165087 ten an la panader a m s famosa de la ciudad todos los quer an
2165088 hay un desaparecido un muchacho que trabajaba con ellos hace casi un mes
2165089 volteamos a ver a zien en ese momento al parecer era l y al despertar s lo lo confirm l era quien trabajaba ah pero negaba haber hecho tal cosa syfka era la nica tan ingenua como para creerle yo lo trataba mal para que se fuera pero los dem s lo ignoraban hasta que olgierd decidi darle el beneficio de la duda nosostros tambi n lo hicimos
2165090 al darle una oportunidad nos dimos cuenta de que no era mala persona y dejamos de creer que l hab a sido el culpable
2165091 pasaron un par de meses y zien aprendi algo de cada uno de nosotros se hizo muy til nos ayudaba a todos con nuestras labores pero con el que m s pasaba tiempo era con olgierd al parecer le gustaba el conocimiento le a libros y se hizo muy culto aprendi mucho
2165092 nadie dec a nada pero todos est bamos tristes por que el d a de la ejecuci n de zien se acercaba sab amos que le quedaba una semana de vida si olgierd no hac a alg n descubrimiento importante y llevaba meses estancado pero luego esto ocurri te veremos del otro lado zien pyotr no puede escapar jan tampoco pero zien y kazi v yanse hagan una vida juntos por favor siempre me han parecido tiernos pero nunca me atrev a decirlo
2165093 escuch los gritos de witold mientras segu amos corriendo no pod a soportar la desesperaci n y el miedo entramos al dormitorio donde pyotr se recuperaba de las heridas que los animales que tanto amaba le hab an hecho hab a estado al borde de la muerte pero por fin se recuperaba estaba estable y fuera de peligro jan por su parte hab a perdido una pierna por una infecci n peligrosa y era eso o su vida un m dico no necesita sus piernas pero la gente necesita m dicos fu lo que dijo cuando le dieron la noticia
2165094 v a kazi corriendo y jalando a zien entraron al cuarto de las mujeres por los gritos anteriores y las caras que ten an al pasar esos dos supe que algo horrible estaba pasando ten a miedo pero no pod a hacer nada por que no pod a moverme sin ayuda
2165095 despu s vi a auron entrar con una espada manchada de sangre m s bien escurriendo hab a matado a los dem s entend eso
2165096 agach la cabeza y cerr los ojos con fuerza no quer a ver c mo se acercaba s lo quer a que pasara y ya no ten a ninguna opci n por lo menos pyotr estaba dormido
2165097 mi padre era un doctor importante de l gnica nunca le negaba el servicio m dico a nadie sin importar su posici n o su enfermedad lo cual fu su error

2165140 begini coba anda perhatikan di depan sana di jalanan untuk menyadari bahwa tuhan itu tidak ada katakan kepadaku jika tuhan itu ada adakah yang sakit adakah anak terlantar jika tuhan ada tidak akan ada sakit ataupun kesusahan saya tidak dapat membayangkan tuhan yang maha penyayang akan membiarkan ini semua terjadi

2165142 tukang cukur itu tidak ada sebab jika ada tidak akan ada orang dengan
2165143 apa yang kamu lihat itu adalah salah mereka sendiri kenapa mereka tidak datang ke saya
2165144 itulah point utama nya sama dengan tuhan tuhan itu juga ada tapi apa yang terjadi orang orang tidak mau datang kepada nya dan tidak mau mencari nya oleh karena itu banyak yang sakit dan tertimpa kesusahan di dunia ini
2165145 tetapi kami telah mematuhi allah allah telah mengirim kepada kami kitab wahyu dan kami mematuhinya
2165146 allah adalah saksi antara aku dan kamu dan ini diwahyukan kepadaku supaya aku memberi peringatan kepada kamu dengannya dan barang siapa ia sampai
2165147 kamilah yang menurunkan zhikr al quran dan kamilah yang menjaganya
2165148 itulah ayat ayat allah yang kami membacakan kepada kamu dengan benar maka dengan hadis apakah sesudah allah dan ayat ayat nya yang mereka akan mempercayai 45 6
2165149 apa adakah aku akan mencari sembarang hakim selain allah dan dia yang menurunkan kepada kamu al kitab yang cukup jelas dan orang orang yang kepada mereka kami telah memberikan al kitab mengetahui bahawa ia diturunkan dari pemelihara kamu dengan yang benar maka janganlah kamu termasuk orang orang yang ragu ragu
2165150 pada kamu ada satu teladan yang baik dalam rasul allah bagi barang siapa yang mengharapkan allah dan hari akhir dan mengingati allah dengan banyak
2165151 sunnah allah pada orang orang yang telah berlalu sebelum kamu dan kamu akan mendapati tiada pertukaran pada sunnah allah
2165152 dan sesungguhnya mereka hampir mamalingkan kamu dari apa yang telah kami wahyukan kepadamu agar kamu membuat yang lain secara bohong terhadap kami dan kalau sudah begitu tentulah mereka mengambil kamu jadi sahabat yang setia
2165153 satu penurunan dari pemelihara semua alam sekiranya dia mengada adakan terhadap kami sembarang ucapan tentu kami mengambilnya dengan tangan kanan kemudian pasti kami memotong urat jantungnya dan tiadalah seseorang dari kamu yang dapat menghalangi hal itu
2165154 jangan mencatat apapun dariku kecuali al quran siapapun yang menulis selain dari itu agar menghapusnya
2165155 dan kami menurunkan kepada kamu kitab dengan yang benar yang mengesahkan kitab sebelumnya dan mengawalnya
2165156 dan hakimilah di antara mereka menurut apa yang allah turunkan
2165157 sesungguhnya kami menurunkan kepada kamu kitab dengan yang benar supaya kamu menghakimi di antara manusia dengan apa yang allah perlihatkan kepada kamu 4 105

2165162 hai anakku janganlah kamu mempersekutukan allah sesungguhnya mempersekutukan allah adalah benar benar kedholiman yang besar
2165163 sesungguhnya berhala berhala yang kamu sembah selain allah adalah untuk menciptakan perasaan kasih sayang di antara kamu dalam kehidupan dunia ini kemudian di hari kiamat sebahagian kamu mengingkari sebahagian yang lain dan sebahagian kamu melanati sebahagian yang lain dan tempat kembalimu ialah neraka dan sekali kali tak ada bagimu para penolongpun
2165164 mereka itu adalah pemberi syafaat kepada kami di sisi allah
2165165 apakah kamu mengabarkan kepada allah apa yang tidak diketahui nya baik di langit dan tidak pula dibumi
2165166 kami mendapati nenek moyang kami mengerjakan yang demikian itu dan allah menyuruh kami mengerjakannya
2165167 padamu negeri kami berjanji padamu negeri kami mengabdi dengan jiwa dan raga kami
2165168 cukuplah untuk kami apa yang kami dapati bapak bapak kami mengerjakannya

2165170 given the perception of playboy centerfolds as culturally ideal women the notion that 70 of them are underweight highlights the social pressures on women to be thin and helps to explain the high levels of body dissatisfaction and disordered eating among women

2165187 all of those who display tibetan flags demonstrate in front of the chinese embassy protest sign petitions and go to beijing so that for a dozen seconds they can yell slogans or unfurl a banner before chinese security drags them away are living proof that the world hasnt been completely bought off by chinas more or less virtual money

2165218 kami tidak membidahkan dan tidak juga menyesatkan siapa saja yang shalat tarawih lebih dari sebelas rakaat jika tidak jelas baginya sunnah dan dia tidak mengikuti hawa nafsunya 2
2165219 karena itu kita lihat meskipun para ulama berselisih pendapat secara sengit pada sejumlah masalah namun mereka tidak saling menyesatkan dan tidak juga saling membidahkan satu sama lain
2165220 ketahuilah bahwasanya khilaf tentang jumlah bilangan rakaat shalat tarawih dan yang semisalnya yang termasuk perkara perkara yang dibolehkan ijitihad di dalamnya hendaknya tidak dijadikan ajang perselisihan dan perpecahan umat terlebih lagi jika salaf berbeda pendapat pada masalah ini tidak ada satu dalil pun yang melarang berlakunya ijtihad dalam perkara ini

2165222 aku dan syaikh abdurrazzaq seperti tangan yang satu bahkan jari yang satu
2165223 sungguh indah perkataan seorang ulama kepada orang yang menyelisihinya dalam perkara yang dibolehkan ijtihad
2165224 khilaf yang terjadi di antara kita adalah khilaf yang menggabungkan dan tidak mencerai beraikan berbeda dengan khilafnya orang lain

2165281 the 12 hour time difference is a boon for us when the americans are asleep our transcriptionists convert voice files into documents and our clients find the work on their table when a new day dawns

2165290 sometimes you need to leave the game rather than continue if you are not finding happiness anymore especially when people are not being honest i dont think what thanda did to patrick mayo and myself is something that they would be proud of to my mind it was not fair and would destroy the spirit of many a player
2165291 the reason for my disappointment is that when i left durban to go home before the pre season break they said i shouldnt worry a lot about my contract that was expiring at the end of june
2165292 i was told that if the team survived then i would get a two year contract extension while then being gradually integrated into the clubs development structures since i am an experienced player
2165293 looking back i think that was just a way of motivating us to keep on working hard in those trying times for the team
2165294 the sad thing is that there is no honesty in football while i have had to respect the decision they made the manner in which they did it is disappointing
2165295 i mean to return for pre season and then be told your services are no longer needed is really a disappointing way of communication they could have relayed the message earlier so that i could have started thinking about my next move
2165296 as far as i am concerned the club never promised bennett a job in the development structures and he is no longer with the club

2165316 peer pressure and the high cost of education add to the appeal of credit cards using a credit card to pay for school is on the rise then while paying off those credit cards one neglected ones academic work or one may even have to drop out for someone in deep debt they may have to fill bankruptcy or turn to their parent for help some students might stay afloat by using student loans to pay off their debt which is a major problem the government must recognize that there is a problem with teenagers and debts we should consider having a proposal that would allow credit cards to go to people under 21 only if they were financially independent or had parental approval i think that would be a good idea because by the time one turn twenty one he or she will have a level of responsibility if ones parents had to sign for it then he or she would be a little more careful because the card could hurt them too should we resort to plastic surgery for beauty im not against plastic surgery because beauty can be subjective it is man kinds essential nature that entails self improvement and perfection human beings have always sought out self fulfillment through self improvement of course plastic surgeries can be very beneficial for restoring the quality of life to those who has been born with defects been in an accident of any kind that has defaced him her or in anyway has ruined the natural beauty that he she was born with i believe it can help to boost the self confidence of them however i stress that plastic surgery shouldnt be done to impress others but to make you feel good about yourself if one is doing it for the sake to impress others then i believe that he or she is not living a life of freedom but a restricted life would one feel happy with this kind of mentality some people with determination will see past all obstacles in their way so in their eyes they can be more beautiful more like other people or maybe have more self esteem for themselves i believe that cosmetic surgery may not be the answer but it could be for others sabrina lim p0639950 dmtm ft 2a 22 16 should teenagers be allowed to own a credit card no teenagers should not be allowed to use a credit card as most of them are too immature they are unable to resist temptation and would just start swiping their credit card conveniently till they reach the maximum limit and who is going to pay for it their poor parents credit card teaches teenagers who have yet to learn how to save to spend even more parents should give their kids a piggy bank rather than a credit card is public display of affection right or wrong public display of affection is wrong firstly displaying of affection in public is an embarrassing act for the people around them people normally do not know how to react when they see such an act they would normally look away or try to do something else this bring inconvenience to people around them however displaying of affection to a certain extent is still acceptable for example hugging and holding hands if it is intimate kissing and cuddling especially in crowded places like mrt it is definitely a no no should we give ex prisoners a second chance to re enter society as a respected citizen of course everyone deserve a second chance yes they might had committed crimes in the past but they have already been punished by the law we all make mistakes and we all receive a second chance or even a third or a fourth chance so ex prisoners should be given a second chance too what might happen if we do not give these ex prisoners a second chance they would probably feel sad and hopeless and might just commit another offense most ex prisoners would repent and put in extra effort in their job as they feel grateful that they are given a job and would work extra hard to keep the job it benefits them as well as the society so why not 6 online gaming does not numb the mind i agree the statement the online game is like the real world filled with competition but the game designers will make it much more active its more interesting to make achievements people enjoy playing it and people can choose the type which they like and the characters on the other hand we cant choose where we grow up and which kind of family we born in in conclusion its easy for people lose themselves when they play the online games 9 everyone should get involved in social networking websites my space facebook friendster yes i agree we meet some friends in our school and workplace we share the friendship with each other but we may leave them in the future with these websites we can know what they are doing recently from the article from their blog and photographs of course friendship will not be lost moreover we are able to make more new friends in these websites 5 studying abroad a better alternative in my opinion it is true but its a bit challenging they must face that they will live alone without their parents and they must manage all the things by themselves in the environment which they are not familiar with however no pain no gains i suppose they will learn a lot other than receive a better education they can adapt to a new environment easily and they will become more independent among their friends it is very useful when they step into the society should we resort to plastic surgery for beauty being perfect is a common issue but when this issue becomes an obsession it can grow into a far more serious mental illness plastic surgery is a huge obsession among all people including preteens teenagers and adolescents it is an obsession that is fed by models and celebrities who think nothing of going under the scalpel again and again in an elusive chase after a beauty icon that does not exist plastic surgery is not without risk it is not a healthy way to look perfect plastic surgery can affect a person physically socially and mentally and it can have many side effects it is a painful procedure that can even lead to death thus i believe that plastic surgery should not be encouraged should we give ex prisoners a second chance to re enter society as a respected citizen ex prisoners should be given a second chance although they have made a mistake in the past however they should be given a chance to make up for their mistakes after serving their sentence imagine if we do not give them a chance who will who knows hey might be desperate enough to revert to their old ways and commit a crime again when there is a probability they will do good to the society rehabilitation and aftercare efforts are not enough in the long run as ex offenders ultimately have to return to their families and the community as contributing members the community therefore plays an important part in the creation of a stable social environment where ex offenders who really desire to change and their families can feel a sense of belonging and find the hope to start life afresh thus i believe they should be respected should tobacco be banned in singapore yes tobacco shold be banned smoking cigarettes does not only lead to disease and death but drains the already impoverished public health smoking also damages productivity and families as parents die young because of tobacco related illnesses as such singapore has broaden a ban on smoking to include pubs coffee shops and bus stops as part of an aggressive anti tobacco campaign q should euthanasia be legalized my stand is that it should not be legalized legalizing it will not only have a huge negative impact on moral related and religious issues but also on society in general let me try to be as brief as possible statistics show that it is not only the incurable and dying who opt for euthanasia but also those who are very well capable of continuing on with their lives sick or not a shocking 14 of the people who opted for euthanasia are simply bored of their lives no disease no financial issues no nothing just bored and depressed with this piece of information alone can you imagine what the world would come to if euthanasia was made legal think about it this way euthanasia will be simply a form of condoned suicide more people than before since there are already people killing themselves will think of death as a simple way out of all their problems imagine the havoc someone can cause before simply going to a family doctor for a 5 dollar overdose of anesthetics and what if i redefine this suicide into murder another reliable source confirms that in a test of 1000 odd people more than 50 of the victims never actually opted for euthanasia themselves a very surprising 42 were euthanized without any input from their family as well do you not see the unfairness in euthanasia people are dying without even knowing why themselves doctors exerting their authority over life just because they think its best to put the person out wheres the justice in that when even something as precious as life is held in a syringe and they say euthanasia is supposed to save the person from all pain save him or her from the suffering saving saving indeed its murder q online gaming does not numb the mind on the contrary it sharpens the mind

2165429 saya abdul yang dulu bercita cita ingin jadi seorang pelukis yang hebat apakah bapak masih ingat
2165430 oh jadi kamu anak itu bagaimana lukisanmu sekarang apakah sudah berkembang
2165431 jadi bapak sudah lupa gara gara bapak mengatakan bahwa aku tidak berbakat di dunia lukis aku mengambil keputusan untuk tidak melukis lagi kalau bapak tidak mengatakannya dulu pasti saya sekarang sudah sukses dalam dunia lukis mengapa bapak mengatakan itu padaku
2165432 maafkan saya nak saya dulu sangat lelah karena telah 3 hari bekerja sekeras mungkin agar pamerannya berlangsung sukses sehingga ketika kamu memperlihatkan lukisanmu saya tidak benar benar memperhatikannya dan membandingkannya dengan apa yang saya lukis

2165531 jika jalan jalan ke aceh barat jangan lupa singgah sejenak di lamno jaya di sana dapat kita lihat dara portugis si dara barat yang biru mata
2165532 lihat saja keempat anak itu yang nomor dua dan nomor tiga berkulit putih rambutnya juga seperti bule matanya biru sementara anak tertua dan terbungsu persis seperti keturunan aceh asli kan
2165533 masalahnya adalah ketika kita masuk ke kampung kampung tempat keturunan portugis itu mereka lari entah mengapa mereka selalu menghindar saat hendak didata
2165534 sama dia saja kalian tanya kalau memang mau mendapatkan informasi lebih banyak tentang keturunan portugis
2165535 saya hanya memegang adat istiadat aceh sebagai pegangan saya di sini
2165536 hal ini sama saja dengan empat orang anak yang kalian katakan sudah melihatnya di desa leupe anak saya rauzatul jannah enam tahun dan nurul khamiran yang masih 2 5 tahun sangat mirip dengan orang barat tapi dua lagi yang tertuanya sangat kental dengan karakter orang aceh pada umumnya
2165537 mereka hanya malu masalah malu tidak jelas apakah karena mereka tidak mirip dengan orang aceh kebanyakan atau karena apa
2165538 orang orang keturunan portugis itu terkesan hanya mau bergaul dengan dia dia aja itu makanya susah menelusuri tentang mereka

2165544 i expected to see a much stronger side but the nigerian team played better
2165545 they depended too much on the likes of makaay babel and drenthe and they didnt look as strong as i thought they would be
2165546 i think they did well first games are always difficult especially when you play against a team like holland
2165547 they were just unlucky not to score if they had a bit more luck we would have won the game
2165548 the only thing a team needs in tournaments like this is the luck to score goals and i hope they can find it in their next games

2165639 mi novia baj tiempo despu s fu recibida por una lluvia de aplausos y su padre di un discurso olvidable sobre por qu usaba a su hija para sus propios intereses y sin tomar su opini n en cuenta
2165640 no hablamos mucho adem s de que no nos conoc amos el sal n estaba lleno de imb cibles cuyas manos sudorosas quer an pegarse a las m as sobre lara era muy pronto para formarme una opini n sobre ella pero hasta ahora no iba del todo mal
2165641 decid visitar los campos agr colas de vanderbilt a primera hora en la ma ana necesitaba un poco de tiempo con gente de verdad y para asegurarme de que se comportaran como tales me vest como un plebeyo pero a n as no estaban dispuestos a hablar conmigo estaban ocupados de una forma o de otra me sub a un rbol y me sent en una amp rama mientras miraba al cielo pensando en el problema en el que me hab a metido al poco tiempo not que lleg alguien y se sent a la sombra del rbol intent hablarle mientras volteaba la mirada al cielo otra vez
2165642 volte hacia donde yo estaba y volvi la vista al frente otra vez
2165643 y ahora sabes como se escribe no es que importe
2165644 si no lo hiciera por gusto no lo har a ya que no me sirve de nada siendo una esclava
2165645 la ltima vez que hice una afirmaci n no me dejaste terminar pens que te gustaban las preguntas
2165646 y se fu era bastante rara al parecer le gustaba sentarse a la sombra de los rboles y era tan molesta como yo pero tuve que conocerla m s para enamorarme al querer salir de ah me detuvo uno de los guardias
2165647 no puedes salir de aqu eres de los nuevos o qu
2165648 llegaron anoche eres de ese grupo verdad no me pareces conocido
2165649 si supongo que vanderbilt necesitaba m s esclavos nunca son suficientes qu tengo qu hacer
2165650 yo ten a unos 29 a os en aquel entonces y no conoc a una vida diferente desde siempre hab a sido la horrible agon a de trabajar todo el d a con pocos minutos libres cada 6 horas
2165651 esa ma ana conoc a alguien nuevo aunque no me interesaba en lo m s m nimo quien era pens que ser a interesante que se metiera en problemas siempre fu conocida por mi rebeld a ante las autoridades la cual era el resultado de mi inconformidad con mi forma de vida como sea sta pod a ser otra oportunidad para sacar otro poco de mi ira acumulada y reprimida lo encontr en los ba os una hora despu s
2165652 disculpe limpiar sus desperdicios no me da derecho a atacar su apariencia f sica con mis groser as
2165653 voy a tomar eso como una disculpa de verdad por tu bien
2165654 era un completo imb cil en m s de un sentido no entend a por qu era tan grosero aunque despu s me lo explic yo no cre ser as nunca pero me equivoqu se siente exactamente como me lo describi
2165655 me met en problemas con la mitad de la esclavizada comunidad en un par de horas era muy divertido en especial con los hombres por que no ten a que detenerme
2165656 uno de los nuevos se est metiendo en problemas con todos y noque a marshal
2165657 uno de mis hermanos no estaba dispuesta a soportarlo as que dej la cocina por un momento y fu a buscarlo
2165658 apunt a una de las casas cuando entr a ver encontr a mi padre y a mi hermano desmayados en el piso cuando comprob que no estaban muertos volv por venganza
2165659 qui n te crees vienes me insultas y luego golpeas a mi hermano y a mi padre es un viejo
2165660 no pod a evitarlo tratarlos como a ni os era demasiado tentador de hecho la nica diferencia entre un ni o y ellos era que los ni os no se lanzaban a atacarme cada vez que hablaba
2165661 hice lo de siempre lanz una cachetada y cuando quizo detenerme agarrando mi brazo lo jal hacia abajo recibiendo su est pida cara con mi rodilla
2165662 me di otros 3 rodillazos antes de darme la oportunidad de caer al piso ojal todos hubieran sido en la cara
2165663 voy a patearte el trasero todos los d as desde hoy hasta que muera tu nombre es mera formalidad
2165664 eso ya lo s pero con qui n ah el nuevo
2165665 se di la vuelta y se fu aunque lo que me preocupaba era la dificultad para respirar que me daba la sangre en mi nariz ten a una ligera inquietud de por qu una mujer sab a golpear de esa forma
2165666 cuando me levant a seguir con el trabajo que no deber a estar haciendo le pregunt a jacques sobre shazzia
2165667 oh ella no es el tipo de mujer con la que cualquiera se quiera meter incluso los guardias le temen y tienen armas
2165668 sus hermanos le ense aron pero los sobrepas despu s de un tiempo corr a el rumor de que ten a planeado escapar pero cuando los guardias se enteraron y fueron a buscarla para amenazarla ella ya se hab a ido
2165669 la atraparon una semana despu s nadie escapa del amo
2165670 parec a demasiado si de verdad fu tan h bil como para escapar por qu la hab an atrapado una semana despu s y no horas o un d a vanderbilt ir a tan lejos por una esclava problem tica como ella me hizo pensar que ten a algo de especial adem s de una mala actitud
2165671 no ha vuelto a intentarlo desde entonces es una loca pero es buena persona
2165672 tal vez lo hubiera notado si no hubiera tenido su rodilla en la cara
2165673 y no hubieras tenido su rodilla en tu cara si hubieras dejado consciente a su familia
2165674 te defend por que no quer a que te golpearan pero fuiste muy hiriente y no te dieron raz n para que lo fueras
2165675 jacques me ayud a bajarme del pedestal en el que estaba aunque no era muy brillante sab a que decir en cada situaci n
2165676 nunca supimos que era pero lo mordi y estuvo enfermo una semana
2165677 al atardecer fu a sentarme a la sombra de mi rbol favorito por unos minutos mi padre y mi hermano estaban bien fu solo el dolor de cuello que se pasar a r pido
2165678 entendiste lo que dije o reaccionaste al sonido de mi voz
2165679 entonces sabes que mereces lo que te voy a hacer
2165680 est s llena de rencor es por que frustraron tu escape
2165681 jacques si lo dijo no creo que sea un secreto
2165682 mira vine a pedir disculpas por que no me vas a volver a ver puedes decirle a tu padre y hermano que lo siento por m si me ven van a intentar golpearme otra vez
2165683 corr y salt la barda sin mucho problema aunque shazzia alert a los guardias no pudieron seguirme la pista por mucho tiempo cuando llegu a mi mansi n pude darme por salvado
2165684 no te preocupes marge estoy bien s lo fui a jugar por ah
2165685 el se or vanderbilt vino a buscarlo se ve a molesto por que usted no estaba y dijo que su padre se enterar a de sto
2165686 los ricos est n locos marge t debes saberlo mejor que yo
2165687 le dec a marge para abreviar margaretha noir era la mejor sirvienta que cualquiera pod a tener adem s de hacer su trabajo su preocupaci n por m era genuina
2165688 el tipo de vida que me toc no me lo permiti amo
2165689 no se preocupe amo no es su culpa es la vida que me toc vivir
2165690 por qu es tan injusto por qu la vida es tan injusta
2165691 no creo que la vida sea injusta m s bien creo que nos prepara cumplir nuestros prop sitos en el mundo
2165692 de qu est s hablando dices que ser feliz no te sirve de nada para tu prop sito en el mundo
2165693 no hay d a que no agradezca que usted sea mi amo todos los que trabajamos para usted estamos muy agradecidos no s lo nos trata como seres humanos es casi como si nos considerara sus iguales mi vida es la de una sirvienta pero me toc el mejor escenario posible para una sirvienta gracias
2165694 nunca fu bueno para expresar sentimientos y me avergonzaba que me dijeran mis virtudes as que no respond mucho
2165695 voy a estar bien ya s lo duele cuando respiro
2165696 fu por un m dico para que me tratara y lleg poco despu s de que termin de ba arme el tipo no hizo nada impresionante pero fu un alivio despu s de todo
2165697 marge toc bastante fuerte la puerta de mi cuarto muy temprano en la ma ana despert pregunt ndome por qu estar a tan desesperada pero me qued tall ndome los ojos me llam un par de veces antes de que la puerta se abriera bruscamente era vanderbilt

2165707 fu cuando empez a sospechar por lo menos se di una idea general sab a que algo pasaba pero estoy seguro de que nunca hubiera adivinado que era exactamente nadie en el mundo lo hubiera imaginado
2165708 llegamos a su hacienda y hab a mucha gente pero no les prest atenci n por que se ve an bien vestidos as que me dirig a un cuarto para cambiarme con el traje que hab a llevado cuando sal me d cuenta de que la mayor a de la gente que transitaba por la casa estaba uniformada y de alguna forma me las hab a arreglado para elegir un traje que era casi id ntico

2165719 entonces decide a qui n le temes m s a shazzia o a m
2165720 marco era el m s amable de los guardias pero se daba a respetar en cierta forma y aunque sab a que no pod a meterme en problemas con vanderbilt decid no revelarme como noble a n y si era posible nunca pero sa no era una opci n
2165721 escuchen todas el nuevo les va a ayudar con lo que ninguna de ustedes quiera hacer
2165722 se fu despu s de decir eso dej ndome con las miradas de unas 14 mujeres sobre m s que hago que suene como si no hubiera sido tan inc modo como lo fu y tal vez hubiera ayudado que shazzia no me hubiera mirado con esa cara de

2165726 y c mo ibas a saber t eso sta es una receta familiar
2165727 so no es cierto alguien que conoc hace mucho lo preparaba
2165728 no puede ser a ver dime cu l era su nombre
2165729 obviamente no es la misma persona de quien yo estoy hablando muri asesinada
2165730 te suena conocido no puedo creerlo c mo s bes eso
2165731 fu al ba o e intent quedarme el mayor tiempo posible ah pens que podr a escabullirme de alguna forma llendo a otro lugar o buscando a vanderbilt pero al salir shazzia est ba esper ndome

2165733 de alguna forma me las arregl para verme 70 a os m s j ven
2165734 de d nde sacas eso crees que me lo voy a creer
2165735 claro que no no se puede enga ar a los ni os lo cu l eres para m
2165736 est bien mi abuela contaba historias de su juventud todo el tiempo sobre todo la parte que no obiaba te suena un hospital en el que trabaj
2165737 no trabajaba cuando la conoc ten amos unos 16 en aqul tiempo viv amos en lo que se podr a llamar un refugio era una casa normal s lo que no viv amos con ninguna supervisi n adulta
2165738 kazi lo llam jefe pero la primera vez que lo v los reban a todos
2165739 lo cual significa que tu eres uno zien o xin cierto
2165740 se dirigi a la cocina inmediatamente despu s de decir eso como not algo extra o en su conducta se lo pregunt inmediatamente
2165741 c llate si lo pr ximo que sale de tu boca no es tu nombre no me interesa nada de lo que tengas que decir
2165742 sigui con su camino mientras yo tomaba la direcci n opuesta me encontr con vanderbilt poco despu s quien se quejaba de lo mucho que me hab a buscado y me preguntaba por qu me hab a vestido como la servidumbre
2165743 me llev a cambiarme de ropas en uno de los cuartos y luego a la mesa de los invitados de honor en el gr n sal n donde estaba lara
2165744 dijo mientras volteaba hacia una de las enormes ventanas con una cara de preocupaci n s lo para ver el sol siendo tapado por las cortinas en lugar de nubes grises fu entonces cuando su mirada incr dula volvi a mis ojos
2165745 mi instructora de modales me dijo que si la gente dijera lo que piensa ya no habr a raza humana a quien ense ar modales
2165746 por tanto tienes que actuar conforme a la voluntad de los dem s
2165747 es una forma de evitar el conflicto si ambos tuvi ramos un car cter dominante no tendr amos muchos momentos de paz
2165748 pasaron un par de horas bailamos y hablamos un poco m s hasta que lleg la comida y pasamos a tomar asiento de nuevo a shazzia le toc servir a nuestra mesa parec a no interesarle a qui n le serv a los platos hasta que escuch mi voz y volte a verme
2165749 ziro que est pasando por qu pareciera que la conoce como si fueran amigos
2165750 buen trabajo ahora dinos de que color es la mesa
2165751 en ese momento lleg vanderbilt extra ado y atra do por la discusi n
2165752 a decir verdad actu bastante violenta al responderle parec a que la iba a golpear as que me levante para evitar algo inesperado
2165753 los guardias la sometieron pronto supongo que no quizo causar m s problemas por que con su habilidad bien pudo haberlos sometido a ellos
2165754 nadie es imprescindible se la llevaron y la noche sigui sin m s incidentes
2165755 me pas la ma ana muy ocupado prepar ndome era el gran d a despu s de todo y a decir verdad era mucho m s normal que los d as anteriores llegu al altar y mi novia lleg tarde como esperaba la ceremonia transcurri normalmente hasta aqu l momento
2165756 quien considere que las vidas de stas dos personas no deban unirse en sagrado matrimonio que hable ahora o calle para siempre
2165757 en ese momento se escucharon ruidos extra os a lo lejos que distrajeron a los asistentes como de una pelea para cuando los guardias abrieron las enormes puertas de hierro que nos separaban del mundo exterior los ruidos hab an terminado con gemidos abruptos que yo conoc a bien ah estaba shazzia con las manos atadas a la espalda y un pedazo de lanza en ellas manchada de sangre por todos lados y tres cuerpos yaciendo a sus pies uno de los cu les a n se mov a y ped a auxilio corri con prisa hacia el altar con sus ojos llenos de odio no quitaba su mirada de m mientras se acercaba pero se detuvo a unos metros de m para decir unas palabras mientras jadeaba
2165758 me halagas mataste gente para evitar que me case con otra persona
2165759 mat a esa gente para llegar hasta aqu y matarte a t
2165760 in all that would be a pay rise of 5 5 percent
2165761 we cannot understand why the pilots have now decided to strike
2165762 to find the secret word look near a lively game pointing to the path with a rabbit in its name
2165763 pointing to the path with a rabbit in its name
2165764 is there anyone in the audience who knows what that may be
2165765 the red sox fell apart in front of everyones eyes losing a 14 game lead which is now 3 games and are about to lose that
2165766 red sox are going to be in the post season but just because of a great start
2165767 the tribal gift economy proved that individuals could successfully live together without needing either the state or market
2165768 self interest of net users perpetuates this hi tech gift economy
2165769 however in their californian ideologies ideals of youth will now be realized through technological determinism and free markets the politics of ecstasy replaced by politics of greed
2165770 instead of following the intellectual elite everyone should instead determine their own destinies
2165771 there could be no compromise between tribal authenticity and bourgeois alienation after the social revolution the potlatch would completely supplant the commodity
2165772 during the late 70s pro situ attitudes were further popularized by the punk movement the spirit of may 68 lives on the gift is supposedly about to replace the commodity
2165773 technically every act within cyberspace involves copying material from one computer to another
2165774 the design of the net therefore assumes that intellectual property is technically and socially obsolete
2165775 microsofts biggest competitor in the provision of web servers comes from the apache program
2165776 your smart snacking weapon fills you up wont fill you out
2165777 a primary component of the super network which would eventually become the internet
2165778 when vinct cerf and bob khan defined the transmission control protocol tcp and the internet protocol ip
2165779 too much of a hassle for a non computer expert
2165780 the first stage popular cyber culture marked by its journalistic origins and characterized by its descriptive nature limited dualism and use of the internet as frontier metaphor the second stage cyber culture studies focuses largely on virtual communities and online identities and benefits from an influx of academic scholars the third stage critical cyber culture studies expands the notion of cyber culture to include four areas of study online interactions digital discourses access and denial to the internet and interface design of cyberspace and explores the intersections and interdependencies between any and all four domains

2165784 agora eu posso escrever uma coisa nova que eu nunca fiz mas que acho que dou conta que escrever contos com at 150 caracteres para que caibam numa mensagem sms torpedo de celular isso eu me comprometo a fazer acho que sou bastante louco para ter uma produ o
2165785 chega de escrever microcontos uma hora que eu tiver paci ncia volto a escrever mais
2165786 p voc mexe com tecnologia trabalha com projetos de inclus o digital e escreve haicais vamos fazer uma oficina de haicais e coisas eletr nicas
2165787 na na ni na n o assim n o consigo
2165788 ah o haicai muito legal mas uma brincadeira que nem o cara ser um pintor e fazer um quadro na cabe a de uma agulha um desafio
2165789 venho por meio desta solicitar lhe um recept culo cheio de gua a fim de que satisfa a
2165790 se houvesse software na poca em que eu fazia experi ncias com lsd eu teria preferido fazer com software porque d muito mais barato
2165791 pode mas o pre o voc me mandar a produ o dos pacientes
2165792 jo ozinho a primeira quest o est certa mas voc foi muito lac nico pe o que voc reconsidere e aprofunde um pouco mais a resposta a segunda est totalmente errada voc deve pesquisar melhor a terceira est muito boa at pe o licen a para us la em minhas aulas futuras

2165794 oi querida voc ainda gosta de mim desligue amanh ligo de novo
2165795 achei engra ado toda a vez que eu olhava para um detalhe o filme parava e mostrava mais parecia que ele estava acompanhando o que eu pensava
2165796 olha essa receita de bolo de fub parecida com a minha
2165797 mas clotilde onde voc pegou essa receita na internet n o acredito aquela coisa da novela aquela coisa que o meu neto usa
2165798 ah mas eu tenho uma receita muito melhor do que essa quero coloc la na internet
2165799 voc quer saber o valor em bits ou em tomos porque em tomos vale quatro mil d lares mas em bits tem aqui uns quarenta mil d lares
2165800 tudo bem que o chat um mundo de mentira em que voc o que quer ser por m o faz de conta importante para a aprendizagem quando desenvolvemos esses novos personagens entramos em contato com o nosso interior nosso jeito de pensar e assim nos conhecemos melhor preciso aproveitar isso como estrat gia de ensino
2165801 quando paramos para perceber esse trabalho o aluno j estudou ao mesmo tempo ci ncias meio ambiente hist ria matem tica e portugu s ele tamb m pode estudar gram tica quando desenvolve jornais para a escola escreve poesias para publicar no espa o virtual da sala as viv ncias se tornam mais ricas no processo de aprendizado
2165802 os professores s v em a gram tica de seus alunos na hora da prova na internet voc o que escreve o aluno n o vai querer que um mundo de gente pense que ele n o sabe escrever por isso ao redigir um e mail divulgar seus trabalhos num site ou postar num blog vai prestar mais aten o quanto gram tica
2165803 concordo com os professores que deprimente ver certas linguagens utilizadas na web por m n o significa que os alunos n o sejam inteligentes quando escrevem vc ao inv s de voc ou naum ao inv s de n o esse um processo de comunica o tribal que facilita a comunica o entre os indiv duos
2165804 torna mais dif cil o papel do professor que tem que se interar e saber tornar mais atraente a aula em que utiliza o computador ou a desinteressante lousa com giz branco mas claro que como em todo desafio tr s vantagens de crescimento positivo observar como os recursos da internet se bem utilizados no ambiente escolar geram intera o e aproxima o no relacionamento professor aluno a tecnologia nos possibilita descobrir sujeitos talentosos como poetas e ainda disponibilizar uma poesia de algu m famoso a qual poucas pessoas teriam acesso anteriormente
2165805 um deles agu ar o aluno para o uso do intelecto perante as facilidades trazidas pela internet outro utilizar novos m todos de ensino como a transdisciplinaridade o professor quando opta por isso vai contra o padr o do curr culo escolar contra os pais que acham que os filhos n o est o sendo preparados para o vestibular os professores t m que estar preparados para mudar a escola e as tecnologias digitais e multim dia colaboram para que isso seja feito
2165806 as id ias do wiki podem parecer estranhas primeira vista mas mergulhe e explore seus links wiki um sistema de composi o um meio de discuss o um dep sito um sistema de correspond ncia uma ferramenta de colabora o na verdade temos dificuldade em defini lo mas uma forma divertida para se comunicar de forma ass ncrona pela rede

2165829 in the first place we should insist that if the immigrant who comes here in good faith becomes an american and assimilates himself to us he shall be treated on an exact equality with everyone else for it is an outrage to discriminate against any such man because of creed or birthplace or origin
2165830 but this is predicated upon the persons becoming in every facet an american and nothing but an american there can be no divided allegiance here any man who says he is an american but something else also isnt an american at all
2165831 we have room for but one flag the american flag we have room for but one language here and that is the english language and we have room for but one sole loyalty and that is a loyalty to the american people

2165840 he has not brought in many new players but he has changed a lot of things and the players are happy with that
2165841 he played against ghana in the 2006 world cup qualifier and was impressive i also think that the fact he is coming from a well known side like kaizer chiefs suggest he will add a lot of experience to the team

2165876 jika kalian telah berjual beli dengan sistem baiul iinah dan kalian telah memegang ekor ekor sapi dan ridha dengan pekerjaan bertani serta meninggalkan jihad dijalan allah niscaya allah akan menjadikan kehinaan menguasai kalian dia tidak akan mencabutnya dari kalian hingga kalian kembali kepada agama kalian
2165877 jagalah lisanmu janganlah engkau mengghibah ngrasani saudaramu sendiri sesama muslim bukankah allah berfirman janganlah sebagian kamu menghibah menggunjing sebagian yang lain sukakah salah seorang diantara kamu memakan daging saudaranya yang sudah mati
2165878 ketahuilah bahwa ghibah dibolehkan untuk tujuan yang benar dan disyariatkan yang tidak mungkin tujuan itu tercapai kecuali dengan ghibah tersebut hal ini ada dalam enam perkara
2165879 bahwa ada seorang yang meminta ijin untuk menemui nabi shallallahu alaihi wa sallam maka beliau mengatakan ijinkanlah dia dia adalah sejelek jeleknya kerabat
2165880 aku kira fulan dan fulan itu tidak mengetahui sesuatupun dari agama kita
2165881 adapun muawiyah dia itu miskin tidak punya harta dan adapun abu jahm maka dia itu tidak pernah menaruh tongkat dari pundaknya
2165882 ambillah apa yang mencukupimu dan anak anakmu dengan cara yang baik
2165883 imam nawawi rahimahullah menyebutkan dalam bab ini hal hal yang dibolehkan ghibah didalamnya yaitu ada enam perkara ucapan beliau ini sangat baik sekali semuanya benar dan baik
2165884 senantiasa ahlus sunnah mencela ahlul ahwa bidah yang menyesatkan umat mereka melarang bermajlis dengan ahli bidah mengkhawatirkan fitnah mereka serta menjelaskan balasan mereka ahlussunnah tidak menganggap hal tersebut sebagai suatu ghibah
2165885 sebagian orang yang tidak paham akan agama ini mencela para ahli hadits dalam ucapan mereka tentang perawi perawi hadits sungguh kita telah mendapati banyak dari para imam dari kalangan tabiin membicarakan menggunjing mencela para perowi diantara mereka adalah hasan al bashri amp thowus mereka berdua mencela mabad al juhani said bin jubeir membicarakan tholq bin habib ibrahim dan amir membicarakan a l harits demikian pula yang diriwayatkan dari ayyub as sakhtiyani abdullah bin aun sulaiman at taimi syubah bin hajjaj sufyan ats tsauri malik bin anas al auzai abdullah bin mubarak yahya bin said al qoththon waki bin jarrah abdurrohman bin mahdi dan selain mereka dari para ahli ilmu mereka semua pernah membicarakan para perawi perawi dan mendhoifkannya tidaklah yang mendorong mereka dalam hal ini membicarakan menghibah para perawi melainkan untuk menasehati kaum muslimin tidak mungkin mereka hanya ingin mencela dan menghibah saja akan tetapi mereka ingin menjelaskan kelemahan para perawi tersebut agar diketahui kaum muslimin karena sebagian perawi yang lemah tersebut adalah ahli bidah sebagian lagi tertuduh memalsukan hadits dan sebagian lagi ada yang banyak kesalahannya maka para imam imam tersebut ingin menjelaskan hakekat mereka para perawi dengan sebenarnya dalam rangka menjaga agama ini dan menjelaskan hakekat sebenarnya karena persaksian dalam agama tentang hadits pent lebih utama untuk diteliti dari pada persaksian dalam masalah hak pribadi dan harta
2165886 disini imam tirmidzi ingin menjelaskan bahwa membicarakan mengunjing para perowi jarh wa tadil itu boleh hal ini telah disepakati oleh para salaf pendahulu umat ini dan para imam imam mereka demikian itu untuk membedakan mana perowi hadits yang bisa diterima dan mana yang tidak sebagian orang yang tidak memiliki ilmu mengira itu adalah ghibah yang diharamkan padahal tidak demikian sebab membicarakan aib seseorang jika ada maslahatnya meskipun pribadi dibolehkan dalam agama tanpa ada perselisihan lagi seperti mencela para saksi yang dusta maka kalau maslahatnya umum untuk muslimin ini lebih dibolehkan lagi
2165887 aku merasa berat jika mengatakan si fulan itu demikian dan demikian dari kesesatannya pent
2165888 jika engkau diam dan akupun juga diam maka kapan orang bodoh awam tahu mana yang benar dan mana yang salah
2165889 ada seseorang yang puasa sholat itikaf dan ada orang lain yang membantah ahli bidah manakah yang lebih anda sukai
2165890 tiga golongan manusia yang tidak ada larangan dalam mengghibah mereka salah satunya adalah ahli bidah yang extrim dalam bidahnya
2165891 tidak ada istilah ghibah dalam mencela pelaku bidah dan orang fasik yang menampakkan kefasikannya
2165892 pengekor hawa nafsu dalam agama ini tidak ada larangan dalam mengghibahnya
2165893 ketahuilah bahwa ghibah itu dibolehkan selama untuk tujuan yang disyariatkan yang tidak mungkin sampai kepadanya kecuali dengan ghibah tersebut maka tidak ada dosa didalamnya hal tersebut ada pada 6 keadaan
2165894 hai orang orang yang beriman keluarkanlah sebagian hasil usaha yang kalian peroleh dan sebagian hasil bumi yang kami keluarkan untuk kalian
2165895 kemudian rasulullah saw memerintahkan agar kami mengeluarkan zakat dari barang barang yang kami maksudkan untuk dijual
2165896 aku bertugas di baitul mal pada masa umar bin khaththab apabila para pedagang mengeluarkan harta perdagangannya maka dilakukan perhitungan baik yang sudah ada maupun yang masih gaib kemudian diambil zakatnya dari harta yang sudah ada maupun yang gaib dengan menggunakan harta yang sudah ada

2165898 ya allah berikanlah kepada saya taufik untuk bisa menghafal al quran dan berilah saya kekuatan untuk terus membacanya siang dan malam sesuai dengan ridhal dan tuntunan mu wahai yang maha pengasih

2165900 sesungguhnya agama ini mudah dan tidak ada yang mempersulit diri dalam agama ini kecuali dia akan capai sendiri makanya amalkan agama ini dengan benar pelan pelan dan berilah kabar gembira serta gunakan waktu pagi siang dan malam untuk mengerjakannya
2165901 cognitive dissonance describes the uncomfortable tension that comes from holding two conflicting thoughts at the same time
2165902 for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus will god bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the archangel and with the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up greek harpazo together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the lord
2165903 1 to seize carry off by force 2 to seize on claim for ones self eagerly or 3 to snatch out or away
2165904 i knew a man in christ above fourteen years ago whether in the body i cannot tell or whether out of the body i cannot tell god knoweth such an one caught up harpazo to the third heaven how that he was caught up harpazo into paradise and heard unspeakable words which it is not lawful for a man to utter
2165905 and she brought forth a man child who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up harpazo unto god and to his throne
2165906 after these things jesus shewed himself again to the disciples at the sea of tiberias
2165907 let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god
2165908 1 the act of seizing robbery 2 a thing seized or to be seized a booty to deem anything a prize or b a thing to be seized upon or to be held fast retained

2165911 the blessings of your father have excelled the blessings of my ancestors up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers
2165912 the blessings of your father have surpassed the blessings of my ancestors up to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills may they be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of the one distinguished among his brothers
2165913 thy fathers blessings have been mighty above the blessings of my progenitors unto the limit of the heights age during they are for the head of joseph and for the crown of the one separate from his brethren
2165914 the blessings of thy father surpass the blessings of my ancestors unto the bounds of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separated from his brethren

2165918 the time is apparently at hand when the market for european industry will not only cease its further expansion but will even begin to shrink this event can only mean the bankruptcy of the entire capitalist society
2165919 the basis thus given for the inevitability of the collapse of capitalist society allots the chief role to the contradiction between the constant drive to expand production and the ever slower expansion of the market and finally its shrinkage it is this contradiction according to kautsky that must bring about the collapse of the capitalist system of society but listen well the expansion of production presumes the productive consumption of part of the surplus value i e first its realisation and then its expenditure on machinery buildings etc for new production in other words the expansion of production is most closely connected with the existence of a market for the commodities already produced the constant expansion of production with a market that is relatively shrinking is therefore an impossibility
2165920 the ultimate cause of all real crises is the poverty and limited consumption of the masses
2165921 the artisan has been almost deprived of his roots in the modern economic system whereas the peasant continues to stand firm in it
2165922 the development of capitalist relations in the manufacturing industry ruins the artisan but improves the condition of the peasant it the condition i hinders the penetration of capitalism into agriculture
2165923 on the other hand the development of the manufacturing industry ensures subsidiary earnings for the peasant
2165924 the sap of life has not yet left the peasant class
2165925 adopted a resolution sympathising with the organisation of producers associations
2165926 to conduct a particular struggle against the belief that associations are in a position to bring any influence to bear on capitalist production relations etc
2165927 we should be acting superficially if we undertook to criticise this whole conception of the working class movement from the stand point of its conformity to the true course taken by the development of this movement from the standpoint of its scientific basis mr prokopovichs italics there is not and can not be sic a grain of science in it
2165928 of which there cannot be even a grain in the theory that is dominant in germany or or how can it be put delicately
2165929 only when it is admitted that it must serve the aims of a party and not define them it must be recognised that science cannot define the aims of a practical party
2165930 a principled programme inevitably leads to dogmatism and is only a hindrance in the way of the partys sound development theoretical principles are all very well in propaganda but not in a programme
2165931 the individual himself may be a programme if he is sensitive to and has a fine feeling for the needs of the times
2165932 not in any way violating ones independence loyalty to principle
2165933 i renounce compromise only in the case in which it leads to a renunciation of principles or even to the ignoring of principles
2165934 not of course selling ones soul in the present case ones principles
2165935 a compass is needed that would rid us of the need to grope our way
2165936 if german social democracy were the expression of socialism and not of the proletariat that is acting in defence of its own interests in present day society for the first time recognising its significance then since not all germans are idealists side by side with this party that pursues idealist aims we should see another stronger party a working class party that represents the practical interests of that part of the german proletariat that is not idealist
2165937 if socialism were not to play the role of a mere symbol in that movement a symbol distinguishing one definite organisation if it were the motive idea the principle that demands of party members a certain specific service in that case the socialist party would separate from the general labour party and the mass of the proletariat which strives for better living conditions under the existing system and cares little for the ideal future would form an independent labour party

2165947 i know that i probably dont know half as much his manager but that just seemed mean
2165948 call it a mothers intuition but i think brandy didnt want to be in that game anymore
2165949 when he got that tall gentleman to hit the ball in the air to one of his guys out there in the grass i finally took a breath
2165950 i even put down his teddy bear wendy that he always cuddled with whenever he wet the bed
2165951 when the man on the tv told me that the man holding the bat in front of that man who crouches was the pitcher i knew that was trouble
2165952 see even though my brandy is a thrower he likes to do all that hitting and running and sliding let me tell you if i had a nickel for ever stitch i had put in that boys ripped britches over the years well anyways i was afraid this boy holding the bat on the tv in front of the man who crouches liked to do all that hitting and running and sliding too
2165953 when he got that short fella to hit the ball to him i was so relieved
2165954 brandy has had some trouble on occasion when hes throwing i was just happy that it was finally over
2165955 that is the part that gets me hotter than a whore in church
2165956 i mean i know he likes the hitting but he had given up all them runs when he was throwing and they were fixing to have a chance to have some of their own players touch that plate in front of where that man crouches so why make brandy hit
2165957 after the third inning we just said we need you to stay in as long as you can go
2165958 i just couldnt believe he sent brandy back out there
2165959 when he called i told him sugar it cant go much worse than that

2165970 it was an emotional game and the scoreline kept jumping about from us to bolton
2165971 when it went to 2 2 they sat back and fought for everything there were perhaps too many emotions for us in the game but we still played with a lot of heart and the players gave everything to try and win the game
2165972 united are in a much better situation but we know if we take nine points from our last three games and united lose six points then well be okay its not easy to lose six points but anything is possible in football
2165973 we have to keep believing its part of our position as current champions but the reality is it is much more difficult for us to win the title now the lads are sad and frustrated with the result but as champions we have to believe and give everything until the end of the season
2165974 theres a chance that we will concede over there so we have to score and we will be going over there with an attitude to score
2165975 away from home against benfica and lille we have picked up 1 0 results without being brilliant but we need to really play well in milan and have a goal threat about us
2165976 what we have got to do is crossing the line like we did against juventus in 1999 when we needed to go there and get a result
2165977 milan have got a richer european history but we have got a great history also i think it could be any score i really do
2165978 in the first leg even at 2 1 i still fancied us i thought at half time we had a chance
2165979 when you see the goals we lost they were poor goals to concede but we had something to cling to we were creating chances i said to the players if youre conceding goals like that what chance are you giving yourselves
2165980 but i thought the quality of our football in the first half was good we were making chances and there was a momentum to our game i felt that the longer that went on the better it would get
2165981 i wouldnt say we are favorites but we have given ourselves a great chance
2165982 a goal lead is a great start in european football but we also have a good counter attacking capability in our team with our speed on the break
2165983 i just expect people to know about these kinds of things
2165984 while that may be true money can buy you a jet ski and have you ever seen someone unhappy on a jet ski

2166022 i think that under the glare of the olympic spotlight we can see areas where china has taken small steps forward particularly in relation to their commitment on media freedom
2166023 i think that the important thing now is not just that things get smartened up and more acceptable for the olympics but this is an opportunity for china to say to the rest of the world we were privileged by having the olympics and we as a country are going to begin change that will last well beyond the olympics
2166024 this is why i think international dialogue has got to continue after the olympics perhaps the intensity of concern about issues in relation to tibet human rights in china media freedom particularly media freedom for chinese journalists not just western journalists is something it is important we all continue to pursue in dialogue with the chinese government
2166025 i want to wish you every luck and success in these olympic games you represent the very best of our great country and your dedication skill and courage are an inspiration to millions of us the whole country is behind you and we are looking forward to a fantastic festival of sport over the next two weeks good luck

2166344 tiene previsto el gobierno recuperar el proyecto de la l nea de alta tensi n arag n cazaril para aumentar la conexi n el ctrica con francia por el pirineo aragon s
2166345 es objetivo del gobierno incrementar en m s de 4 000mw la potencia de interconexi n con francia recomendada por la uni n europea por lo cual no se descarta ninguna alternativa de cruce de alguna l nea el ctrica a trav s de los pirineos adem s de las l neas sentmenat bescar francia por el pirineo oriental y hernani cantegrit por el pirineo occidental
2166346 qu previsiones tiene el gobierno respecto a la l nea el ctrica denominada
2166347 la conexi n el ctrica con francia atravesando el pirineo aragon s ha sido desde hace d cadas un proyecto que ha estado siempre como una

2166349 las afecciones que dicha instalaci n habr an de producir supondr an perjuicios graves e irreparables en masas forestales paisajes y en espacios de gran pureza calidad y belleza donde tienen su h bitat especies de excepcional inter s protegidas y en peligro de extinci n para los que la l nea el ctrica representa un gran riesgo por otra parte su incidencia negativa en la monta a afecta tambi n a las condiciones de vida y a las expectativas de desarrollo sostenible de sus habitantes
2166350 el gobierno considera necesario ampliar las conexiones con francia pero que descarta la conexi n arag n cazaril
2166351 se or a el gobierno considera que es muy importante incrementar la capacidad de interconexi n el ctrica de nuestro pa s esta es una evidencia que adem s ha sido reconocida por parte de todos los grupos pol ticos de esta c mara y tambi n del senado en diversas ocasiones nuestro nivel de interconexi n con francia en estos momentos es muy bajo solo estamos al 3 por ciento hay que tener en cuenta que con portugal estamos al 12 por ciento que italia con francia est al 12 13 por ciento y que espa a con marruecos est al 20 por ciento por tanto la interconexi n de espa a con francia es muy escasa no es buena para la garant a de suministro el ctrico en nuestro pa s ni para la seguridad en nuestra red por lo cual hay un fuerte compromiso de nuestro gobierno para incrementar la conexi n con la red europea en estos momentos los proyectos que estamos estudiando para esta interconexi n no pasan por el proyecto de arag n cazaril por lo tanto por parte del gobierno no hay ning n proyecto de rehabilitar ni de sacar el proyecto de los cajones ni nada parecido en estos momentos el proyecto pasa por una conexi n en el pirineo oriental y en todo caso por el reforzamiento menor de algunas conexiones menores y no por el establecimiento de nuevas l neas de interconexi n le digo esto para que quede constancia y para que todos tengamos claro cu l es la situaci n en primer lugar hay que incrementar las conexiones con francia de esto depende la seguridad de nuestro sistema y de que nuestra energ a e lica por ejemplo pueda ser aprovechada hasta sus ltimos kilovatios por lo tanto en nuestra pol tica de renovables es muy importante esta interconexi n con francia y tambi n quiero afirmarle insisto que esta interconexi n hoy por hoy no pasa por el proyecto de arag n cazaril

2166428 despert aquella noche en un cuarto muy conocido despu s de tantos a os hab a vuelto al refugio en el que auron los mat a todos s lo quedamos xin y yo aquel d a
2166429 en ese momento s lo sab a que era de noche no me interesaba de todas formas hac a a os que hab a perdido la noci n del tiempo dorm a una o dos horas en cualquier oportunidad
2166430 mientras me preparaba para partir del lugar una de las monjas me abord el lugar se hab a convertido en un verdadero refugio para hu rfanos de la iglesia local y hab a perdido la clandestinidad que tanto me gustaba as que no estaba seguro ah por mucho tiempo tampoco en mi pueblo natal pero hac a mucho que estaba fuera de casa
2166431 a mi pueblo natal hace mucho que no voy para all
2166432 al no ser mi nombre verdadero la bendici n no me lleg y de verdad la necesitaba part a mi pueblo entonces despu s de 30 a os no pod a esperar para ver c mo estaban todos
2166433 llegu a pole al amanecer de ese d a esperando que nadie me recordara la recompensa sobre mi cabeza segu a ah aunque hac a 23 a os que el rey hab a sido derrocado era por que xin se hab a encargado de eso
2166434 como esperaba era un extra o para todos nadie recordaba al hijo m s menospreciado de los kou me daba la impresi n de que me encontrar a a maria o a stain en cualquier momento de verdad quer a verlos pero mucha gente a n no despertaba decid dar un paseo
2166435 despu s de un par de horas de dar vueltas llegu a la puerta de mi antigua casa era muy diferente a como la recordaba como la mayor a de las cosas en el pueblo me preguntaba si algunos de mis hermanos o incluso mis padres segu an viviendo ah pero era la edad media la gente no duraba muchos a os con vida quer a decirle a mi padre algo como viaj por el mundo y forj mi car cter mientras mi madre golpeaba con su escoba en medio de gritos al extra o que invad a su casa deseaba tanto el escenario tan familiar
2166436 al abrir la puerta me qued muy sorprendido estaba toda la familia desayunando en la mesa se me quedaron viendo en silencio mientras entraba y levantaba unas tablas y entraba en el hoyo en el suelo
2166437 no era mi familia pobre gente se asustaron dej mi equipaje en el suelo reci n encend a la veladora cuando el padre de familia levant las tablas
2166438 no voy a molestarlos es s lo que viv a aqu hace unos a os y no tengo donde quedarme
2166439 no era la persona m s razonable que el universo pod a ofrecer pero decid intentar llegar a un acuerdo
2166440 d jeme en paz y no le patear el trasero frente a su familia
2166441 l rgate y no te mato soy un ex guerrero de la guardia real polaca divisi n de lite
2166442 soy zien t kou asesino serial y criminal buscado en todos los pa ses
2166443 voy a dejar mis cosas ah abajo si las tocan les dar una muestra de mis habilidades y no quieren eso
2166444 sal de ah despu s de tapar el hoyo me dirig a donde estaba el rbol donde pas la mayor parte de mi ni ez un lugar alejado de las casas y donde corr a el aire como en ning n lugar donde maria se me declar
2166445 me sent a la sombra del rbol a descansar sent a que xin no llegar a ah en un tiempo aunque ya hab a dado mi nombre a una familia local quer a dormir un rato pero apenas hab a cerrado los ojos y escuch una voz que dec a mi nombre
2166446 eso ya lo s pero no esperaba que me reconociera
2166447 por qu me hablas tan formalmente somos amigos o no
2166448 la v a los ojos y no pod a apartar la vista ni articular palabra tal vez sent a algo por ella pero era imposible que fuera soltera a n hablamos mucho rato hasta que dijo lo que esperaba
2166449 me estremec con esas palabras pero no pod a hacer nada ya
2166450 hasta ahora las muertes de toda la gente que he querido hab an sido violentas me culpas por alegrarme de que esta vez no fu as
2166451 los dos mayores fueron reclutados por el rey los dem s se fueron despu s de la muerte de tus padres uno por uno
2166452 no la vendieron la familia que vive ah estaba inconforme en donde viv an y se mudaron cuando tu casa se qued sola
2166453 que poca verg enza correrme as despu s de que la casa ni si quiera es suya bueno supongo que es comprensible
2166454 con que aqu est bas mujer que est s haciendo con otro hombre
2166455 cu ntas horas crees que has estado aqu eh eh
2166456 no pod a soportar tal espect culo as que por mucho que fuera mi amigo de la infancia me levant y le d el golpe de su vida en el ojo izquierdo asegur ndome de que le doliera como ninguna otra cosa luego lo tom del brazo y con fuerza lo estrell contra el viejo rbol
2166457 no te dej el camino libre con maria para que la trates de esa forma si te vuelvo a ver haci ndo eso te patear el trasero
2166458 como toda mujer sumisa se pon a del lado de su marido sin importar que estaba domada era como un perro fiel se fueron despu s de eso no hab a mucho para m en ese lugar lo cu l lo hac a exactamente igual a cualquier lugar del plano mundo
2166459 volv a casa al atardecer al abrir la puerta estaba el padre de familia vestido de guardia con su arma incluso y listo para atacarme por el bien de su familia
2166460 ramos testarudos y no bamos a ceder ante las demandas del otro as que decidi atacarme para corroborar sus amenazas
2166461 agach ndome para esquivar sub mi pie para darle una patada en la cara a pesar del casco not que le doli retrocedi unos pasos mientras emit a un quejido lo cu l me di tiempo suficiente para tomar su lanza y golpearlo con la parte posterior tumb ndolo al piso una vez abajo le piz el cuello y le puse la punta de la lanza en la frente
2166462 no me interesa dime lo que quiero saber cu l es tu anterior casa la que ten as antes de invadir sta
2166463 lo solt en cuanto dijo eso levant las tablas de mi guarida y baj para recoger mis cosas pero el tipo era un tramposo tap el hoyo con la tabla inmediatamente atravez el suelo con la lanza en se al de amenaza primero una y luego otras dos veces puse todo de mi parte para no lastimar al hombre que asustado se disculp y quit la tabla sub con mis cosas en una mano y la lanza en la otra
2166464 entonces me quedo aqu lo nico que quiero es un techo donde pueda descansar y no me molesten
2166465 me llev a la otra casa y se fu con su familia a la que alguna vez fu mi hogar sin nada en el est mago puse una s banas en el suelo y us otras cuantas como almohada fu la mejor noche en meses
2166466 al d a siguiente decid que era hora de hacer una prueba agarr una muestra del agua que tra a entre mi equipaje la mitad m s o menos lo dem s lo guard donde estaba
2166467 me dirig al lago y captur una rana que tuvo la mala fortuna de pasar por ah a despu s de darle de beber un poco del agua muri eso era lo contrario a lo que me dijeron que hac a
2166468 me est n persiguiendo y cre que ste era un buen lugar para esconderme
2166469 no me importa lo que hagan mientras no me molesten
2166470 vivo aqu para que nadie me haga esa pregunta deja de molestar ni o
2166471 en el tiempo que he estado aqu no lo he visto comer ni una vez qu pasa con usted
2166472 no necesito comer no voy a morir si importar lo que haga
2166473 entonces usted bebi de esa fuente y ahora es inmortal
2166474 lo primero es hacer el pacto que libera al agua en su estado actual no es m s que un veneno
2166475 la rana no se movi en horas as que decid olvidarme de toda esa basura y fu a buscar algo de comer
2166476 entr a una taberna y ped algo de comer reci n terminaba cuando el anuncio de que mis alardes del d a anterior hab an dado frutos entr xin con los dos guardias que le quedaban
2166477 empez a preguntar por m a todos pero nadie me conoc a como necesitaba reposar mi comida decid salir abruptamente por la ventana con ellos not ndome con la facilidad m s grande del mundo y llendo tras de m
2166478 con mis grandes habilidades para escalar paredes sub a los techos y los us como escondite de emergencia aunque no eran muy buenos con toda la gente diciendo donde estaba en cuanto logr despistarlos fui a visitar a uno de mis dos sospechosos el que no era stain lo hice por conveniencia
2166479 se quedaron algo desconcertados pero siguieron con su d a lo m s normal que pudieron hasta que xin toc a la puerta a hacer un interrogatorio
2166480 si le sugiero que tenga cuidado y si lo v av senos es muy peligroso
2166481 obviamente l no me hab a delatado hab a sido stain entonces que chill n
2166482 los guardias ya se fueron vas a estar seguro hasta ma ana si stain no te ve
2166483 empez a seguirme y pronto saltamos a otros temas que hab an quedado sin cubrir el d a anterior
2166484 llegamos a mi casa le repet en varias ocasiones que se fuera o le causar a problemas pero no me hizo caso saqu mi equipaje del lugar donde estaba escondido y ella empez a esculcarlo hasta que sac el agua
2166485 un viejo me dijo que era m gica pero la prob en una rana esta ma ana y se muri inmediatamente
2166486 claro dijiste que ten a sed verdad voy por algo de agua
2166487 puse el agua donde mismo que pon a todo lo dem s que hab a pasado por sus manos y despu s de agarrar un recipiente fu al nico lugar con agua gratis que se me ocurri el lago
2166488 llen el recipiente y prob el agua no estaba tan mal parec a que los ni os de ahora ya no se ba aban ah
2166489 sin saber que hacer como en las otras 59 ocasiones me acerqu para asegurarme de su estado pero no hab a muchas pruebas que hacer
2166490 hab a un patr n muy exacto en stas situaciones despu s de ser dejado a una distancia corta del cuerpo alguien generalmente familiar cercano de la v ctima llegaba en el momento en el que comprobaba los signos vitales por lo que en cuanto lo hac a sta vez volte la mirada a la puerta de entrada pero no hab a nadie sin saber si era un simple capricho y al encontrarme en una situaci n completamente nueva la v ctima nunca hab a sido alguien que conociera desde chico me encontraba muy confundido pero pronto llegu a la conclusi n de que deber a escapar lo m s pronto posible del pueblo
2166491 un par de horas despu s lleg stain es ir nico que la nica vez que tuve la perfecta oportunidad de hu r no lo hice se puso furioso al vernos sentados en el piso su cabeza sobre mi hombro y la m a sobre la suya con sus ojos cerrados y los m os hinchados y h medos el calor de su cuerpo se hab a ido
2166492 r pidamente se dirigi hacia m y me levant para tirarme al piso de un golpe en la cara y luego empez a patearme las costillas
2166493 stain se volvi a maria y empez a gritarle y reprocharle la amenazaba con una golpiza mientras la levantaba y se daba cuenta de su fallecimiento se qued inm vil unos segundos y luego le toc la frente para soltarla y dejarla caer momentos despu s
2166494 reaccion hist ricamente hacia m como buen y predecible humano d ndome otra sesi n de golpes que detuve con una precisa patada en la barbilla justo momentos antes de ponerme de pie
2166495 dale un entierro digno y dile a xin que estar en el lago
2166496 levant mis cosas incluyendo la lanza que le quit al ex guardia y me fu de ah entre gritos y ataques frustrados los avent al techo de la casa y sub luego sin que stain me viera
2166497 cuando despert me dirig al cementerio a las afueras manteniendome en los techos lo m s posible y me dediqu a mirar de lejos la estaban enterrando apenas todo el pueblo estaba presente
2166498 al mediod a fu al lago del otro lado del pueblo a pasar el rato mientras segu a analizando mi vida como no pod an esperar a que llegara xin a quien hab an ido a llamar ya decidieron formar una turba iracunda e ir por su propia cuenta con cualquier cosa que tuvieran a la mano para eliminarme sab an donde estar a y aunque no era un pueblo peque o sin escondites
2166499 se me culpa de 60 asesinatos m s de la mitad son bastante brutales creen que pueden con alguien como yo s lo por que son muchos por m s que sean no pueden atacarme eficientemente m s de cuatro de ustedes ya que no los voy a dejar rodearme creen que se me dificultar a pelear contra cuatro pueblerinos novatos con palos en las manos
2166500 pongan a su mejor peleador frente a m y denle su mejor arma pelear contra l con mis propias manos
2166501 mencionaron el nombre de alguien no me interesaba y empujaron hacia el frente al ex guardia al que le hab a pateado el trasero el d a anterior con otra lanza el tipo temblaba tanto que apenas pod a sostener su arma
2166502 hice un movimiento de amenaza y call al suelo l s lo dejando caer su arma al piso en el proceso
2166503 le gan ayer con un par de movimientos de principiantes si ste es su mejor guerrero esperen a que venga xin y me mate por su propio bien
2166504 con miedo todos volvieron a sus casas y no salieron por el resto del d a
2166505 empezaba a anochecer cuando fui por mi lanza y volv al lago de pronto record lo de la rana as que curioso fui al lugar en el que la hab a dejado pero no estaba me puse a buscarla por todos lados era una rana verde con una mancha amarilla en los ojos como si fuera un antifaz as que podr a reconocerla f cilmente
2166506 la encontr aplastada por una piedra no sab a c mo hab a llegado ah pero supuse que hab a sido la travesura de un ni o que al verla muerta se le habr a ocurrido aplastarla al levantar la piedra vi lo que me har a recuperar mis esperanzas de una forma incre ble la rana simplemente se levant como si nada hubiera pasado y empez a brincar por todos lados no pod a creerlo empec a buscarle una explicaci n como que no era la misma del veneno y que la piedra no la hab a aplastado bien
2166507 atrap a la rana y la pis tan fuerte como pude pero cuando le quit el pie de encima sigui dando brincos algo atolondrada entonces hice la prueba con otra pero muri irremediablemente maria estaba enterrada viva
2166508 deb a desenterrarla lo m s pronto posible no sab a cu nto tiempo duraba el estado de muerte temporal pero no ten a tiempo que perder en cuanto me volv en direcci n al pueblo para empezar mi camino al cementerio vi a xin corriendo hacia m con su espada desenfundada y listo para el combate
2166509 prepar mi lanza para su primer ataque el cu l esquiv de cualquier forma
2166510 xin no tengo tiempo dame cinco minutos tengo algo que hacer

2166512 no iba a dejarlo escapar o poner en marcha su plan parec a fingir preocupaci n o remordimiento por algo pero zien era experto en fingir emociones en realidad era un asesino despiadado que dejaba muertes por donde quiera que pasaba y luego lo negaba despu s de ser descubierto en el momento
2166513 ten a que vencerlo para poder salvar a maria hasta ese momento no me importaba morir en la batalla pero despu s de descubrir que segu a ah con vida ten a que ganar sin importar las condiciones
2166514 seguimos la pelea me dedicaba a bloquear sus ataques mientras lo golpeaba con la parte posterior mi ventaja era clara pero l no se rend a
2166515 lo que m s me molestaba era que parec a no pelear en serio durante todo este tiempo nunca me hab a hecho ning n da o pero con el resto de los guardias parec a pelear de forma diferente era como si quisiera hacer notar que yo no era rivel para l pero sta vez era diferente yo ten a un as bajo la manga
2166516 no pod a concentrarme en la pelea pero a n as xin no era un buen oponente en un movimiento que no entend retrocedi agarr su funda y corri hacia m dando un salto justo antes de llegar
2166517 hab a planeado este movimiento por meses no hab a forma de escapar ahora
2166518 era perfecto estando yo en el aire reaccion r pido y me lanz un golpe horizontal que fu demasiado lejos me cubr con espada y funda para que no me hiciera da o as que fu s lo el empuj n su bloqueo fu tan fuerte que ca justo detr s de l mientras intentaba recuperarse
2166519 cay detr s de m con la misma fuerza que llevaba del golpe anterior me d la vuelta s lo para ser embestido
2166520 lo embest con todas mis fuerzas antes de que tuviera tiempo de responder cay al suelo y
2166521 puso su espada a unos cent metros de mi cuello hab a perdido
2166522 ten a una fuerza bruta incre ble debiste hacer trampa

2166524 deja de mentir por qu auron iba a matarlos tiene alguna l gica
2166525 lo ltimo que me dijo fue escapa por favor despu s de cortar la pared con una espada
2166526 auron estaba ah a un lado nuestro preguntando por m
2166527 en ese momento ten a dos razones para salir corriendo y mi miedo por auron era la que menos me motivaba
2166528 zien se escapaba pero no importaba seguro auron me ayudar a a atraparlo despu s con su ayuda terminar amos con la maldad de zien para siempre
2166529 nadie se hace viejo en una semana no digas disparates

2166537 mientras corr a me preguntaba por qu nos hab a dejado vivir treinta a os en tal miseria si de todas formas iba a matarnos al final pero deb a sacar a maria de su tumba antes de morir
2166538 llegu a la tumba y empec a cavar con mis manos hasta que lleg el velador y me golpe con su pala afortunadamente fu lo suficiente amable para soltarla al caer desmayado con el golpe en la mand bula que le d as que empec a usarla
2166539 el agua de la vida eterna creo que puedes llamarla as recupera el aliento
2166540 sal del hoyo y ayud a maria a salir a lo lejos v que auron se acercaba
2166541 pero no pod a moverse estaba aterrada de la horrible experiencia que acababa de terminar mientras yo abandonaba toda esperanza de supervivencia pero entonces record que ten a algo de agua conmigo pod a salvarme

2166575 when indiraji was killed rajiv was a political greenhorn but we stood by him and he soon matured into a great leader and when rajiv was killed we hoped sonia ji would take over immediately if she had done so the congress party would have reaped a massive sympathy vote in 1991 and would have been stronger than it is today

2166591 its certainly getting a lot of hype and no one likes paying line rental when they dont use their phone much or at all
2166592 this hidden cost can range from 15 20 so while its typically less than what youd pay for line rental the saving may only be 5 10 depending on what line rental plan youre on and it can be worth paying that little extra to have a landline there just in case you need it in case the net or voip isnt working or for incoming calls

2166598 and thou shalt set the table without the vail and the candlestick over against the table on the side of the tabernacle toward the south and thou shalt put the table on the north side

2166601 the cloud filled the house of the lord so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud for the glory of the lord had filled the house of the lord
2166602 the lord said that he would dwell in thick darkness i have surely built thee an house to dwell in a settled place for thee to abide in for ever
2166603 and the lord said unto david my father whereas it was in thine heart to build an house unto my name thou didst well that it was in thine heart nevertheless thou shalt not build the house but thy son that shall come forth out of thy loins he shall build the house unto my name and the lord hath performed his word that he spake and i am risen up in the room of david my father and sit on the throne of israel as the lord promised and have built an house for the name of the lord god of israel
2166604 cloud heavy or dark cloud darkness gross darkness or thick darkness
2166605 and the people stood afar off and moses drew near unto the thick darkness where god was
2166606 and ye came near and stood under the mountain and the mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven with darkness clouds and thick darkness
2166607 these words the lord spake unto all your assembly in the mount out of the midst of the fire of the cloud and of the thick darkness with a great voice and he added no more and he wrote them in two tables of stone and delivered them unto me
2166608 the lord reigneth let the earth rejoice let the multitude of isles be glad thereof clouds and darkness are round about him righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne
2166609 arise shine for thy light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising
2166610 give glory to the lord your god before he cause darkness and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death and make it gross darkness
2166611 for thus saith the lord god behold i even i will both search my sheep and seek them out as a shepherd seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep that are scattered so will i seek out my sheep and will deliver them out of all places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day and i will bring them out from the people and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land and feed them upon the mountains of israel by the rivers and in all the inhabited places of the country i will feed them in a good pasture and upon the high mountains of israel shall their fold be there shall they lie in a good fold and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of israel i will feed my flock and i will cause them to lie down saith the lord god i will seek that which was lost and bring again that which was driven away and will bind up that which was broken and will strengthen that which was sick
2166612 blow ye the trumpet in zion and sound an alarm in my holy mountain let all the inhabitants of the land tremble for the day of the lord cometh for it is nigh at hand a day of darkness and of gloominess a day of clouds and of thick darkness as the morning spread upon the mountains a great people and a strong there hath not been ever the like neither shall be any more after it even to the years of many generations
2166613 the great day of the lord is near it is near and hasteth greatly even the voice of the day of the lord the mighty man shall cry there bitterly that day is a day of wrath a day of trouble and distress a day of wasteness and desolation a day of darkness and gloominess a day of clouds and thick darkness
2166614 and let them make me a sanctuary that i may dwell among them according to all that i shew thee after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all the instruments thereof even so shall ye make it
2166615 and look that thou make them after their pattern which was shewed thee in the mount
2166616 who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things as moses was admonished of god when he was about to make the tabernacle for see saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount
2166617 who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do ye see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing yet now be strong o zerubbabel saith the lord and be strong o joshua son of josedech the high priest and be strong all ye people of the land saith the lord and work for i am with you saith the lord of hosts according to the word that i covenanted with you when ye came out of egypt so my spirit remaineth among you fear ye not for thus saith the lord of hosts yet once it is a little while and i will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land and i will shake all nations and the desire of all nations shall come and i will fill this house with glory saith the lord of hosts the silver is mine and the gold is mine saith the lord of hosts the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former saith the lord of hosts and in this place will i give peace saith the lord of hosts
2166618 but will god indeed dwell on the earth behold the heaven and heaven of heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have builded
2166619 destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up then said the jews forty and six years was this temple in building and wilt thou rear it up in three days but he spake of the temple of his body when therefore he was risen from the dead his disciples remembered that he had said this unto them and they believed the scripture and the word which jesus had said
2166620 at the last came two false witnesses and said this fellow said i am able to destroy the temple of god and to build it in three days and the high priest arose and said unto him answerest thou nothing what is it which these witness against thee but jesus held his peace and the high priest answered and said unto him i adjure thee by the living god that thou tell us whether thou be the christ the son of god jesus saith unto him thou hast said nevertheless i say unto you hereafter shall ye see the son of man sitting on the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven then the high priest rent his clothes saying he hath spoken blasphemy what further need have we of witnesses behold now ye have heard his blasphemy what think ye they answered and said he is guilty of death
2166621 in my fathers house are many mansions if it were not so i would have told you i go to prepare a place for you and if i go and prepare a place for you i will come again and receive you unto myself that where i am there ye may be also

2166623 and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of men
2166624 then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward sanctuary which looketh toward the east and it was shut then said the lord unto me this gate shall be shut it shall not be opened and no man shall enter in by it because the lord the god of israel hath entered in by it therefore it shall be shut it is for the prince the prince he shall sit in it to eat bread before the lord he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate and shall go out by the way of the same

2166635 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by daniel the prophet stand in the holy place whoso readeth let him understand then let them which be in judaea flee into the mountains
2166636 and the beast that was and is not even he is the eighth and is of the seven and goeth into perdition
2166637 and i turned to see the voice that spake with me
2166638 and when forty years were expired there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount sina an angel of the lord in a flame of fire in a bush
2166639 and they shall fall by the edge of the sword and shall be led away captive into all nations and jerusalem shall be trodden down of the gentiles until the times of the gentiles be fulfilled and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and in the stars and upon the earth distress of nations with perplexity the sea and the waves roaring mens hearts failing them for fear and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth for the powers of heaven shall be shaken

2166642 therefore thus saith the lord i am returned to jerusalem with mercies my house shall be built in it saith the lord of hosts and a line shall be stretched forth upon jerusalem
2166643 then lifted i up mine eyes and saw and behold four horns and i said unto the angel that talked with me what be these and he answered me these are the horns which have scattered judah israel and jerusalem and the lord shewed me four carpenters then said i what come these to do and he spake saying these are the horns which have scattered judah so that no man did lift up his head but these are come to fray them to cast out the horns of the gentiles which lifted up their horn over the land of judah to scatter it
2166644 theres a lot of people who just dont believe the economys going to stay strong enough to keep prices of things where they are

2166675 sweet 16 action has been slow but well get a lot on thursday and friday
2166676 so far betting has been split between unlv and oregon but by friday i expect well get a lot of unlv money
2166677 they can win thats why oregon is a small favorite
2166678 if they get past oregon florida will be tough to beat though all of the pressure would be on them and unlv would have nothing to lose
2166679 if florida and unlv played 10 to 15 times the rebels would win a couple and maybe this would be one of the times
2166680 i dont think so but this year weve had more bets on the cubs than usual
2166681 i wouldnt be shocked to see them do something but i dont think it will happen
2166682 theyre a strong team that plays good defense but nobody else really leaps out at me
2166683 the sames teams that battled it out last year should be doing it again this season the yankees and red sox in the east chicago and detroit in the central
2166684 the white sox didnt make the playoffs last year but i think theyll be right back in the mix
2166685 the twins have good young pitching and it depends on how that comes through especially francisco loriano
2166686 as far as betting goes we always get the most money on teams from new york chicago and la
2166687 once the season begins or a month or two into it youre going to see more money bet on the mets and of course yankees
2166688 i like the cardinals again in the central not the cubs
2166689 the dodgers could be a contender and im not totally hooked on the giants
2166690 theres a lot of parity and mediocrity in the nl west

2166790 there is not enough evidence that could be presented even to a military commission chaired by a military judge partly there may not be evidence and partly the risk of issues of torture being raised is too high
2166791 bringing them to court would bring to the courts attention the method through which the evidence including the confessions were obtained so this is one further affirmation of the conclusion that the cia or others have been involved in methods of interrogation that are incompatible with international law
2166792 this is illustrative of the tightness of the regime in which the high value detainees are held which of course gives further suspicion to the inference that they have in their possession information concerning the interrogation techniques used upon them which must not come into daylight
2166793 and therefore their prosecution even before the military commissions is excluded for the time being
2166794 the destruction of video tapes on cia interrogations is one more argument that supports the contention that the cia has been involved and continues to be involved in the use of interrogation techniques that violate the absolute prohibition against torture

2166805 there are distinct phases in investment madness in emerging markets phase 1 is growth you get a lot of foreign investment it is mainly relocation of production facilities cheap brown people to do dirty jobs for nothing you dig up cut down everything you can the locals deregulate everything because the world bank tells them it will attract foreign investment government owned businesses are sold cheaply to the favoured sons and their foreign cronies government controls are relaxed as the foreigners tell the locals that it will create jobs and wealth
2166806 prices dont make any rational sense you only buy because you think you can sell it tomorrow to someone else at a higher price you are caught in an endless spiral of higher and higher prices fear and greed rule financial markets you are afraid that you might miss out your greed is endless foreigners develop a peculiar hubris they are bullet proof fundamentals of value are irrelevant in this world

2166810 sb 1204 is a key piece of legislation being promoted this session by the special interest lobby group texans for lawsuit reform in addition to decimating local control of the courts many of the proposals contained in this bill would establish roadblocks to individuals having their cases heard by a citizen jury in a timely manner these delay tactics only serve to benefit tlrs wealthy supporters who have business interests before the courts on a regular basis we encourage the state affairs committee to kill this bill

2166832 a large part of the rise in inflation can be explained by surging international food and oil prices
2166833 strong demand at home the result of past policy looseness is allowing retailers to pass on that cost to consumers

2166845 our sense is that when the inflation numbers had started to go up the central bank had the option to allow the currency rise at their discretion
2166846 that has now been taken away because the current account position isnt strong and capital inflows arent rising either

2166915 when we played belladrum last year wed only released debut single its not about you at the time and when we finished our set we did a little a cappella version
2166916 the crowd were screaming so much i couldnt actually hear myself through the monitors it was the first time wed ever experienced anything like that we even had to do an encore as well and we went out and played its not about you again and literally the crowd just sang it for us it was awesome
2166917 its kind of sky rocketed absolutely crazy myself and roy were chatting and we reckoned that by the end of the festival season this year well have played to half a million people since we started touring last february
2166918 weve been playing together so long on such an up and downy road that we never had any preconceptions or expectations of what this would be like its just so bizarre when you walk out on stage and theres 15 000 20 000 people out there and theyre all singing along
2166919 we played the isle of wight festival and walking out to a crowd of 55 000 people on a stage that jimi hendrix walked out on was probably my most rock and roll feeling moment
2166920 its really weird its like everythings changed but nothings changed the one constant all our adult lives is playing in the band together and weve been doing it so long it feels kind of normal but thats because its just the three of use doing it its the most crazy lifestyle and if we didnt have each other we wouldnt be quite so grounded were not very rock and roll to be honest we dont really trash hotel rooms were just three nice lads you can take home to meet your mum
2166921 ive travelled to more places in the last six months than i have my entire life
2166922 we had to stop making all the badges and handbooks ourselves at the end of last year and got one of our mates to do it but then it just got crazy because we were sending out a few thousand each week
2166923 were trying to move to a more environmentally friendly download your own membership website
2166924 we just wanted to go back to old school fan clubs like the dennis the menace and beano fan clubs you sent off for your little thing from the beano and you got a membership card and your little dennis badge and your gnasher badge through the post we wanted to hit the nostalgia a little bit but our wolfcubs have been nothing but amazing we pretty much owe them everything
2166925 roy and pete were in the scouts but i was in the air cadets where we got to fly planes and have fun while they went off trekking
2166926 you dont usually get to see much at most festivals youre at so itll be nice to spend some time wandering about the site
2166927 im really looking forward to seeing how the players develop over the next year because i think that weve got a real blend of youth and experience in every area
2166928 when we came back to start pre season i told the experienced players it was their responsibility to look after the younger ones while i told the young boys they had to keep putting pressure on the experienced players to try and force their way into the team
2166929 yes we have a very young squad but sometimes when you throw young players in they suddenly become men so ive no qualms about doing that if or when required i dont know about any of the young players being involved on saturday but if called upon i have no doubts they will be ready
2166930 the pressure will be on aberdeen given theyve got home advantage
2166931 however its up to us to try and cope with that and try to cause aberdeen problems
2166932 im sure jimmy calderwood the aberdeen manager will have them ready
2166933 barry nicholson left this summer and he will be a big loss but theyve brought in guys like mark kerr who has been around the block a few times and gary macdonald who has had a year down in england so theyll be confident but so are we
2166934 to be given the opportunity to be based in the highlands and islands and help my subject get a much higher profile is a dream come true
2166935 there are certainly a number of projects i would like to get going back on the ground
2166936 i have this desire not just to finish off what i started but continue to press the boundaries of my subject im a muddy boots archaeologist
2166937 i think we can play to the archaeological strengths of the highlands and islands
2166938 a lot of work does go on in the highlands you have the highland archaeology forum which holds a conference every october and a lot of that goes on at a very high level there are already professional archaeologists here obviously but i think theres the opportunity for really looking at how we can take highland archaeology forward without treading on anyones toes
2166939 my ultimate and possibly unrealistic aim is for there to be an archaeological presence across the uhi network
2166940 clearly we are not at that stage yet but im encouraged by the positive attitude there is within the uhi to archaeology theres a will to see it succeed and to grow
2166941 the days of competition between universities either are over or should be over im afraid that in the 80s and 90s and into the new century we were encouraged to be much more competitive market forces and universities dont mix
2166942 i think one of the unfortunate results of professionalism is that archaeology has been marginalised
2166943 a lot of amateur groups can do work to a professional standard we can teach them techniques and then when they have learned those techniques they can just go off and do it
2166944 i think this approach is the right one for things of regional importance rather than national importance
2166945 i think professionals have also looked askance at things like time team a three day wonder is not the way that we work but it has brought the awareness of archaeology much more into the public mind
2166946 for example 10 years ago geophysics would have meant nothing to most people but now because of time team a lot more people have heard of it im very much in favour of the media getting involved in archaeology and im generally very happy with the way its presented but you have to be careful not to overdramatise it
2166947 i think the ideal of uhi is a brilliant one people are realising that the concept of uhi does bring something extra where before they had a further education college now they have a higher education institution
2166948 it is such a great concept that we have to make sure that its a success but with the technology available video conferencing and everything one can be in touch with people who are far flung
2166949 archaeology is as good a university education as anything and in fact i would argue that its a better one than most
2166950 twenty or 30 years ago it was almost a case of dead mans shoes if you wanted a job but with the growth of archaeology on the ground there have been more opportunities
2166951 ive been on unst on a very bad day and then a lot of people lose the attraction for archaeology
2166952 i have had such a wonderful journey and i thank everyone that has supported me through out the years life is ever changing and its time to hang up my headphones when it comes to live performances i will continue to produce the finest podcasts for the world to enjoy

2167038 anti prostitution zealot melissa farley has descended upon las vegas with manipulative statistics and rhetoric claiming to help prostitutes by criminalizing their industry of course that forces it further underground fundamentalist feminists like her are harming not helping prostitutes
2167039 the assumption all women in vegas are exploited and disrespected because of the sexualized tourist atmosphere is patently false
2167040 womens experiences working in the sex industry are far more complex and varied than melissa farleys research suggest
2167041 if you start with the premise that prostitution is inherently harmful and dangerous to women it is not difficult to find examples to support this premise and to ignore those examples that do not
2167042 women have many different reasons for entering the industry it is important to hear all voices of those involved

2167122 we were looking for a suitable magnetic fluid preparation for medical application and my research experience on cashew in mysore university led us to use anacardic acid and cnsl in general for this purpose
2167123 obviously the size can be altered by changing the ratio of anacardic acid to metal
2167124 and by mixing different metal complexes in solution literally any alloy composition in colloidal form can be generated which is unprecedented

2167163 almost two weeks ago txir released an eye opening report taking a closer look at tlrs legislative activities this generated an overwhelming response from grassroots activists who had no idea what tlr actually lobbied for and previously believed that tlr was committed to advancing ideologically conservative principles
2167164 since tlr is unwilling to post information on their website regarding their belief that texan voters are not capable of electing good judges we have decided to post their own materials on judicial selection unedited on our website
2167165 we hope by making this information readily available to the public texas voters will take a closer look at tlrs true motives and special interest agenda

2167187 by combining single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer and an optical trap we now have a technique that can detect subtle conformational changes of a biomolecule at an extremely low applied force
2167188 by combining the two techniques we get the best of both worlds
2167189 using the optical trap we can pull on dna strands with forces as small as half a pico newton using single molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer we can measure the resulting conformational changes with nanometer precision
2167190 based on our previous studies we knew the holliday junction fluctuated between two structures

2167237 i love you im going to miss you you know its going to be lonely here without you
2167238 yeah i know im going to miss you too great grandma
2167239 are you kidding me you wouldnt teach how to drive i still pass my test and im moving out and you still wont let me drive
2167240 you can drive all you want when youre not living with me
2167241 yeah i gotta got out of here ill come back to visit though
2167242 good thing you are leaving rocky that whore would probably have made you marry her
2167243 youre going to meet a nice normal new york girl who doesnt want to get pregnant at sixteen and wants to go to college
2167244 you dont have to do this if you dont want to
2167245 no im fine i want to do this im just going to miss my friends
2167246 i cant believe you called ronnie and told him we would see him
2167247 well i dunno he was really nice when i met him in vegas
2167248 hes a very nice person its just that its been over twenty years and i dont look the same as i used to
2167249 well hes huge so i wouldnt really worry about it
2167250 you look tried grandma and you can barely reach the pedals maybe i should drive
2167251 ive been driving for forty years and youve been driving for two i dont need you to tell me how to drive
2167252 yeah we need to see whats in the back of the truck
2167253 no because we would be out of control by now quit driving so close to the wall i knew that i should have drove
2167254 well apparently not just get us there we came this far without wrecking the truck
2167255 hey rocky oh my god its so good to see you ive missed you so much are you excited
2167256 oh anyways i cant believe i start college in a couple of days
2167257 yep youre a man now rocky your almost grown up
2167258 because i gave up my wonderful apartment so that i could have space for you to come live here
2167259 your going to be so successful rocky dont worry about what everyone else is doing back in alabama you know this is the right decision
2167260 yeah im not worried about that i mean im in the biggest city in the world im really excited about this
2167261 im glad rocky your all that i care about and i just want you to have a better life than i did
2167262 im nervous about living with mom i mean its been a long time
2167263 i know rocky but she is your mother and trust me yous are a lot alike both a pain in the ass
2167264 i like the train i got my own little compartment and i get to see all the scenery of america
2167265 im going to miss you so much i cant believe youre leaving me
2167266 ill be home for christmas and plus in a few years youll be living up here too
2167267 let me get on the train before i start crying again
2167268 reproducibility is one of the major issues facing nanotechnology and its required us to depart from the standard ways of achieving this in micro electronics processing
2167269 when you first hear of opening up a wire with a current you usually think of a fuse to think that this sort of technique could actually lead to atomically precise nanoelectronics is sort of mind blowing
2167270 its too bad it would have been nice for us to finish off the game
2167271 but the idea is to improve from the first preseason game to the second weve got a lot to work on
2167272 obviously weve got some work to do but thats what the preseason is for
2167273 it was good to go up against a different defense and it was good to see the receivers in live action
2167274 i wish he had gotten a chance to finish it off
2167275 we had plenty of time and he had us in great position
2167276 when we have good protection the turnovers are going to go down when youre not under duress you have the ability to make better decisions
2167277 the key to everything is running the ball its hard work but we have to stay at it
2167278 i liked the way he moved the ball down the field
2167279 were particularly excited about our findings because they show that we can achieve these results by using quantum dots and readily available relatively inexpensive optical telecommunications technology to drive quantum computers
2167280 quantum dots replace transistors in these computers and our results show that it only takes a few billionths of a watt to drive it
2167281 were just looking for him to compete and give us an opportunity to win the game
2167282 im not asking for him to throw nine shutout innings
2167283 attacking the zone being ahead in the count and using all his pitches
2167284 when hes right hes living on the edges and throwing a lot of strikes we need him to do that
2167285 when theyre balls youre nibbling and when theyre strikes youve got great control
2167286 its a fine line that a lot of pitchers walk in this game sometimes youre just a fraction of an inch off and all of a sudden youre nibbling
2167287 i expect him to come up and continue the little bit of a roll that hes been on in triple a
2167288 i think he can pull from what hes been doing down there hes been throwing the ball well
2167289 we just kind of put an oar in the water and things finally just heated up real quick at the end
2167290 weve been able to count on him taking the ball every five days and giving us a good start
2167291 thats really big because we have a lot of road games left
2167292 one of the reasons we have a winning record is that hes been so good on the road
2167293 consciousness is a series of mental states but when the brain shuts down where does the mind go
2167294 i miss my old blog amp i want my own domain finally
2167295 i am surprised to know that a group of persons due to their poor knowledge thought that sunnat jamat followers of the prophet has enmity with the family members of prophet but the fact is that the members of sunnat jamat are the followers of the prophets family members
2167296 i am friend of the holy prophet muhammed pbuh and his family members so if this is enmity then all human beings and jins should be witness on this enmity
2167297 in the older abu bakr siddiq ra and omar farouq ra in the young men osman bin affan ra and ali bin abi talib ra in the women ayesha ra and in the girls fatima ra
2167298 why did he want to kill such a noble and great person who is in loneliness in the house and busy in the worship of allah and who left the worldly life and pleasure so it is against expedience
2167299 when he entered his palace he saw a big python with him and his two lips were open and one was on the upper side and the other was below of the throne
2167300 if you do any harm to jafar al sadiq i would swallow you with your seat
2167301 oh son of the prophet pray for me as my heart become black
2167302 oh abu suleiman you are also pious person of the time so no need of my prayers
2167303 oh son of the prophet allah gave you a such greatness and it is obligatory for you to give advice to all muslims
2167304 oh abu suleiman i am afraid that on the day of judgement my grand father will caught me and will ask me why i have not fulfilled my duties properly and allah will not see the inheritance but see the good deeds
2167305 oh allah his inheritance is from the holy prophet and his habits are superior and his grand father is the holy prophet and his mother is batool great woman but he is still worried then who is dawood and why he is so proudly on his deeds
2167306 oh son of the prophet why did you need our recommendations as your grandfather will recommend all the creatures
2167307 he is ashamed of his deeds so he is afraid to see the face of his grandfather
2167308 oh son of the prophet people are not getting your grace as you are in the loneliness of the house
2167309 the faithfulness is not seen as the traveller on the journey will not see again and people are busy with their thinking and necessities people express love for each other but their hearts are full of poison
2167310 oh son of the prophet it is not suitable for the prophets family member to wear such a dress
2167311 this dress is for the allah and other is for the mankind
2167312 the animals could do these things as they recognize who beat them and who love them
2167313 one who could make difference between two good things and two bad things and choose one good thing which is more good from the two goods things and one bad thing which is less bad from the two bad things
2167314 you have all qualities of pious persons and have kindness and coolness of the family members of the prophet but you have more proudness
2167315 i am not proudly but my lord is great so when i discontinued proudness and greatness these things entered into me so upon allahs greatness one can feel proud but one should not be proudly for greatness of his own
2167316 he would never take back anything which he gives to anybody
2167317 oh allah i do not have trouser and dress with me
2167318 oh great man i was also reciting allah allah behind you so please give me your old dress
2167319 have you not heard what allah told prophet moses pbuh that you did not able to see him
2167320 his heart was seen allah and other person is crying that he will not worship allah until he could see allah
2167321 when i was calling others then there was a veil but when i called allah for his help with eagerness then i saw allah in the window which opened in my heart if there was no eagerness and passion then allah will be not there
2167322 is somebody there who will reply the needy persons call
2167323 when he was calling others for his help then he was false and advice him to take care of the window in the heart
2167324 one who says allah is on the things or allah is from things and so for this saying he will become unbeliever
2167325 one who commits sin with fear and seek allahs repentance and then he will become closer to allah when one who worships in the beginning for himself and in the last for the show and proud for this he will be kept him away from allah one who is proud for his worship then he will become a sinner sincere is one who will repent for his sins
2167326 who is better either sincere pious person or wealthy person
2167327 pious person is better than other one because wealthy person always looks for the bags of money but pious person is always with allah
2167328 the worship is not right without repentance because allah preferred repentance than worship
2167329 refer to quranic teaching in which it is clear that repentance is superior to the worship
2167330 he bestow his mercy on any one whom he likes
2167331 the faithful is one who stands against nafs i ammara inordinate appetites and the pious is one who stands in the worship of allah
2167332 one who fight against nafs i ammara for the sake of himself then he will become the man of miracles
2167333 one who fights with nafs i ammara for the sake of allah then he finds allah
2167334 ilham revelation is a sign of allahs blessing for his accepted persons but when this matter is proved that it is nothing by logic and this is the work of unbelievers
2167335 allah is more hidden in the man than the movements of the black ants on the black mountains during the night the love of allah is neither good nor bad the secret which i come to know when i became mad it is good for a man if he has wise enemy
2167336 allahs heaven and hell are also in this world when there are no worries it is heaven and when there are worries it is hell it is heaven when we should approach allah for all our works it is hell when we surrender all our works to nafs i ammara
2167337 it may be due to two reasons first due to his conditions and second is to respect my shariat islamic law because his mother is old and blind
2167338 when you will meet him convey my salam and ask him to pray for the muslims
2167339 in yemen there is a camel look after owaise and you have to follow his foot steps
2167340 no but there is a mad person who lives away from the people
2167341 he lives in arna valley and looks after the camels eats dry bread in the night neither come to the village nor talk to the people
2167342 we all are slaves of allah but i am asking your proper name
2167343 the prophet has conveyed his salam and has sent his dress for you and asked you to pray for the muslims
2167344 you are superior so you pray as you are very close to the prophet
2167345 i will pray but you also pray according to the advice of the prophet
2167346 oh allah i will not wear the dress until you accept my recommendation for all muslims and for this the prophet has sent his dress and omer farouq ra and ali ibn taleb ra have done their work now your work is left
2167347 i will not wear the dress until you forgive all muslims
2167348 anybody is there who can purchase his caliphate for a piece of bread
2167349 have you seen the forehead of the prophet if you have seen then tell me whether his eyebrows were close or scattered
2167350 this is my earning from camel grazing if you guarantee that these two dinars are enough for my entire life then i will accept the other things from you otherwise i do not need anything
2167351 i recognized you due to your greatness and what i have heard about you
2167352 oh owaise allah has blessed you granted his mercy and has forgiven you
2167353 oh harm the son of huban god bless you what thing you have brought here and who showed you my address
2167354 how do you know my name and my fathers name as i have not seen you before
2167355 allah told me who knows everything my soul recognized your soul as soul of muslim knows each other
2167356 it is very sad that their hearts are full of doubts and suspicions and they do not accept the pieces of advice
2167357 oh son of huban your father died adam as eve as noah as abraham as moses as david as also died abu bakr ra died who was the first caliph my brother omer ra also died
2167358 oh son of huban you will not see me and i will not see you again but remember me in your prayers because i to remember you in my prayers you go on that way and i will follow this way
2167359 oh allah keep me away from full sleep and full food in the stomach and it is enough for me and i have come back to you
2167360 i want it will be dawn before i did not say subhan allah in the prostration as i want to do worship same as angels do in the sky
2167361 if there is wound of spear on your body but you did not notice it
2167362 oh the journey is long but no preparations at all
2167363 as per islamic law the men are allowed to marry four women so the women may also be allowed to marry at least two men
2167364 if they have children after marriage form two husbands then how they will recognize that who is the father of the child
2167365 you will reach the highest position in the knowledge of the prophet and his sunnah the prophets teachings and also you will take precautionary measures and will differentiate between the false and true of sayings of the prophet
2167366 oh abu hanifa you were given life to show my sunnah so leave your loneliness
2167367 the caliph should come over here or we should go to the palace then only the witness would be correct
2167368 the action of all the persons will not be the same
2167369 then why did he sign it when he did not find his presence
2167370 because i know you and i do not want to give you the trouble
2167371 this is not correct and it is against the rules of qaziat justice it is better for you to leave the post of qazi
2167372 i want to tell you one wise thing in this matter that i will try to avoid this post sufyan it is better for you to run away from here and mashair you pretend as a mad man so that shire will become qazi
2167373 one who becomes a judge can be slaughtered without a knife
2167374 i am not eligible for the post of qazi the only logic is that he is not eligible for the post is enough this argument has two points that whether it is true or false if it is true then i am not eligible for it and if it is false then also i am not eligible for the post
2167375 oh caliph a false person is not eligible for the post of qazi to decide the cases of muslims
2167376 oh the leader of muslims how do you know that
2167377 if he would have been legal then he would have felt sorry
2167378 the house owner is his debtor so it is not right to stay in the shadow of his house wall because the prophet has said
2167379 allah says persons like praise of the qualities which are not in them and for this reason they will not be free from the punishment i never sleep in the night from that day so that i may not be from that community
2167380 oh the leader of muslims what is matter if we stretch out our legs in the loneliness
2167381 it is good thing to respect allah in the loneliness also
2167382 oh leader of muslims i am alone if i slip i will control myself but you take care of your legs that may not slip and if it happens then all muslims who follow you will fell down and then it will be the difficult situation to control them
2167383 you are leader of muslims and talking to marry a muslims daughter to an unbeliever i think it is not good
2167384 nothing would happen if you think like this as the prophet married his two daughters to an unbeliever
2167385 if you have discussion with an unbeliever person then keep two things in your mind either you will become an unbeliever or will be away from the religion because if he would say if allah wills your knowledge will guide them and it will be equal to the knowledge that is known when that man would say no then you will become an unbeliever and if he says yes then you will be away from the religion
2167386 he would not consider the miser and his witness due to his miserliness as he will require more and will take more than what he deserves
2167387 you are very kind and great learned man and your generosity is well known to all so what is the reason for such a small amount you were unwilling to give for the construction of mosque
2167388 he was not worried for the amount but he was sure that halal legal amount will not be used for the construction
2167389 you told us that small filth if it is fallen on the dress is permissible but why you have washed small amount of soil
2167390 you are right that is legal opinion fatwa and this is piety or fear of god taqwa as the prophet not permitted bilal to store half bread but he stored food for his wives for the period of one year
2167391 to act upon your knowledge because the knowledge which is not acted upon is like a body without a soul
2167392 he is prophet ibrahim pbuh and on the left side is abu bakr ra
2167393 knows the meaning of what ever knowledge we have and that which we possess with us
2167394 the door of fiqh was closed at that time but allah opened the door through him he also described that he does not know any other person who did such a great favour to the islamic religion
2167395 in the beginning of every century one person will be born and learned persons will get knowledge of religion from him
2167396 during the time of there was no wise person other than him
2167397 even though he is not his follower but he is ahead among all others and due to his great status he is among his admirers
2167398 he saw the prophet in his dream and prophet asked him who are you boy he replied him that he is a person of his ummat followers then the prophet called him near put his saliva in his mouth and told him to go he told allah will grant his mercy and blessing on him
2167399 have you got any chance for doing any sin even though you had power of doing it but due to the fear of allah you escaped from it
2167400 yes i got many chances but i was always away from such sins
2167401 after determination of sin any person who avoids it due to fear of allah then his dwelling will be in the heaven
2167402 who is the owner of this money and for whom this money was sent for distribution
2167403 it was good that the person was in baghdad if that person would have been in rome then all the romans would have accepted the religion of islam
2167404 these lights are especially for the harem so it is not good for me to use it for reading
2167405 many learned persons are interested in interpretation he considers them as they do not know anything
2167406 he is slave of such persons who taught him good manners
2167407 one who teaches knowledge to a foolish person spoils the rights of knowledge one should teach knowledge to such person who is capable of it
2167408 if they sell the world for a piece of bread without knowing its worth then they are not the right ones
2167409 do not try to accumulate wealth like others do but try to compete them in spiritual and moral aspects try to be a great worshipper of allah they will not get any benefit from their wealth whereas you will be benefited more because of allahs blessings their wealth will remain here in the world they will not carry this to their grave on the contrary the reward of worship to allah will help you to remain pious we all will die one day let us worship allah to have a pious soul
2167410 i got my lost time so you also listen it carefully what they are telling
2167411 i do not have complete knowledge of the world and my knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of mystic persons and mystic persons knowledge is not equal to their teachers one advice in which he told them that the present time is like a cutting sword
2167412 we have taught adam a s the names of all things
2167413 he was given a golden chair and pearls which were showered upon him allah gave him 700 000 dinars and granted his grace he
2167414 he was better than me because i tried for right food for myself but he struggled for his entire family
2167415 at the time of his death he was free from all the false accusations of mutazala
2167416 what is your opinion about those enemies who gave you such severe punishments
2167417 they think that i am not on the right path so all the hardships were given to me for the sake of allah on the day of judgement i will not ask any revenge for those enemies
2167418 allah has blessed him because in his life he paid respect to imam hanbal
2167419 oh imam hanbal you have no faith in allah so you are giving me food like allah but actually you are away from the way
2167420 he is our dear friend but if he wants to ruin the entire world then i can do the same so you should be grateful for meeting such a great friend of mine but after this you will not see him again
2167421 do not sit with a person even if he possesses a silver collyrium
2167422 because i thought that after meeting him it will be difficult for me to get apart from him due to his politeness so i decided to meet him at a place from where i may not be separated from him
2167423 i asked allah for his fear so allah gave me too much fear and for this reason there was fear for the loss of wisdom
2167424 allah told me that i can come near him due to the reading of quran
2167425 to keep away from the difficulties of action is called sincerity
2167426 to hand over all the affairs to allah is called pleasure
2167427 for the general persons asceticism is to keep away from haram illegal things and for the pious persons asceticism is to desire for more and more halal legal things to keep themselves away from all the things which keeps away a man from allah this is asceticism of mystic persons
2167428 they are mistaken because the knowledge caused them to sit in the mosques
2167429 there is no group in the world which is not seeking for the livelihood
2167430 there is no time to reply so pray for me to end my life with faith in allah because the satan is telling me that anybody who leaves the world with faith is most sorrowful thing for him so i am not confident till my last moment of life that i will leave this world with faith in allah oh allah bless me
2167431 oh allah do not take back faith from the believers
2167432 in his lifetime he has faced many hardships and punishments for not saying quran as creature due to this reason allah blessed him and allah gave him great rewards allah asked me to recite the prayer which sufyan thauri taught me and i recited that prayer there
2167433 oh allah every thing is in your control and you are having command of all the things with you so allow me these things and do not ask what i need
2167434 his highness now there is no other way except to surrender ourselves to the enemy
2167435 no for me the tigers life of one minute is better than the jackals life of 1000 years
2167436 now i got the correct information about tipu sultan that his dead body is there in front of north gate of the fort under the pile of other dead bodies so please follow me upto there
2167437 yes she is an orphan hindu girl and her father was died in the last war the sultan had adopted her as his daughter
2167438 i do not know about her may be she belongs to the royal family
2167439 we are his murders and not all of you we had murdered him and our coming generations will put flowers of respect on his grave

2167445 princess resurrection a very cool supernatural series about a young boy who finds himself in the service of a aristocratic woman who fights demons the anime is airing on
2167446 looking back at my previous works i am confident to say i am better at this now
2167447 life in flesh may soon for me end i know then a better life begins
2167448 ive known chad for a long time hes been a good pal of mine i know hell bounce back on his feet wherever he goes hes going to have a good shot at playing and playing well
2167449 we play the underdog role really well we like playing in the shadows if we get overlooked a little thats good for us
2167450 its essentially a regular piece of paper but its made in a very intelligent way
2167451 were not putting pieces together its a single integrated device
2167452 the components are molecularly attached to each other the carbon nanotube print is embedded in the paper and the electrolyte is soaked into the paper the end result is a device that looks feels and weighs the same as paper
2167453 this lack of water allows the paper energy storage devices to withstand extreme temperatures
2167454 plus because of the high paper content and lack of toxic chemicals its environmentally safe
2167455 its a way to power a small device such as a pacemaker without introducing any harsh chemicals such as the kind that are typically found in batteries into the body
2167456 when we get this technology down well basically have the ability to print batteries and print supercapacitors
2167457 we see this as a technology thats just right for the current energy market as well as the electronics industry which is always looking for smaller lighter power sources our device could make its way into any number of different applications
2167458 but i think what people would have to realize about miami is where we are right now were trying to build this team preferably with young players that all could maybe grow up together
2167459 i thanked him for his loyalty and his work and everything hes done for us
2167460 from what ive heard about him ive only heard that hes a very intelligent player and hes always been pretty accurate with what he did with the ball i know the guys a competitor
2167461 we have three quarterbacks right now on our team and were finding it hard right now to get all three of those guys the work they need im happy with the people we have here right now
2167462 our results strongly suggest that deep traps are formed in plastic semiconductors by a charge induced chemical reaction
2167463 these traps were not there in the uncharged pristine material
2167464 would allow government agencies to somehow deputize a private individual or entity such that any statements a person makes to the private entity would be covered by a privilege
2167465 for a variety of reasons extending the use of absolute privilege under these circumstances could be potentially dangerous and lead to abuse
2167466 you need to be focused on your own race and dont even think about him
2167467 the olympics is not going to be easy for anyone even phelps everyone is trying to win an olympic medal
2167468 obviously i have a huge amount of respect for the guy
2167469 but im not going to think hes michael phelps and hes going to beat me to a pulp thats not the sort of attitude that gets you into the olympics
2167470 everybody talks about phelps but i will just go and swim my best
2167471 i feel i can win the 400 im thats what im going out there to do its going to be a close race its going to be a big battle its a great way to start the olympics
2167472 we want to see what happens when the propellers get to the scale where its impossible to reduce the size of the blades any more
2167473 pumping rates and efficiencies in the hydrophilic and hydrophobic forms can differ by an order of magnitude which was not expected
2167474 in principle we could even attach some biological molecules to the blades and form a propeller that would work only if other molecules bio compatible with the blades are in the pumped solution
2167475 does that mean you are done painting and i get the keys
2167476 nope just need to get the lease and deposit so i know i have a tenent

2167492 while there is nothing wrong with businesses or individuals promoting their personal agendas before the state legislature they should do so honestly
2167493 tlrs policy agenda which includes taking away the right of texans to elect their judges and protecting negligent liquor store owners from being held accountable when they serve intoxicated customers is not reflective of the views of ordinary citizens we urge texans for lawsuit reform to end their fraudulent claims of being a grassroots organization and to stop lying to texas voters about who they really represent

2167544 it is critical to detect mercury quickly accurately and at its source
2167545 most existing detection methods require expensive complicated equipment forcing tests to take place in a lab our method is simpler faster and more convenient than conventional methods and results can be read with the naked eye at the point of use
2167546 to the best of my knowledge we have set a record for the most sensitive colorimetric sensor
2167547 a glucose meter for example operates at a high micromolar scale with glucose being 100 000 times more concentrated than the mercury we are detecting
2167548 when mercury binds to the t t mismatch site it is like adding some superglue the gold nanoparticles are now held together even more tightly
2167549 the mercury creates a stronger bond that requires a higher temperature to break apart the dna strands
2167550 our measurements show that cooper pairs survive in local patches of the material at temperatures far above the critical temperature
2167551 within these tiny regions there are particular arrangements of atoms that favor formation of electron pairs at very high temperatures these patches are a precursor to superconductivity and important to enhancing it
2167552 in lower temperature superconductors electrons pair up and form a superfluid at the critical temperature end of story
2167553 in ceramics however our team is finding that electron pairing occurs over a wide range of temperatures and their pairing is a function of highly localized chemistry in the sample often in patches only a few atoms wide
2167554 we spent about two and a half years looking at many different samples at different temperatures to decipher the story
2167555 we were motivated to search for pairing at high temperatures because of the work of others most notably that of my colleague phuan ong
2167556 this type of precision experiment performed while varying temperature gives us a new window into the complex problem of ceramic superconductors
2167557 if we can figure out the details of what is happening at these local patches within the samples it might be possible to construct a material that performs better overall

2167690 sabes cual es la verdad que se esconde tras la historia de la muchacha y la serpiente
2167691 que muchas veces hay que arriesgarse si se quieren conseguir las cosas que uno anhela y que en ocasiones est n tras una apariencia ruda o peligrosa como una serpiente o como este zarzal igual que nosotros ahora arriesgamos a llevar un pinchazo para recoger estas dulces moras que nos comemos y que llevaremos a tu madre que sabes que le encantan

2167902 at gibeon the lord appeared to solomon during the night in a dream and god said ask for whatever you want me to give you
2167903 solomon answered you have shown great kindness to your servant my father david because he was faithful to you and righteous and upright in heart
2167904 since you have asked for this and not for long life or wealth for yourself nor have asked for the death of your enemies but for discernment in administering justice i will do what you have asked i will give you a wise and discerning heart so that there will never have been anyone like you nor will there ever be moreover i will give you what you have not asked for both riches and honor so that in your lifetime you will have no equal among kings and if you walk in my ways and obey my statutes and commands as david your father did i will give you a long life then solomon awoke and he realized it had been a dream

2167916 during the long period when we were cut off from the missionaries we had a remarkable visitation from the spirit of god the pastors of our district had been fasting and praying because of the bloodshed and persecution we were praying and the spirit descended on us in a wonderful way and his gifts operated among us he told us many things in prophecy which have all come true the holy spirit began to convict us of sin as we went back to our churches to preach the streams of men and women believed on the lord jesus and confessed their sins exactly as in acts 19 17 20 bringing their heathen charms the revival lasted eight months

2168000 therefore if you died with christ from the basic principles of the world why as though living in the world do you subject yourselves to regulations do not touch do not taste do not handle which all concern things which perish with the using according to the commandments and doctrines of men these things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self imposed religion false humility and neglect of the body but are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh
2168001 but he who was of the bondwoman was born according to the flesh and he of the freewoman through promise which things are symbolic for these are the two covenants the one from mount sinai which gives birth to bondage which is hagar
2168002 but the jerusalem above is free which is the mother of us all
2168003 nevertheless what does the scriptures say cast out the bondwoman and her son for the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son of the free woman so then brethren we are not children of the bondwoman but of the free
2168004 but each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desire and enticed then when desire has conceived it gives birth to sin and sin when it is full grown brings forth death
2168005 abide in me and i in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine neither can you unless you abide in me i am the vine you are the branches he who abides in me and i in him bears much fruit for without me you can do nothing
2168006 even so every good tree bears good fruit but a bad tree bears bad fruit a good tree cannot bear bad fruit nor can a bad tree bear good fruit every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire therefore by their fruits you will know them
2168007 you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free
2168008 therefore if the son makes you free you shall be free indeed
2168009 i know that you are abrahams descendants but you seek to kill me because my word has no place
2168010 then they said to him we were not born of fornication we have one father god jesus said to them if god were your father you would love me for i proceeded forth and came from god nor have i come of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech because you are not able to listen to my word you are of your father the devil and the desires of your father you want to do he was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaks a lie he speaks from his own resources for he is a liar and the father of it

2168012 there is a separation now beginning a separation of the sheep and the goats matthew 25 32 33 there are herdsmen who have been trying to drive my sheep in the wrong direction
2168013 the herdsmen are unclean spirits imposters of the truth the herdsmen are those spirits that are the driving force behind those who have the appearance of godliness but deny the power 2 timothy 3 5 the power of godliness is the transforming power of the holy spirit that is able to transform the heart and renew the mind
2168014 but the hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father is seeking such to worship him god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth

2168017 common sense questions a church of christ preacher cannot answer
2168018 how can some say there are too many children thats like saying there are too many flowers
2168019 well isnt that the whole point that whole era was messy then
2168020 statement first then question i recently stepped down from worship at our church i couldnt get along with the worship pastor at all he had no vision for us to go or grow he was stuck in the 80s and 90s and he had nothing to teach the other worship leaders after numerous meetings and suggestions on things to do i gave up and decided for the best of everyone that i remove myself from the situation well 3 days letter he decided that he isnt the one to continue after 6 years leading the church into this new direction were headed the pastor has been trying to get the guy to step down for 2 years too so its good for everyone now the senior pastor has decided that in this transition time he will oversee the worship ministry which is fine although scary but he wants to turn the worship into specific teams operating together instead of the random rotation weve been doing so what he wants to do is stick all the worship leaders in one room we had 4 including me and the worship pastor but the senior pastor has added 2 more and the worship pastor has decided hed like to continue at least leading so that makes 5 worship leaders not including me because i stepped down so the senior pastor wants to stick the 5 worship leaders in a room with himself and hash out 5 seperate teams so that way the senior pastor only has to schedule worship leaders and not musicians hopefully thats clear as mud so now the question what are your thoughts on specific teams for worship where you always play with the same people more info the old worship pastor let anybody on the stage so we have brutal drummers who shouldnt even be allowed to hold chopsticks and singers who constantly break even the plastic communion cups when singing thats a little dramatic of course i told the senior pastor what he needs to do is disband the entire worship ministry bring in a new worship pastor and then let that guy start from scratch where people have to do auditions and all that
2168021 we are not obliged to give people a place to play or use whatever musical talents they think they might have instead we are obliged to do whats best for the church as a whole by putting on stage the right people at the right time

2168049 well i take a few things into consideration when making my choice
2168050 i usually choose the medium sized ones and look at the stem end to determine when it was harvested if it was cut from the vine and has a long green stem that means it was harvested early so it is not vine ripened if the stem has dried up and fallen off or is loose enough to gently pull away from the melon than its probably ripe i look for the ones that have a clean divot like that one see where the stem used to be then i press on the divot to see if it yields a bit to the pressure which is a good sign oh and when most melons are fragrant theyre ripe

2168052 the hvac industry is dynamic and sensitive to changing market trends particularly changes in the volume of new construction
2168053 hvac in gwinnett is losing the stability that comes with new construction because the housing market is experiencing a slowdown the real story is how successful companies adapt to changing conditions to maintain profitability
2168054 this is a slowdown to a previous record pace setting 10 plus years of new construction in this region
2168055 housing is slowing but not nearly as bad as current perception the slowdown in production is due to builders being cautious and not overextending themselves with more than 12 months inventory
2168056 although we are experiencing a shift that we havent seen in awhile
2168057 the industry is adapting to the slowdown in new construction well since mingledorffs is a large distributor we can adjust inventory and staffing levels as needed to meet supply and demand however the independent contractor and installer level is more challenging as they often dont specialize in both new construction and maintenance and repair

2168099 the ancients were told you shall not commit murder and whoever commits murder shall be liable to the court but i say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the court and whoever shall say to his brother raca shall be guilty before the supreme court and whoever shall say you fool shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell
2168100 if therefore you are presenting your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you leave your offering there before the altar and go your way first be reconciled to your brother and then come and present your offering

2168110 the mind of the fathers is an intrinsic term of reference in orthodox theology no less than the word of holy scripture and indeed never separated emphasis ours from it
2168111 by what authority can we identify christian truth both as scripture and tradition
2168112 first the word of god laid down in holy scripture secondly the definitions of the councils thirdly the liturgical texts and lastly the writings of the fathers
2168113 the measure and the criterion of the presence and action of god through the church as well as of the genuineness of the penetration of the wishes and the pursuits of the human spirit by the true knowledge
2168114 lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner
2168115 man is called to partake vitally of the divine energy this is real not a hyperbolic manner of speech it spells nothing less than the conformity of the saints with christ
2168116 tends to restrict or limit the churchs spiritual authority to the first eight centuries
2168117 the church is still fully authoritative as she has been in the ages past
2168118 one does not remain in this tradition by a certain historical inertia by keeping as a tradition received from the fathers all that which by force of habit flatters a certain devout sensibility on the contrary it is by substituting this sort of traditions for the tradition of the holy spirit living in the church that one runs the most risk of finding oneself finally outside the body of christ

2168145 the reason that being the best in the world is worth so much is that few can do it scarcity carries a premium the dip is the long slog between starting and mastery a long slog thats actually a shortcut because it gets you where you want to go faster than any other path the dip is the long stretch between beginners luck and real accomplishment the dip is the set of artificial screens set up to keep people like you out
2168146 the way you become the best in the world is by quitting the stuff where you cant be the best that leaves you the resources to invest in getting through the dip its that simple quit the dead ends and invest in the dips
2168147 can you do everything of course not breadth isnt the point the point is that in a world of infinite choice in a world where the best in the world is worth more every single day the only chance youve got is to find a dip and embrace it realize that its actually your best ally the harder it is to get through the better your chance of being the only one to get through it sticking with something just so you can be mediocre at it doesnt make a lot of sense to me
2168148 everything should be as simple as possible but not simpler than that
2168149 no amount of observations of white swans can allow the inference that all swans are white but the single observation of a single black swan is sufficient to refute that conclusion

2168152 the fact that the poor are alive is clear proof of their ability they do not need us to teach them how to survive they already know how to do this so rather than waste our time teaching them new skills we try to make maximum use of their existing skills
2168153 when we want to help the poor we usually offer them charity but charity is no solution to poverty charity only perpetuates poverty by taking the initiative away from the poor charity appeases our conscience
2168154 we have created a slavery free world a smallpox free world an apartheid free world creating a poverty free world would be greater than all these accomplishments while at the same time reinforcing them
2168155 how do historians know about events which according to them occurred before there were spaniards in the philippines while there are almost no known authentic written documents from that era much of what we know about the pre hispanic era came to us through legends these are stories that were not written but were spoken by each generation to the following generation legends change with each telling because often the tellers memory is weak or mistaken or the teller just wants to make additions to the story to spice it up legends are usually nothing more than stories about the creation of the world the first man and woman and such it is easy to see that they are not meant to be regarded as fact however there are some legends which do contain a kernel of truth
2168156 jose e marcos contributions to philippine historiography appear to be deliberate fabrications with no historic validity there is therefore no present evidence that any filipino ruler by the name of kalantiaw ever existed or that the kalantiaw penal code is any older than 1914
2168157 oral tradition relates that boholano pioneers founded the town of moalboal
2168158 the first boholano to settle in the town was laurente sabanal
2168159 in search for a better place to live in a family from cabalian leyte crossed the visayan sea to a nearby island and they became the nucleus of a settlement in cebu which grew into a town
2168160 the inhabitants prosperous as they were were objects of forays by moro pirates
2168161 huluyaw was the former name of ronda the name may have come from the name of a banana plant huluyaw which grew abundantly along the banks of the settlement it could have originated also according to a popular legend from incidents when pirates from
2168162 badian is a town well sheltered from natural elements like typhoons and floods it has high mountains protecting it and it is located on elevated spot the strategic position also served the people as protection from moro raids during the olden times
2168163 as was a practice of early inhabitants to associate and subsequently name their place after a plant or animal or a natural formation
2168164 badian was the site of a number of historic battles
2168165 bulwarte a historic landmark still stands as a mute testimony to the courage of the early inhabitants of aloguinsan
2168166 one night it was a full moon and the winds were favorable the muslim invaders approached the village with old people women and children safe behind the hills the men began firing their cannons and did not stop until the pirates were annihilated it was the end of moro assaults
2168167 the historic hill of villona between the barrios of olango and cawasan was also the site of a battle between the american forces and filipino revolutionists
2168168 after due preparation an expeditionary force under the command of captain juan de chaves landed at zamboanga on april 6 1635
2168169 after captain de chaves force of 300 well armed spaniards and 1000 visayans had cleared the peninsula temporarily of hostile moros the construction of one of the finest forts in the east was put into execution on june 23 1635 the foundations of the grand fortress of nuestra senora del pilar was laid by father vera engineer of the spanish army
2168170 the forces which he had were five companies his own of 150 men those of captain nicholas gonzalez and lorenzo orella de ugalde of 100 men each another company of sailors another of pampangos all the rest were rabble and pioneers the same day he reached the river he entered with seventy men the court of correlat defended by more than two thousand armed moros
2168171 a decree dated december 21 1751 was signed by the governor general of manila it provided the extermination of the moslems of mindanao and sulu with fire and sword and no quarter for moros of any age or either sex the fitting out of visayan corsairs with authority to extinguish the foe to accomplish the burning of all that was combustible to destroy all crops desolate all land make moro captives and recover christian slaves one fifth of the spoil taken from the moros belong to the king all visayans engaged to be exempt from the payment of all tribute while engaged in the extermination of the moros criminals who volunteer to the service to be granted full pardon for past offenses
2168172 indeed matters reached such a state that before the end of the year warships were ordered out for another attack on jolo
2168173 in the battle of jolo father ibanez lost his life in the assault on a moro cotta the good father tucked his cassock about his waist and plunged into the thickest of the battle the cebuanoes sic performed prodigies of valor and jolo fell again the seat of the sultanate was removed across the island to maybun and the moros paid regular visits to jolo to slaughter the spanish garrison which remained
2168174 that year of 1634 was so quiet and so barren of events worthy of remembrance that i shall not dwell long upon it for there is nothing of which i have heard to detain me unless it be the raid of the mindanao enemy into the island of leyte and the depredations that they committed there with the license permitted to them in seeing that there was no attempt made in manila to check them
2168175 on sunday december 3 1634 the mindanaos arrived with eighteen galleys at the village of ogmuc ormoc city leaving behind in that of baybay the rest of the vessels which they brought in their fleet
2168176 they planted three pieces in a convenient place at the church in order to do great damage to those in the fort and firing without cessation they did not allow our men to fire a shot through its loopholes and windows
2168177 they were all captured and a great contest arose among the enemy as to who should have father carpio as his captive
2168178 from that place they sailed out and committed the same destruction in the villages of soyor bin ang n cabali n canamuc n and baybay leyte island but they were so stoutly resisted in the village of iniba g n
2168179 the camucones the name of the moro pirates who inhabit the little islands of the sulu group east of tawi tawi and the islands between these and borneo also a people from islands subject to borney cruel and barbarous and mahometan by religion although there are pagans in some islands made their raids into the island of panay chiefly on the villages of bat n domayan and mahanlur and in those of bahay where they captured many of our indians and burned the churches of the visita
2168180 the camucones entered that sea with the intention of lying in wait for some capture but when they least expected it they found their craft on dry ground an indian who was gathering the aforesaid shellfish saw them and recognizing them to be piratical enemies by the style of their craft went to the village and gave warning of them many of the inhabitants of bat n assembled and well armed attacked the camucones very courageously they made a great slaughter of the pirates and captured many of them and burned their craft some of the camucones escaped through the mangrove plantations and swampy ground they were captured next day with the exception of those who had the luck to rejoin the boats of their companions who repenting of their carelessness returned to their lands and did not return to try their fortune in those regions for many years

2168186 arnisadores prefer teachers who shine by their own light like the sun rather than the planets that shine by the reflected light of their school or teacher
2168187 incidentally masters from the north are more apt to be self deprecating while masters from the south are more prone to boast this is due to social convention and personal dynamics and has little to do with actual ability but in the country of hard sell this could be one reason why arnis from the south is spreading throughout the world while arnis from the north remains in the shadows
2168188 legends claim that ten datus chieftains left borneo and settled in panay where they established the bothoan in the twelfth century the bothoan was a school where the datus taught kali along with academic subjects and agriculture it was a kind of preparatory school for tribal leaders
2168189 so how do we tell what is true and what is false in philippine history
2168190 as time goes on more and more exceptions to the rule of thumb will arise due to the efforts of the increasing number of new historians who desire to correct the lies that were taught to filipinos in the past

2168208 kami melakukan upa upa guna membangkitkan kembali semangat pak wahab yang mungkin sempat terkejut sewaktu massa pendukung protap datang dan memaksanya menandatangani surat rekomendasi pembentukan protap
2168209 kalau ada masyarakat yang berunjuk rasa meminta pembentukan protap kita teruskan kalau ada juga yang berunjuk rasa menolak pembentukan protap ya kita teruskan juga karena memang itulah tugas dewan di sumut menyampaikan aspirasi masyarakat kepada pemerintah pusat selanjutnya terserah kepada pemerintah
2168210 mengapa saat kami yang berunjuk rasa pengawalan tampak diperketat bahkan aparat sampai membentuk pagar betis segala
2168211 jadi kalau tidak melalui paripurna rekomendasi protap itu tak sah meskipun itu sudah ditandatangani ketua dprd sumut h abdul wahab dalimunthe sh
2168212 saya melihat pak wahab cukup bijak menandatangani rekomendasi mendukung protap dan yang menolak seandainya itu tak dilakukan tentu dikhawatirkan akan terjadi anarkis lebih besar
2168213 yang jelas apa yang telah ditempuh ketua dprd sumut itu menerima atau menolak protap saat massa demo di dewan itu sudah tepat tapi sekali lagi itu belum sah karena harus ada mekanismenya yakni melalui paripurna dewan dulu
2168214 beda pendapat itu hal yang wajar tapi jangan sampai situasi kamtibmas yang aman dan kondusif di sumut ini tercoreng hanya karena masalah protap
2168215 kita telah memeriksa pendemonstrasi yang tergolong beringas di kantor dprd sumut beberapa waktu lalu sebanyak 14 saksi sudah diperiksa dan satu diantaranya telah menjadi tersangka
2168216 kita sudah surati koordinator aksi pendukung protap tersebut untuk dimintai kesaksiannya namun mereka sampai saat ini belum hadir alasan ketidakhadirannya sampai sejauh ini kita belum jelas
2168217 pokoknya yang telah menjadi tersangka adalah salah satu mahasiswa universitas di medan sedangkan asal usulnya tidak berasal dari daerah kota medan
2168218 jika bukti cukup kuat tersangka pengrusakan kantor dewan akan kita jemput langsung di kediamannya

2168225 kalau pelayanan masih pilih kasih dikhawatirkan penumpang akan berpindah ke maskapai penerbangan lain
2168226 sanksi tegas itu penting dilakukan agar kasus serupa tak terulang lagi
2168227 saya memang belum ada menerima keluhan penumpang saat pemeriksaan boarding pass yang disesuaikan dengan ktp walau demikian saya akan cek dulu

2168263 i want to grow to be the tallest and straightest tree in the forest people will see me on top of the hill and look up to my branches and think of the heavens and god and how close to them i am reaching i will be the greatest tree of all time and people will always remember me

2168267 as for fasts vigils prayer and almsgiving and other good works done in the name of christ they are only the means of acquiring the holy spirit of god
2168268 however good they may be in themselves certainly do not constitute the aim of our christian life
2168269 i cant help but worship the one whom i am extremely overwhelmingly in love with
2168270 my soul thirsts for you my flesh longs for you in a dry and thirsty land where there is no water
2168271 but the flesh crucified and i want him to live his life through me
2168272 oh i remember the days lord when you promised me i want to see those days god
2168273 my counsel shall stand and i will do my pleasure

2168281 the entire mountain nature the peak of athos the monasteries forests and rocks had all been filled with joyful light and imbued with heavenly beauty the mountain was invisibly revealing itself as being indeed holy it was apparent that the holiness in its name was something inseparable from its very physical substance and you felt that if it could be crumbled like a clump of earth then from this very dirt would come forth a dazzling light the very same fragrance which had filled the universe on the day of resurrection the souls of the saints fly and flutter about luminous and full of light the relics of the saints emit the same uncreated and scintillating light an indescribable and uncreated fragrance pours out from their tombs everything around is filled by the beauty of contrition and the fragrance of heaven
2168282 no true evangelical is troubled by thoughts we are trained to have our minds permanently set on heavenly things thoughts are flesh and blood in origin however temptations have a satanic and demonic source we are all tempted but when we are tempted we are strengthened to overcome and be overcomers
2168283 our present system is outdated ineffective and unsustainable but we know we can spend far less and create an efficient high quality health care system for all americans

2168285 since sales taxes are regressive taking more in percentage terms from the incomes of the poor and middle class than the rich some provision is needed to prevent a vast increase in taxation on the nonwealthy the fairtax does this by sending monthly checks to every household based on income
2168286 the federal government would have to pay taxes to itself on all of its purchases of goods and services thus if the defense department buys a tank that now costs 1 million the manufacturer would have to add the fairtax and send it to the treasury department the tank would then cost the federal government 300 000 more than it does today but its tax collection will also be 300 000 higher
2168287 the proposal only works if federal purchases are cut by 30 close to 300 billion the increased cost imposed by the fairtax
2168288 what possible incentive would the states have to be vigorous in their federal tax collections what is to stop them from slacking off and giving their citizens a tax cut at federal expense what about states with no sales taxes whats to stop people from bypassing retail outlets and buying their goods from producers or at wholesale tax free
2168289 the biggest deception in the fairtax however is its promise to relieve individuals from having to file income tax returns keep extensive financial records and potentially suffer audits making april 15 just another day yet all but six states now have state income taxes so unless one lives in one of those states this promise is an empty one indeed
2168290 in short the fairtax is too good to be true and voters should not take seriously any candidate who supports it

2168530 why should we believe the government will enforce them now
2168531 theres nothing we can do with them the feds wont come get them and the aclu gives us hell if we hold them
2168532 our politicians are so busy pandering for potential votes that they are giving away our country
2168533 una mostra che guarda al futuro ma non al passato
2168534 questa mostra spiega inoltre robert storr non si basa su una proposta ideologica o teorica onnicomprensiva piuttosto si fonda su un atteggiamento di base nei confronti dellarte rivolto a supporre che le dicotomie analitiche tra il percettivo e il concettuale tra pensiero e sentimento piacere e dolore intuizione e riflessione critica troppo spesso oscurano o negano la presenza complessa di tutti questi fattori nella nostra esperienza del mondo nonch la presenza di tutte queste dimensioni nellarte che ne deriva ogni opera sar l a parlare per s insieme le corrispondenze tra le opere che siano esse armoniose o dissonanti solleciteranno lattenzione del pubblico io credo verso la diversit di emozioni materiali temi e modi di coinvolgere il visitatore che caratterizzano opere darte create in linguaggi diversi e tutti ci nondimeno coniugati al presente

2168555 usaha kecil dan menengah merupakan salah satu kekuatan pendorong terdepan dalam pembangunan ekonomi gerakan sektor ukm amat vital untuk menciptakan pertumbuhan dan lapangan pekerjaan ukm cukup fleksibel dan dapat dengan mudah beradaptasi dengan pasang surut dan arah permintaan pasar mereka juga menciptakan lapangan pekerjaan lebih cepat dibandingkan sektor usaha lainnya dan mereka juga cukup terdiversifikasi dan memberikan kontribusi penting dalam ekspor dan perdagangan karena itu ukm merupakan aspek penting sdalam pembangunan ekonomi yang komprehensif di indonesia sumber kehidupan amat bergantung pada sektor ukm kebanyakan usaha kecil ini terkonsentrasi pada sektor perdagangan pangan olahan pangan tekstil dan garmen kayu dan produk kayu serta produksi mineral non logam mereka bergerak dalam kondisi yang amat kompetitif dan ketidakpastian juga amat dipengaruhi oleh situasi ekonomi makro lingkungan usaha yang buruk lebih banyak merugikan ukm daripada usaha besar

2168557 we expect to reach the larger population in the western portion of the state with our new presence in wilkins
2168558 we made adequate yearly progress this year and 91 percent of our families graded us with an a or a b in school quality and customer satisfaction so we believe we are well positioned to continue to grow and work with families throughout the western portions of pennsylvania
2168559 there are many reasons families choose cyber schools over the traditional bricks and mortar schools
2168560 we offer a more flexible course of studies we offer flexibility in the time students are able to attend school for example if students prefer to do assignments in the evening they may attend our school at their convenience
2168561 we offer a violence and drug free environment and we offer opportunities for families to structure their childs educational program around the needs of the family in short we offer a choice which is our strongest asset
2168562 we constantly hear districts say kids are being pulled from them
2168563 the charter school movement is about choice ive never gone to a student and said you have to come here they come by choice
2168564 parents will always retain the right to choose how and where they wish their children to become educated
2168565 no matter what educational facility is welcomed into our community the gateway school district will continue to provide its students with the best possible education so that they can thrive in our ever changing diverse world
2168566 the district has grown and the administration has outgrown the current facility administrators are crammed into small office space we have to store boxes of supplies in hallways
2168567 our main conference room where the board meets holds only 47 people if a big issue pops up and draws a large crowd we must move the meeting to the high school auditorium also the board does not have a room to conduct executive sessions in private
2168568 the estimated price tag was too high it cost 1 9 million to build the maintenance facility here were talking expansion
2168569 i sensed there would be a backlash from taxpayers if we didnt consider other and hopefully cheaper options
2168570 we received several phone calls from the public expressing concern about a 2 million price tag for an expansion
2168571 board and administration will review the proposals and consider the scope of the expansion required we could have a decision by the aug 18 voting meeting
2168572 shes a tiny little thing just a real tender heart quiet and gentle
2168573 i would get down on the floor with him and say what if grandma cried like that until he laughed
2168574 the lamp is woven into the fabric of the norwin community
2168575 every time workers appear and doors are open folks and kids walking by stop to watch theyre hoping the theater finally will reopen
2168576 actually kcs donated the lamp theater to the trust for 1 because it is vital to the revitalization project
2168577 its easier for the trust to secure community development grants than a private business
2168578 most people including potential investors who promised to help with funding have disappeared commercial money is tight these days all we can do is hope things will work out
2168579 considering the countrys fiscal crisis nobody can realistically set a timetable for the lamp to reopen but if we can get the right funding to finish most of the restoration im optimistic the lamp could reopen by late fall
2168580 s amp t bank intends to honor irwin banks commitments to the irwin project and community development in the norwin area
2168581 s amp t bank will continue to be sensitive to efforts encouraging economic development in the norwin community and surrounding areas
2168582 the lamp theater is essential to the revitalization of downtown irwin especially the business district
2168583 normally we have a pretty good relationship with the allegheny county housing authority police
2168584 we have any problems we notify them and they take care of it its just one happened to sneak by them
2168585 running 5 000 some units for people 18 years and older who has the manpower and resources to run people over and over again
2168586 and when do you stop do you run them once a month once a year
2168587 in a utopian situation it seems like the right thing to do but the more i see how broken things are i hesitate to advocate for any funding for this program
2168588 for all the cons there are a lot of pros for having section 8 because we police it
2168589 the private sector isnt bound by provisions like the department of housing and urban development is
2168590 the rest of the stores are very solid right now

2168597 for god so loved the world that he gave his one and only son that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life
2168598 not everyone who says to me lord lord will enter the kingdom of heaven
2168599 because judgment without mercy will be shown to anyone who has not been merciful
2168600 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of god
2168601 that if you confess with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart that god raised him from the dead you will be saved

2168608 although this table may look nice enough itll actually drive any two people attempting to enjoy a quiet dinner crazy why each setting plates forks spoons glasses is tethered to the opposite so if one person uses the glass the other cant pick up theirs talk about coordination
2168609 i have been waiting for this day for so long i cant believe that its happening a ceasefire today we should celebrate
2168610 now i hope that the us and israel have no further excuses to cut aid to palestinians we hope this agreement will end this grave situation and our suffering
2168611 we will keep hoping and we congratulate both parties and encourage them not to let enemies destroy them as all our bodies suffer the same pain
2168612 will unify our ranks there is a commitment and unity we will preserve this partnership
2168613 i tell those who fear that the fate of this agreement will be the same fate of the old ones we have pledged our allegiance to god at this sacred place and we will go back to our country fully committed to it
2168614 respect international resolutions and the agreements signed by the palestine liberation organization
2168615 the us position on hamas hasnt changed its an armed terrorist organization and that places restrictions on us activities and us engagement
2168616 sebelumnya tersangka ditangkap petugas sewaktu melakukan bentrok di kampus uisu pada saat diamankan ke 4 tersangka memiliki senjata tajam
2168617 tapi kita hanya mengamankan sedangkan yang memriksa dan menyidik perkara tersebut poldasu yang menanganinya
2168618 yang kami lakukan bukan penyerangan tetapi merupakan upaya pengusiran para preman yang sejak enam bulan terakhir menguasai dan menduduki kampus uisu
2168619 lalu pihak dirjen dikti menginstruksikan kepada kopertis wil i nad sumut untuk menyosialisasikan bahwa yayasan uisu yang legal adalah pimpinan hj syariani as nah atas alas hak itu kami memulihkan keadaan kampus yang centang prenang dari penguasan preman preman yang bercokol di kampus
2168620 upaya persuasif kepada aparat kepolisian juga terus kita lakukan agar pengambilalihan kampus mendapat dukungan pada prinsipnya mereka mendukung tapi hanya sebatas pengamanan dari hal hal yang tak diinginkan dengan melakukan pengamanan di luar kampus
2168621 pengusiran kami lakukan lewat cara cara legal sekuriti yang kita sewa adalah satpam terlatih memiliki identitas resmi dan mengantongi surat tugas jadi yang mengusir seratusan preman di uisu murni dilakukan para satpam
2168622 justru ketika petugas sekuriti mulai masuk kampus mereka melihat banyak sepeda motor yang telah terbakar dan juga sebagian gedung gedung sudah hancur duluan ini dilakukan preman dengan modus seolah olah petugas sekuriti yang melakukan
2168623 jadi unjuk rasa itu tidak mewakili 15 ribu mahasiswa uisu
2168624 kalau mereka sadar hukum apalagi yayasan mereka tidak diakui dirjen ahu mengapa mereka membuat kebijakan kebijakan administrasi di uisu kalau mereka sadar hukum dan juga tidak diakui dirjen dikti mereka seharusnya ke luar dari kampus soal menunggu proses pengadilan putusannya bisa memakan waktu paling cepat 3 tahun ini bisa merugikan mahasiswa dan uisu ke depan
2168625 saat terjadi pengambilalihan kampus oleh para preman yang disewa yayasanuisu pimpinan helmi nasution kami terpaksa keluar namun setelah legalitas yayasan uisu pimpinan hj sariani as diakui dirjen ahu depkum ham ri kami mengambil alih lagi kampus
2168626 kami mengumumkan bahwa kami akan mengambil alih kampus pada tanggal 9 mei kami mencoba bersikap persuasif bahwa kami akan mengantarkan rektor usman sebagai rektor uisu yang legal
2168627 ini bisa kami buktikan saat kami masih di luar kampus saja api sudah berkobar di dalam kampus dan saat kami masuk gedung gedung sudah banyak yang rusak
2168628 jadi saat pengusiran waktu itu tidak ada mahasiswa mereka murni preman yang disewa
2168629 kami menjamin proses perkuliahan akan normal pekan depan dan kami juga yakin bisa menjaga keamanan dan ketertiban di sekitar kampus
2168630 apalagi gus irawan juga tidak asing lagi di dunia olahraga di sumut berarti sudah ketemu jodohnya
2168631 yang paling mengesankan sosok gus irawan tidak pernah menjadikan jabatan sebagai alat pajangan tapi selalu menjadikan jabatan sebagai sebuah alat pembuktian amanah dan perjuangan
2168632 karena kita sudah tahu kepemimpinan dan keberhasilan figur seorang gus irawan ia punya motivasi tinggi terhadap kemajuan olahraga contoh konkrit dapat kita lihat dari kepemimpinannya dalam satu perusahaan perbankan yang mampu menyehatkan bank sumut dari keterpurukan dari pengalaman manajemen itu gus irawan bisa pimpin koni sumut dan bangkitkan pasi sumut dalam pemilihan nanti kita berharap keberhasilan dan kredibilitas gus irawan selama ini bisa jadi suatu pertimbangan
2168633 ini keberhasilan spektakuler bahkan selama menjabat ketua pengprop pasi sumut gus juga mampu mengirim atlet sumut ke pelatnas prestasi ini perlu diperhatikan dan dihargai
2168634 mana yang banyak berperan membantu dan memperhatikan atlit selama ini sudah tentu kita dukung
2168635 figur gus irawan pas untuk memimpin koni sumut apalagi sosok gus irawan bisa bersinerji dengan semua pihak baik eksekutif legislatif dan pengusaha tidak hanya peduli dan perhatian terhadap kesejahteraan gus juga peduli pendidikan atlit kita semua menggantungkan harapan pada sosok gus irawan untuk membangkitkan kembali dunia olahraga sumut lebih berprestasi dan berpristise
2168636 perdagangan manusia trafficking sudah berkembang menjadi kejahatan transnasional dari sisi hak azasi manusia perdagangan manusia merupakan pelanggaran berat ham karena itu harus dicegah diberantas dan pelakunya dituntut dan diadili dengan hukuman yang barat
2168637 atau bentuk lain dengan menyalahgunakan kekuasan terhadap kedudukan yang rentan atau dengan perjanjian utang sampai pada pelacuran dan sebagainya
2168638 dengan dikeluarkannya beberapa peraturan perundang undangan diharapkan peraturan pelaksana di daerah dalam bentuk perda tidak bertentangan dengan perundang undangan yang lain
2168639 dua tahun terakhir pbb memasukkan indonesia dalam daftar hitam sebagai negara yang tidak melakukan tindakan untuk menghapus trafficking
2168640 untuk itu semua pihak harus terlibat mencegah dan memberantas trafficking mengingat besaran dan kompleksnya tindak pidana trafficking
2168641 sumut memiliki sederatan lembaga masyarakat yang konsen berjuang memerangi tindak kejahatan kemanusiaan ini
2168642 ketimpangan ekonomi makin parah pengangguran kini tercatat 10 2 juta jiwa kemiskinan 35 juta jiwa dan kerusakan lingkungan makin menjadi jadi
2168643 padahal kedua tampuk tersebut terkait erat dengan hajat hidup orang banyak prospektif dan telah dikelola dengan menyedot anggaran negara
2168644 di tengah pengurasan besar besaran sumber daya alam yang sebagian besar merusak lingkungan rakyat kecil di daerah tetap saja miskin dan makin tercerabut dari sumber penghidupan mereka yaitu hutan sungai ikan dan kebun
2168645 bahkan peranannya berangsur angsur kian terpinggirkan seiring arus globalisasi ekonomi yang telah merombak mode produksi menjadi kapitalistik liberal
2168646 konsep ini akan kami serahkan kepada pemerintah dengan harapan konsep ini dapat dipakai dalam membangun ekonomi indonesia
2168647 kami baca di koran poldasu telah menjadikan status kedua tersangka sebagai tahanan kota menyusul adanya upaya perdamaian dengan keluarga tapi dengan manajemen pt hdti sebagai pengadu sama sekali belum ada perdamaian dengan kedua tersangka karena itu manajemen meminta agar proses hukum kasus pencurian uang perusahaan itu jalan terus
2168648 yang dirugikan dalam kasus pencurian uang itu adalah perusahaan karenanya manajemen mengadukan kasus tersebut ke poldasu kami sebagai pemimpin di pt hdti group bertanggung jawab terhadap uang dan aset perusahaan manajemen tak mungkin mengganti uang perusahaan yang dicuri itu
2168649 yang menyatakan damai itu siapa perdamaian antarkeluarga pemilik saham tidak ada kaitan dengan kasus pencurian uang milik perusahaan karena itu manajemen mengharapkan damai iya dan kasus pencurian jalan terus
2168650 manajemen bekerja secara profesional karena itu siapapun tak bisa seenaknya mengambil uang milik perusahaan
2168651 saat ini kedua belah pihak yang bertikai berupaya menyelesaikan masalah secara kekeluargaan

2168654 my friends we will disagree on a specific issue and thats healthy
2168655 i believe in renewable fuels i dont believe in ethanol subsidies but i believe in renewable fuels
2168656 my mission and my job as president of the united states will be to make sure every market in the world is open to your products
2168657 agriculture products here in the state of iowa can feed the world and were not afraid to compete with anybody
2168658 this is the heartland of america this is what america is all about this is the people i want to know and meet
2168659 he voted against ethanol subsidies hes opposed to the farm bill
2168660 what it proves is he doesnt care about whats important to iowa
2168661 america is hurting right now weve got a lot of work to do
2168662 part of the old tired politics of a party in washington that has run out of ideas and run out of steam
2168663 its not that youre not ready barak obama is not ready yet because when it comes to the economy experience matters and he just doesnt have it he says hell give you change but thats what hell leave you with
2168664 okay ill ask you a little less nicely now are you bat fuck insane
2168665 really now whats so insane about letting the dams burst
2168666 you actually embarass yourself more when you scratch your behind in public or let one rip
2168667 ill say your er gaseous signatures smell upto high heaven
2168668 yeah and other peoples farts smell like daisies dont they besides etiquette dictates that the people around the emitter ignore the persons sudden lapse and continue with what they were doing and the culprit does his best to cover it up crying however is totally different
2168669 well firstly because people are forced to ask why the person is crying
2168670 well first of all you just gave a bad test
2168671 you see when you give a bad test you are intimidating scary you jump down the throat of the first person you see
2168672 youre being pretty unhappy about it but youre not exactly the devil incarnate
2168673 would you mind people around me are starting to think im crazy
2168674 darling everyone talks to themselves youre not the first one you know
2168675 yep look at the girl over there go on get up and look at the girl sitting on the corner computer
2168676 then i win by default now continuing on the reasons to cry you miss her
2168677 get the process over with will you youre giving me a headache here
2168678 just cry and get it over with that way well both be happy and gay
2168679 by gay i mean the happy gay not the gay gay
2168680 besides like i said i cant and wont cry especially in public
2168681 oh dont be daft look over there thats a wet cry baby if i ever saw one
2168682 well theres a law those not endowed with dicks are permitted to behave as eccentrically as possible
2168683 ahun so how else am i supposed to make the language more colourful
2168684 you know people are right it is fun to annoy you
2168685 oh come on now oblige me a little cry like the good boy you are
2168686 i will not be pushed around by anyone especially you
2168687 oh come on dont tell me you dont miss her cry for her sake at least
2168688 think do you remember the way she looks up at you
2168689 or the way she opens up her hair just because you think she looks better that way even though it makes her most uncomfortable
2168690 or the way she smiles and laughs sometimes at your lamest most hopeless jokes
2168691 the way she lets you pester her before saying she loves you
2168692 it was her fault i am waiting for her to make the first move
2168693 i see but why are you lurking in the shadows like the guilty one
2168694 yes she said things but so did you isnt it
2168695 and i told you to keep her close didnt i
2168696 i dont know the least she can do is give me a sign
2168697 would you not care for her if she said she didnt for you
2168698 ive apologised too many times she knows not to trust my word
2168699 what do you want that i apologise to her will that make things better
2168700 no but are you going to let her go without some fight
2168701 ok what if she comes to you first what do you expect
2168702 well do you expect her to come running to you to take you in her arms for comfort
2168703 and pray what comfort can she expect from someone who was too afraid to own up
2168704 either way youre not going to win either neither will
2168705 agreed but didnt you swear to accompany her till this other one comes
2168706 it does not look as though he was struck by a vehicle

2168708 the prominent role of it in creating business value has accelerated the establishment of the concept of it governance as a high priority for boards of directors and executive management it governance practices need to focus on ensuring that the expectations of it are met an effective it governance program will help organizations understand the issues and ensure that it can sustain operations and help enable companies to use it for competitive advantage

2168712 some long standing issues of resources are about to be resolved
2168713 i am for the first time in a long time optimistic that this project is going to be completed
2168714 a development like this is in line with a new form of urban revitalization for more mature urban communities like castle shannon
2168715 i think we probably should just drop it at this point
2168716 i think we would spend countless dollars pursuing it and might not get a solution
2168717 it sounds like that definition would include snakes and people do have snakes as pets
2168718 but if we pass this with this language in there well have every snake owner in the township down here complaining
2168719 i think we ought to get it right before we approve it so we dont end up going back and amending it later

2168721 he was just a kid who wanted to put on a show
2168722 its written in the vein of the late comedies of neil simon and noel coward
2168723 so many comic writers work for television or film rather than the stage
2168724 its more lucrative so we need good comedies like this one
2168725 its coming to me late in life and after all this time from pennsylvania where i grew up
2168726 the one thing members complained about most was the number of cigarette butts in some areas like at the park n ride on duss avenue
2168727 youre going to see more consumer like marketing come from us than youve traditionally seen in the past
2168728 youre going to hear us talking about our products in a different way than we traditionally have and its not going to be were sending a data sheet
2168729 when we look at our architecture as it stands today with four cores it starts to really shine
2168730 the actual benefit of having our architecture versus our competitors architecture starts to really become apparent
2168731 when you look at the r amp d budgets of the three players in the industry intel nvidia and amd its unrealistic for anyone to believe that any of the companies are going to be in a leadership position from an absolute performance perspective for a very long period of time
2168732 i think that the game has changed when amd came out with amd64 architecture and launched opteron until then intel had this almost undisputed monopolistic position it was challenged in 2000 by athlon then they came back with pentium and then when we came with amd64 and the opteron processor people thought well this is just a repeat of the same game and im telling you the game has changed a lot it changed a lot because we merged with ati and so we now have a complete platform
2168733 when we were amd traditionally weve been a processor company with the acquisition of ati now were a platform company were an experience company and thats something that were wanting to get across with our processors its not just about doing subtraction multiplication and division quickly its about doing more with your pc its about the experience with your pc and how a quad core or a phenom dual core will help you with that experience
2168734 amd when you look at our future the fusion and torrenza initiatives that were doing its about heterogeneous cores its about having the right technology for the market its not about just throwing more cores into the mix because that doesnt do everything for everyone you can throw more cylinders in a car it doesnt necessarily make it better
2168735 so whether were at 90 nm or 45 nm or 32 nm it doesnt make a difference to the consumer theyre not buying nanometers theyre buying the performance and the experience of their whole platform
2168736 so what do nanometers do lets be frank what do nanometers give you
2168737 it gives you a more efficient manufacturing process which reduces power increases yields and reduces costs as you move through the manufacturing steps its going to be cheaper for you to make those wafers and you pass that on to your consumers and your oems so its good to get to 65 and 45 and what not but now unnaturally you do things to get there thats really what makes sense right our customers are not banging down our door saying you need to get to 32 nm tomorrow because theres no benefit
2168738 why dont you take that and look at current cpus that are available in the market in the server space where it really really matters and look at performance per watt leadership
2168739 and we have performance per watt leadership that tells me that either our competitors have an incredibly inefficient
2168740 there comes a point in time when theres diminishing returns
2168741 i dont think were there yet and everyones still keeping pace with moores law but i dont think youre going to see a big benefit to intel to move to 45 nm
2168742 we are focused on delivering the products to our customers that our customers are asking for and were committed to giving our customers the innovative products that weve traditionally always delivered
2168743 i think what youre going to see is really a change of the game where leadership position in the absolute benchmark that a lot of the enthusiasts are looking at may change as quickly as every six months
2168744 and thats good frankly thats good for the industry thats good for the end user competition is a great thing sure if we can have leadership for a long period of time thats something thats a position you enjoy but i really think that the dynamic of the market has changed and without wanting to take too much credit for it i still think we can thank amd for having changed that dynamic and i think the end user will benefit from that

2168824 when it hurts to look back and youre scared to look ahead you can look beside you and your best friend will be there
2168825 let me share some views from the academic vantage point
2168826 he hated george w bush and that he wanted to put a bullet in the presidents head
2168827 if he wanted to kill senator obama he simply would shoot him with a sniper rifle but then he claimed that he was just joking
2168828 the vice president looks forward to participating in the republican national convention and continuing to work for the election of sen mccain and other republican candidates in the coming months
2168829 there is still a very strong contingent of hillary delegates in the texas delegation
2168830 there are still delegates that want her to be nominated and want to vote for her
2168831 i know that there have been a lot of questions on this subject senator barack obama and i share the goal of ensuring that the voices of everyone who participated in this historic process are respected
2168832 quite frankly both candidates made it a historic year and created a change in the dynamic of campaigns that i think people will never forget
2168833 you could argue that nobody is ever ready to be president
2168834 this may be the sadder observation that it may not even be relevant
2168835 we thought it was an issue that there were people giving to the campaign who had no intention of supporting or voting for john mccain
2168836 so we thought it was an appropriate measure at this point
2168837 reminding them of the campaign finance law and providing some information as to how to get a refund if thats what they desire
2168838 if it is not illegal for a foreign national to bundle checks it ought to be since its illegal for a foreign national to make contributions in the first place
2168839 people always make allegations in lawsuits its purely a commercial dispute
2168840 the glory of god enlightens it and the lamb is the light thereof
2168841 government is too big he wants to grow it taxes are to high he wants to raise them
2168842 congress spends too much and he proposes more we need more energy and hes against producing it were finally winning in iraq and he wants to forfeit
2168843 at the time of the merger no one anticipated an impact on jobs in wilmington
2168844 john mccain through this whole thing has said zero about his connection to dhl
2168845 whether its a vote changing issue or not i think it might be a little too early to tell its a matter of making sure our situation here stays on the front burner
2168846 one of the worst job catastrophes that any community in this nation is facing
2168847 we are going to need some involvement by the german government
2168848 a f hrer order is not the 11 th commandment
2168849 tiny bit of the stuff i look at on the net
2168850 there were so many people lying on the ground covering the street even among those who were barely walking some had burned clothes on most were naked there were also those whose eyes had been blown out of their sockets by the bomb blast
2168851 the rivers running through the city were also filled with corpses many of them were those who had jumped into the river to escape from the fire or to cool down their burns only to drown
2168852 what were trying to do is make a strong statement that we remember the devastation and what we want is a world of peace
2168853 the idea is to show graphically and make people think about the black rain that fell in hiroshima and nagasaki after the bombings
2168854 we want to draw attention to peace and the abolition of not exclusively nuclear warfare but to war in general
2168855 all this just dont seem real my sons an honor roll student i give him everything i spoil him i dont see why he would need to rob anybody
2168856 from gold chains to earrings i give him everything he wants i wont have to worry about him selling drugs
2168857 he didnt seem out of the ordinary he wasnt shaky he keeps himself clean and the clothes he had on were spotless he had on a white t shirt and white sneakers
2168858 there was no evidence in general no evidence of excessive force being used
2168859 i cant get down to the specifics of what we did or did not find in the autopsy
2168860 its more of like a passive investigation where well gather police reports and newspaper accounts we will be monitoring the county investigation
2168861 in a progressive society the people cannot allow overzealous poorly trained police officers to commit murder against innocent citizens
2168862 we demand that the officers involved in the death of andre thomas be relieved of duty until a complete investigation has been conducted
2168863 no comment regarding this case will come from this council due to the fact that the incident you are referring to is under investigation by the county police and district attorneys office

2168876 welcome to the official web page of ballet folkl rico de uc merced
2168877 the paper was turned up to the story about brandon
2168878 and after all my wife went through i got very touched
2168879 we should try to get something good out of this
2168880 was at the gym all the time she was vivacious looked 10 years younger than her age
2168881 it was a roller coaster ride but it only went one way down
2168882 so when we heard about brandon it just made sense for us to go ahead with it but for him
2168883 the home care nurses used to tell my mom she should go into nursing that she would be very good at it
2168884 we went to the same school but we had different classes
2168885 it was amazing that someone her age could go back to school
2168886 people would come and go some died but its still in existence today
2168887 the administration in both districts bears a lot of responsibility for getting a lot of this done
2168888 our jobs include doing a lot of the groundwork on a lot of these questions
2168889 its not about money its about the principle of the thing that other council members didnt listen to vera and me they brought this on themselves
2168890 why would i give away carnegie money for services not rendered
2168891 we dont spend time discussing the issues of the town
2168892 right now the way i see it mr freshwater has to prove i dont belong in there
2168893 chow wagon donations drop animal friends seeks dog and cat food money july 31
2168894 every day we have to find every bird in this room to make sure they are healthy the best way to do that is to call each one
2168895 we are going to honk like flamingos to try to make them dance
2168896 every experience these birds have with the public makes their life a little more interesting
2168897 i never have a bad day with the animals every day i feel fortunate
2168898 the first thing they say when they visit is can we go downstairs
2168899 eventually you find something you dont have yet and you figure youd like to add it to your collection
2168900 it fits my fancy if its beat up really old and rusted i need to have that
2168901 this was really bad once and he took it all apart and painted the back it was hard for him to do
2168902 when we were dating i used to stop by the candy store and they had gum ball machines with little trinkets and i would bring them to her and she saved them all
2168903 i enjoy it you want to come in every day
2168904 they want to sit and tell you stories you listen and talk to them
2168905 she was not happy with me after i nominated her
2168906 she plays with them shes affectionate and they listen to her she will do anything you ask her to do
2168907 the kids i think need a little bit extra i push them grandmas way
2168908 youngsters who are involved with the placement centers to get some one on one attention
2168909 it benefits the volunteers by allowing them to remain active it improves their self esteem and self worth
2168910 i kind of see what were doing as a grass roots movement to leverage the school board to try to get a fair curriculum
2168911 you just want to promote what you believe in and are passionate about
2168912 you want it to be better you want it to be fair
2168913 kids are not learning how to think outside the box and thats what art does if you have a good arts program in school it helps develop kids creative thinking process
2168914 its good for the citizens the municipality and the police department
2168915 we discussed with him very clearly that at north hills if one of our staff members were to partake in any of the offerings at canyon it would not be recognized at north hills
2168916 we dont see the affiliation being necessarily relevant here at north hills
2168917 maybe there was some misinformation brought to us by them
2168918 if someone is taking course work to get a degree they need to do their homework to ensure it is an accredited legitimate degree granting institution otherwise they may end up spending money and doing work for what ultimately could be a meaningless degree
2168919 i dont know anything about canyon college and quite honestly i dont really care what im looking for is somebody who can shoot the lights out for the north hills school district
2168920 we hired a guy to do a job as an administrator based on the feedback that weve received from the people who know him best in his previous district weve received rave reviews
2168921 based upon what i know now i would need to reconnect and re evaluate the situation with canyon college
2168922 i have a commitment to the staff at west middlesex
2168923 we just were trying to do something that was good for the district
2168924 i had all the right intentions in mind and that is to help educators become better educators
2168925 theres no legal basis for the claim this is a legitimate degree
2168926 the entity itself has no legal authority to issue degrees it would be like saying i did a bunch of course work for wal mart and they gave me a degree
2168927 said mark browning spokesman for the idaho state board of education
2168928 the taxpayers deserve a little bit more for their money
2168929 we try to make it a learning experience for all the kids
2168930 its a good way for them to learn its tangible very hands on
2168931 best buddies is a great program its really rewarding and really fun
2168932 everyone gets something out of it they learn from you and you learn from them
2168933 everyone should give it a chance and get involved its not a commitment to a club its a commitment to a friend
2168934 we dont know how cell phones will affect us down the line they are a relatively new phenomenon ive lost the battles on phone safety some of my family actually drives while talking to say nothing of the cost of a plan for three teenagers and a husband who travels
2168935 with this report i got their attention now at least for a while
2168936 this just confirms for me the concerns i already had about brain cancer said robert matzen of bethel park
2168937 now i am really careful to keep my conversations short said mr matzen 46 an independent filmmaker for paladin communications of bethel park
2168938 definitely interested in buying a hands free device for our car
2168939 shorten conversations and we are more aware of where the phone is placed
2168940 i just learned of a device that claims to negate the effects its a little disc that you put in your cell phone to eliminate the electromagnetic fields so my plan is to purchase it said mrs yehnert 55 a homemaker
2168941 refuses to let my kids get a cell phone until they are at least 16
2168942 now i carry my cell phone with the battery away from me said ms mckown 51 manager at curves in brentwood town square
2168943 i work in academic affairs at pitt and im paying attention to the report now i plan to get bluetooth and told my kids to text not call said carol tatrai 49 of west homestead
2168944 i dont like bluetooth it scares me people talking to themselves i do text message does that mean ill get finger cancer asked the 25 year old waitress at mitchells fish market at the waterfront
2168945 theres not enough data science always flip flops on what is good for you or bad for you one day eggs are good and the next day theyre bad wine is bad and then wine is good said mr folino 29 who owns folino brothers pizzeria in scott
2168946 these days someone finds something wrong with anything new ive not seen any definitive medical evidence so i wont limit use
2168947 in my business i travel and need to be in touch all the time said douglas wesolek 28 of dormont who owns west liberty detailing in that town

2168952 i love watching other people dance it brings back memories of my carrick high school days
2168953 as a single parent i have to watch my finances i buy an annual pass and all this is included
2168954 we must have had something in common because we became best buddies
2168955 it was a 4 4 1 2 hour drive home and for the first time dad was willing to open up and talk about the experience
2168956 maybe it was as if he thought until now if he didnt talk about hurtful things it wouldnt hurt
2168957 there i was in a nursing home when i got the call
2168958 people were stopping to ask about it at the airport
2168959 the losses were about equal the people we lost to weather and the people we lost to combat
2168960 the first thing i asked the guy was are my legs still there
2168961 people were coming up to my dad spontaneously asked to shake his hand and to thank him
2168962 we asked ourselves how do we get calf to speak when we have a deaf mother
2168963 its ok to sneak into movies pirate music and share drinks because its money they wouldnt see anyway
2168964 i dont have much money and im tired of wasting it on their hastily produced albums with one good song
2168965 well if i was still a yout i know how i would break up dis rass
2168966 any business thats willing to pay someone 7 75 can afford to pay them 8 then re iterate their conclusion that minimum wage should be raised

2169003 i suspect he will garner a fraction of 1 percent of the vote and be irrelevant to the outcome
2169004 i would say a lot of the issues from 2004 are still on the table they are still ignored by the two parties and the two major candidates and are getting worse
2169005 the word spoiler is a contemptuous word of political bigotry as if small candidates are second class citizens
2169006 people who have fought the civil rights battle politically economically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about look what would happen if we had an african american president or chairpersons of major congressional committees
2169007 it doesnt look like its going to be what we all thought it would be
2169008 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
2169009 in his best year he was the outsider candidate in a race with two political brand names gore and bush
2169010 you throw him a life jacket and he rejects your help
2169011 shes the pokemon and youre the trainer just throw a ball and catch
2169012 i think you look like the sort whom wont get married till 30
2169013 i can see that youre a very independent person able to stand strong without the help of others
2169014 were suggesting its in everyones best interest to get pat back to work expeditiously the city is paying him and he ought to be working
2169015 the idea here is to get a decent public servant back to serving the public
2169016 weve waited this long to pass judgment and until i hear back officially from the commission well reserve judgment
2169017 but i will say its in everybodys best interest to try to bring this issue to closure and if mr fishers statements yesterday were accurate the ethics board will communicate that to us in the very near future and then the ura board will make a decision obviously with input from myself as well
2169018 has received assurances from authorities that his cooperation with them is of mutual interest
2169019 pittsburghs a distressed city and were giving away our prime riverfront property
2169020 i heard a crack and i thought it was a car backfire
2169021 i was scared the minute a co worker said there was a gunman out there
2169022 as soon as i heard the robbery report i was guessing it was related
2169023 we have a group of bank robbers out there and theyre shooting and we have to get them off the streets
2169024 this is ligonier pennsylvania a great place to live and raise a family
2169025 there were so many people involved with this somebody out there must know something
2169026 we heard loud and clear at public hearings that people didnt want to see local or long distance diversions to local roads
2169027 we believe this plan favorably addresses some of the concerns
2169028 this continues to be a classical case of robbing peter to pay paul ripping the carpet out from underneath rural pennsylvania to better serve more affluent communities
2169029 this is not something that this group is prepared to offer at this point
2169030 we want to take a thoughtful approach without feeling that were pressed to act with some sense of urgency
2169031 we feel like a lot of this we received in the 11th hour and were asked to put forth enabling legislation we owe it to our constituents to make sure that whether its the municipal government or city residents theyre actually informed
2169032 do we need two economic development agencies do we need all of these different planning authorities
2169033 i think that clearly around the table here there are a wide range of views beyond that one expressed and recommended in the nordenberg report
2169034 believes a full consolidation of city and county government is the best choice for residents
2169035 we believe the state is very committed to the direction we are taking
2169036 how do we ever get the state to realize that
2169037 meskipun kamu suka memotret objek baik itu benda makhluk hidup orang ataupun pemandangan jangan lupa untuk memotret diri sendiri
2169038 no knowledge can be true if it has not attached itself to the task of transforming reality but the transformative process requires an involvement in the process of transforming human relationships
2169039 how can the standstill system and we make a meaningful conversation together
2169040 but i cant think of another group that deserves this more
2169041 i think its something were going to need to build on
2169042 its a shame when you lose a company like that because they really are the hub of the entire community
2169043 thats a legitimate concern you have people who are members in name only
2169044 but i think thats a problem the chiefs can sort out if you have someone who isnt pulling their weight the chief can say they dont qualify for the tax credit
2169045 thats very helpful in this current climate to have people agree on both sides
2169046 we all see the benefit these companies provide the story sells itself
2169047 everybody in the state is losing volunteers its across the board
2169048 if we dont do something to bolster those ranks its going to come out of everyones pocket because municipalities are going to have to look at hiring
2169049 it is an election year and congress probably isnt going to be doing a whole lot
2169050 but theres no reason why it couldnt pass in the near future
2169051 to organize the worlds information and make it universally accessible and useful
2169052 work should be challenging and the challenge should be fun

2169056 electronic products are capable of amazing things largely because of the more powerful chips at their heart
2169057 we want to help electronics makers keep the innovations coming our chip cooling technology is just one tool at our disposal to help them do that
2169058 cooling is a holistic challenge from the individual transistor to the datacenter powerful techniques brought as close as possible to the chip right where the cooling is needed will be crucial for tackling the power and cooling issues
2169059 come on back aug 15 and see the show well have funnel cake and hitlers brain
2169060 there are a lot of things i enjoy that dont exist anymore
2169061 i find myself drawn to things that no longer exist that are worth saving
2169062 i kind of have this view of the 1950s as the epitome of consumerism and commercialism
2169063 the economy was prosperous everybody was happy there were bad things that happened but they were swept under the rug everybody was happy whether they liked it or not
2169064 in one one hundredth of a second my brain worked and said youre interested in the sideshow thing lie

2169070 the interviews are diametrically different in regard to the use of the taser as opposed to stepping on his neck and punching him
2169071 what dr williams has been able to tell me is there is no trauma to the neck or the head which is consistent with the type of beating a very violent beating a repeated use of the foot feet or punching around the head or neck
2169072 were anxious to get as much information as we can from as many people as we can
2169073 help me they are trying to kill me they are trying to shoot me
2169074 she orders him down on the ground he initially goes down she unholsters her taser he after some amount of time starts to get up
2169075 we intend to consult with the fbi about this too hes not a criminal based upon his conduct that evening people thought he was dangerous but as far as im concerned i would not charge him with a crime
2169076 more dramatic so initially it could be one punch the second time its repeatedly punch the third time more than one officer did in fact punch this guy
2169077 ive already seen that this was going to get nasty theyre trying to squash my credibility
2169078 a couple of times they would just sort of reach down and touch him gently

2169086 the premise of this prosecution is that words have power
2169087 the images conjured by ms fletchers words are as horrifying or more horrifying than any photographs or videos of child pornography which can be seen on the internet
2169088 the individuals willing to pay money to subscribe to this web site clearly have a very strong sexual interest in children not just a sexual interest but a violent sexual interest
2169089 in my stories i have created new monsters they rise above the horror of the real life monsters
2169090 somehow making these monsters so much worse makes me feel better and makes my life seem more bearable
2169091 i may still be afraid of the monsters but at least in the stories they prey on someone else not me
2169092 i recognized that i didnt have to be afraid of rejection because i was hiding behind the anonymity of the internet
2169093 instead of being rejected the response was supportive and some individuals even said that my stories helped them i felt safer here than at any other time in my life
2169094 if anyone would have read the story and acted upon it a little child could have suffered devastation that you would have had to live with for the rest of your life

2169098 pemerintah samosir sudah menetapkan samosir sebagai kabupaten pariwisata namun sampai saat ini tanda tanda untuk ke sana tidak tampak
2169099 secara geografis samosir dan indonesia sangat cantik pemandangannya namun memang perlu kerja keras untuk menghidupkannya kembali
2169100 kita harus mendorong pemerintah untuk terus meningkatkan dan memperbaiki infrastruktur ini
2169101 padahal kalau dijaga hutan kita dunia mau membayar 5 dolar perhektar pertahun
2169102 tidak saatnya lagi kita terus mengeluh mari kita bangkitkan pariwisata samosir melalui program samosir bangkit
2169103 kalau pariwisata bagus maka para petani juga akan senang karena produksinya akan langsung diserap
2169104 kita berharap gerakan ini nantinya akan mendorong wisatawan lokal berkunjung ke pulau samosir

2169109 terpaksa kami kemari hotel hotel penuh syukur saja ada tamu keluar kami bisa mendapatkan dua kamar hitung hitung ya untuk posko dululah sebelum mendapatkan kamar hotel yang baik
2169110 memang biasanya saat hari besar agama seperti lebaran ini pengunjung lebih suka memilih wisma karena lebih asyik bisa memasak sendiri seolah di rumah mereka apalagi datang dengan rombongan keluarga tapi kalangan ekonomi tinggi yang tidak mau repot repot ya tetap memilih hotel dengan fasilitas penuh akan tetapi jika tidak booking jangankan hotel wisma seperti kami ini pun susah mendapatkan kamarnya

2169114 kita sangat menyambut baik keputusan dpr ri yang menolak pembentukan protap dan keputusan itu merupakan keputusan yang sangat bijak yang diambil oleh wakil rakyat di pusat sebab kalau protap digolkan tentu diperdiksi akan terjadi perpecahan yang sangat luas di provinsi sumatera utara ini
2169115 kita patut acungkan jempol kepada dpr ri yang sangat bijak dalam mengambil keputusan dan aspiratif
2169116 kita menilai orang orang yang menggelindingkan wacana pembentukan protap hanya memikirkan jabatan padahal pemerintah pusat sudah memberikan kesempatan yang seluas luasnya kepada daerah untuk memajukan daerahnya dengan keluarnya otonomi daerah buat apalagi melakukan pemekaran provinsi dan kita bisa lihat sendiri provinsi mana yang setelah dimekarkan bisa maju bahkan hanya mengharapkan dau dana alokasi umum saja yang akhirnya akan membuka peluang korupsi baru
2169117 people still werent getting more money in their pockets at the same time costs were going up so it was harder to save harder to retire which meant people were maxing out on their credit cards they were taking out home equity loans to pay off bills
2169118 we need to crack down on those who have abused our credit market and caused this housing decline
2169119 and we need to take action to support american businesses so that we stop jobs from going overseas and create more jobs here at home
2169120 contracted partly because the federal government did not oversee the lending process as effectively as it should have
2169121 they think that theyre better off today than they were four or eight years ago do they think that the economy is working right now
2169122 if they do then they should work their heart out for john mccain because his policies are not different from what george bush has been offering
2169123 the proceeds are for a good cause theres no question about that

2169134 are you truly supporting sen obama and encouraging your supporters to do the same or are you just saying what you have to
2169135 would at least give your supporters a voice in the choice for the partys nominee
2169136 were not talking to those people were talking directly to the clinton campaign people and staff
2169137 and i am going to respect the privacy of that process by not discussing it
2169138 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
2169139 without question we know as a matter of fact that mr cornyn was an obstructionist on the last debate on comprehensive immigration reform
2169140 he hasnt done anything in six years to help reform immigration

2169147 possible transaction that had potential to add value for stockholders
2169148 we have concluded that we will not pursue the transaction
2169149 we will now recommend purchasing shares in open market transactions but we will continue to evaluate the efficiencies of all methods for returning cash to stockholders
2169150 the new accounting doesnt really make sense for an insurer because our obligations are buy and hold and weve been saying that since 2001
2169151 it does however make sense to use mark to market valuations for trading a debt or stock portfolio

2169192 i know who have instigated the police to arrest my husband
2169193 he is one of the best military commanders the jumma struggle has ever produced and as a commander he was popular with both the shanti bahini members and the people at large
2169194 therefore it is not surprising that many jummas would view his arrest as an attempt to vilify a great struggle that they had been very much part of

2169198 when i went in a month ago a second station had fallen and was in pieces each of these sections of plaster is going to continue to fall like dominoes the inside of the church is just literally crumbling
2169199 when i went inside of there there wasnt even a musty smell some plaster had fallen because of a clogged gutter but that was about it you could have held mass in there if you wanted
2169200 its been 21 years i think it would have collapsed by now if it were going to collapse
2169201 the only thing that council ever discussed about st michael is the wall facing fifth street needs to be fixed because it was falling down that doesnt have anything to do with the church itself
2169202 its a fun game but it gets a bad rap
2169203 theres an awful lot of just good folks playing this game
2169204 its really exciting for the kids to get to express themselves
2169205 we could see that he was a big strong boy and we thought that he would make a good billy goat
2169206 it enhances their social skills just teaching them to be comfortable with themselves it makes them confident in themselves
2169207 it also makes them feel like people care and it introduces them to the world outside of the shelter
2169208 it gives them a chance to be able to laugh again and to feel childlike again and to be free of stress for a while
2169209 a lot of them just loved being able to be on a stage and perform
2169210 and for some of them who had never been on a stage before an audience they were inspired that they had done something more than they had ever done in the past
2169211 it came to me who better to write it than the person who lived it mr eiben said
2169212 its amazing how your life can be affected by just one event

2169217 jefferson regional is a 373 bed hospital with mostly private rooms we are the largest of only three remaining independent community hospitals in allegheny county
2169218 as the new investors in this health facility we are excited about providing the residents of bethel park and the surrounding area with choice when it comes to their health care services
2169219 we recognize that the people who live in the area have relationships with the physicians and health care providers in the building
2169220 you havent lived until youve kissed a horse on the lips
2169221 they never really bothered me there were a couple smart alecks
2169222 it was scary it made me feel real nervous but at the same time very excited the owner put me on my first horse which was a plug
2169223 i was noted as a front rider because i had a clock in my head and i could get out of the gate and sit there and relax
2169224 i won the first race i ever ran there if you bet 2 on me you made 95 and i was a star
2169225 fulfillment becoming one with the horse and the exuberance of riding on the back of a horse that accomplishes something that you are striving for
2169226 i flew off i just got back on i lost control of my arms and i figured something was wrong and so that was it
2169227 ive seen some terrible things there are people who take good care of their horses but i would say for most people its just a commodity its a money maker
2169228 its really a sad exploitation and i went into this business for the love of the horse
2169229 i was holding my breath as soon as i got on it was fun like riding a bike
2169230 just that bond again that smell again i love that smell

2169234 these kids are able to ride a two wheel bike they just dont know it yet
2169235 its a rite of passage for young people to be able to do this
2169236 by being able to ride a regular two wheel bicycle that looks just like their neighbors bike it helps them become more integrated and involved in the community with their peers
2169237 its a really interesting process because its so intuitive instead of teaching the student discovers the balance
2169238 when they make that transition to two wheels their world explodes
2169239 they have opportunities to work with and be part of a peer group they have for so long been excluded from it gives the family an opportunity to do something together
2169240 because it kind of reminds me of races like speed racer
2169241 it was emotional it was nice to see him having so much fun doing really well and having some optimism that hes going to get this and have success
2169242 its something that he can carry on for the rest of his life not only is it exercise its transportation its the social element hes able to ride with the typical peers in his neighborhood

2169251 the night is almost gone and the day is near therefore let us lay aside the deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light
2169252 for the wisdom of this world is foolishness in gods sight

2169254 a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts
2169255 i think that today the whole christian world including the whole world of orthodoxy has become cut off from the simplicity the all inclusiveness and triumphant beauty of the gospels christ with his group of disciples founded a church which was so deep so all embracing so complete that it contained within itself the whole universe
2169256 if you are not a staretz then what are you are you a prophet
2169257 i have boldly asserted that whatever his peculiar character or circumstances might be if the prodigal would come home to his heavenly father he would find enough and to spare in the fathers house to supply all his need both for this world and the next and i have known thousands nay i can say tens of thousands who have literally proved this to be true having with little or no temporal assistance come out of the darkest depths of destitution vice and crime to be happy and honest citizens and true sons and servants of god it will be seen therefore that in this or in any other development that may follow i have no intention to depart in the smallest degree from the main principles on which i have acted in the past my only hope for the permanent deliverance of mankind from misery either in this world or the next is the regeneration or remaking of the individual by the power of the holy ghost through jesus christ but in providing for the relief of temporal misery i reckon that i am only making it easy where it is now difficult and possible where it is now all but impossible for men and women to find their way to the cross of our lord jesus christ

2169260 everyone must be personally prepared for meeting the bridegroom that the call will be sudden that the stock of oil is not common and that the time between his arrival and the shutting of the door will be awfully brief
2169261 flying with a golden eagle visions and impartations in the night season
2169262 prayer is first of all listening to god its openess god is always speaking always doing something prayer is to enter into that activity convert your thoughts into prayer as we are involved in unceasing thinking so we are called to unceasing prayer the difference is not that prayer is thinking about other things but that prayer is dialogue a conversation with god
2169263 lord how is it that some die when they are young while others drag on to extreme old age why are there those who are poor and those who are rich why do wicked men prosper and why are the just in need
2169264 anthony keep your attention on yourself these things are according to the judgment of god and it is not to your advantage to know anything about them
2169265 pay attention to what i tell you whoever you may be always have god before your eyes whatever you do do it according to the testimony of the holy scriptures in whatever place you live do not easily leave it keep these three precepts and you will be saved
2169266 this is the great work of a man always to take the blame for his own sins before god and to expect temptation to his last breath
2169267 whoever has not experienced temptation cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven
2169268 do not trust in your own righteousness do not worry about the past but control your tongue and your stomach
2169269 i saw the snares that the enemy spreads out over the world and i said groaning what can get through from such snares
2169270 some have afflicted their bodies by asceticism but they lack discernment and so they are far from god
2169271 our life and our death is with our neighbor if we gain our brother we have gained god but if we scandalize our brother we have sinned against christ
2169272 just as fish die if they stay too long out of water so the monks who loiter outside their cells or pass their time with men of the world lose the intensity of inner peace so like a fish going towards the sea we must hurry to reach our cell for fear that if we delay outside we will lose our interior watchfulness
2169273 he who wishes to live in solitude in the desert is delivered from three conflicts hearing speech and sight there is only one conflict for him and that is with fornication
2169274 how was it that the little donkey died on the way here
2169275 that was what we came to question you about for fear we were being deceived for we have visions which often turn out to be true
2169276 if i bend my bow so much i will break it
2169277 it is the same with the work of god if we stretch the brethren beyond measure they will soon break sometimes it is necessary to come down to meet their needs
2169278 this monk seems to me to be a ship loaded with goods but i do not know if he will reach harbor
2169279 a great pillar of the church has just fallen but go to him and see what has happened
2169280 tell the old man to pray that god will give me just ten days and i hope i will have made satisfaction
2169281 you are like a village magnificently decorated on the outside but destroyed from within by robbers
2169282 i will have no mercy on you nor will god have any if you yourself do not make an effort and if you do not pray to god
2169283 indeed abba joseph has found the way for he has said i do not know
2169284 you found this old man a good companion for the journey
2169285 no doubt they are good but they do not have a door to their house and anyone who wishes can enter the stable and loose the ass
2169286 you have read the scriptures that should teach you how
2169287 the gospel says if anyone strikes you on one cheek turn to him the other also
2169288 if you cannot offer the other cheek at least allow one cheek to be struck
2169289 if you are not able to do that do not return evil for evil
2169290 prepare a little brew of corn for these invalids if you cannot do this or that what can i do for you what you need is prayers
2169291 if you want to be a monk go into the village buy some meat cover your naked body with it and come here like that
2169292 those who renounce the world but want to keep something for themselves are torn in this way by the demons who make war on them
2169293 a boat was shipwrecked at sea and lost its cargo with great difficulty it reached the shore but you want to throw into the sea that which has found a safe harbor on the shore
2169294 i believe that the body possesses a natural movement to which it is adapted but which it cannot follow without the consent of the soul it only signifies in the body a movement without passion
2169295 do not get drunk with wine for that is debauchery
2169296 take heed to yourselves lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness
2169297 god does not allow the same warfare and temptations to this generation as he did formerly for men are weaker now and cannot bear so much
2169298 a time is coming when men will go mad and when they see someone who is not mad they will attack him saying
2169299 i have seen a man on the bank of the river buried up to his knees in mud and some men came to give him a hand to help him out but they pushed him further in up to his neck
2169300 if you go you will be called anthony but if you stay here you will be called abba anthony
2169301 i no longer fear god but i love him for love casts out fear
2169302 always have the fear of god before your eyes remember him who gives death and life hate the world and all that is in it hate all peace that comes from the flesh renounce this life so that you may be alive to god remember what you have promised god for it will be required of you on the day of judgment suffer hunger thirst nakedness be watchful and sorrowful weep groan in your heart test yourselves to see if you are worthy of god despise the flesh so that you may preserve your souls
2169303 by your prayers the number of the brethren increases and some of them want to build more cells where they may live in peace how far away from here do you think we should build the cells
2169304 let us eat at the ninth hour and then go out for a walk in the desert and explore the country
2169305 let us pray and plant the cross here so that those who wish to do so may build here then when those who remain here want to visit those who have come here they can take a little food at the ninth hour and then come if they do this they will be able to keep in touch with each other without distraction of mind
2169306 whoever hammers a lump of iron first decides what he is going to make of it a scythe a sword or an axe even so we ought to make up our minds what kind of virtue we want to forge or else we labor in vain
2169307 nine monks fell away after many labors and were obsessed with spiritual pride for they put their trust in their own works and being deceived they did not give due heed to the commandment that says ask your father and he will tell you
2169308 a time is coming when men will go mad and when they see someone who is not mad they will attack him saying
2169309 o divine madman you are crazed with love and drunk with love for me
2169310 the jesus that lives in you is not the one on the cross but the one who is resurrected and abundant life
2169311 eat what is good and let your soul delight in abundance
2169312 which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers
2169313 the silence and solitude of the desert for instance which so clearly revealed the hidden motivations of the heart focused the attention of the desert fathers upon moral ascetical psychological and spiritual questions in a particularly acute way the practical orientation of the desert fathers means that interpretation of scripture in the sayings almost never occurs for its own sake but is embedded in the life and concerns of the desert
2169314 the monks of a certain community were full of thought that by reason of their many fasts and long services they were surpassing other monks in virtue
2169315 do not tell me how much they fast how many hours their prayers last it is something else that interests me is there any among them even the most advanced who can understand the tired mankind of his own day who can comfort those who suffer is there anyone who can free those who have fallen into the snares of the enemy if there is such a one who can give peace to his brother man can enable him to come to love life to rejoice and be thankful to god that will show that this monk has made spiritual progress
2169316 at the heart of all that god is we discover utmost intentionality an ongoing purpose so profound that it touches our hearts and lives enabling us to become just as focused and purposeful as god himself the church the bride of christ is the central object of all gods focus intention and favor romance is at the heart of all that god has purposed for us we are learning how to live in relationship with god so that his intimacy within us matches the love that he has for us
2169317 god will punish all atheists they will burn in everlasting fire
2169318 tell me supposing you went to paradise and there looked down and saw somebody in hell fire would you feel happy
2169319 it cant be helped it would be their own fault
2169320 love could not bear that we must pray for all
2169321 day and night i pray to the lord for love and the lord gives me tears to weep for the whole world
2169322 what would i have of god what gifts i should answer the spirit of humility in which the lord rejoices above all things
2169323 tell me what i must do that they may leave me
2169324 he shall blossom as the lily and cast forth his roots as lebanon
2169325 bring me seventy of israels elders who are known to you as leaders and officials among the people have them come to the tent of meeting that they may stand there with you

2169327 you have stayed long enough at this mountain 7 break camp and advance into the hill country of the amorites go to all the neighbouring peoples in the arabah in the mountains in the western foothills in the negev and along the coast to the land of the canaanites and to lebanon as far as the great river the euphrates 8 see i have already given you this land go in and take possession of the land that the lord swore he would give to your fathers to abraham isaac and jacob and to their descendants after them
2169328 lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner
2169329 to call things that are not as if they were
2169330 if you return then i will bring you back you shall stand before me if you take out the precious from the vile
2169331 isaiah is saying god is going to be relentlessly on you until a passionate hoy zeal violently consumes you withy an unparalleled inner fire this speaks of an internal supernatural fire a spirit of burning that flows within you in an unhinderd fashion
2169332 fleeing the compromises of the fourth century church the desert fathers founded monasticism in reaction to a christianity they scarcely recognized these radicals fled to the egyptian desert to model a different radical style of discipleship filled with sacrifice and continual prayer who are the new monks the new punks the new revolutionaries the answer lies in an upsurge of small contemporary 24 7 monastic communities boiler rooms around the world punk monk follows the story of andy freemans remarkable journey of discovery which began with the initial explosion of 24 7 prayer rooms in 1999 it explains what boiler rooms are how they arose and what principles guide their development not least the ancient art of breathing in prayer and worship and breathing out acts and words of mercy and compassion
2169333 speaking powerfully and prophetically requires you to maintain an inner atmosphere of liberty
2169334 the kind of compassion jesus was said to have for people was not merely an expression of his will but rather an eruption from deep within his being out of this compassion of jesus sprang his mighty works of rescue healing and deliverance
2169335 lord i asked are most people myself included afraid fearful to pray for the sick because their understanding of your nature who you are and how you work inhibits them
2169336 yes most people are hesitant even fearful to pray for others healing because they misunderstand my compassion and mercy they know about me but they do not always know me
2169337 if you can everything is possible for him who believes
2169338 i do believe the father said help me overcome my unbelief
2169339 titus 3 5 says the lord saves us because of his mercy
2169340 steeped in humility we are called to act justly and to love mercy dont miss this justice is an action to be done in and through the power of christian community but mercy is to be loved it is not an action it is a passion
2169341 righteousness and justice are the foundation of your throne mercy and loving kindness and truth go before your face
2169342 this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins
2169343 and they the believers overcame him the accuser of the brethren because of the blood of the lamb and because of the word of their testimony and they did not love their life even to death
2169344 for the life of the flesh is in the blood
2169345 what have you done the voice of your brothers blood is crying to me from the ground
2169346 and with his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on it seven times and cleanse it and from the impurities of the sons of israel consecrate it
2169347 let the redeemed of the lord say so whom he has redeemed from the hand of the adversary
2169348 hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised is faithful
2169349 many keys fit many locks but the master key is the blood and the name of him that died and rose again and ever lives in haven to save unto the uttermost the blood of christ is that which unlocks the treasury of heaven
2169350 the steps of a righteous man are ordered by the lord
2169351 for the mountains may be removed and the hills may shake but my lovingkindness will not be removed from you and my covenant of peace will not be shaken
2169352 but this happened so that the work of god might be displayed in his life
2169353 you were steeped in sin at birth how dare you lecture us
2169354 patristic theology is not merely an oscillation between aristotle and plato
2169355 thomas aquinas roman catholic theologian 1225 1274 in his writings on intellectus intellect as a spiritual perceptual category implies the greek
2169356 in patristic literature of the east eastern christianity as in the eastern part of the roman empire under the see of constantinople western christianity being under the see of rome however the heart
2169357 conscience is a reflection of the divine image at the core of each person
2169358 you have to work and work and work for salvation
2169359 how do we know when we have reached the final stage of katharis greek cleansing purgation
2169360 i am the ever young i am that youth of a 1 000 summers
2169361 spiritual virtues that defend the heart are memory awareness watchfulness wakefulness attention hope faith and love a rule of prayer in daily life helps heal guard and unify the heart
2169362 purification of the heart is the striving to place under the rule of the heart the mind which represents the analytical and organisational aspect of consciousness
2169363 but blessed are your eyes because they see and your ears because they hear
2169364 there are no entirely private sins all sins are sins against my neighbour as well as against god and myself even my most secret thoughts are in fact making it more difficult for those around me to follow christ
2169365 come on visionary tell us which is greater apophatics saying without or kataphatics saying with and dont try to stall
2169366 cleanse my hidden mind greek nous the hidden man of my heart with the hyssop of your grace for i draw near to the holy of holies his opened side at calvary of your mysteries the communion of love
2169367 the continual and constant appeal is to the reality of christ of god incarnate experienced through the vision of faith what we have
2169368 you are opening my mind to revelation i can feel it
2169369 in a real sense a true biblical maverick acts in a prophetic manner by exposing the lies that the dominant group tells itself in order to sustain its shared illusions
2169370 son of man prophesy against the shepherds of israel prophesy and say to them this is what the sovereign lord says woe to the shepherds of israel who only take care of themselves should not shepherds take care of the flock
2169371 for this is what the sovereign lord says i myself will search for my sheep and look after them
2169372 as for you my flock this is what the sovereign lord says i will judge between one sheep and another and between rams and goats
2169373 therefore this is what the sovereign lord says to them see i myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep
2169374 i will make a covenant of peace with them and rid the land of wild beasts so that they may live in the desert and sleep in the forests in safety
2169375 prophesy to these bones and say to them o dry bones hear the word of the lord
2169376 surely i will cause breath to enter into you and you shall live
2169377 prophesy to the breath prophesy son of man and say to the breath thus says the lord god
2169378 son of man these bones are the whole house of israel they indeed say our bones are dry our hope is lost and we ourselves are cut off
2169379 behold o my people i will open your graves and cause you to come up from your graves and bring you into the land of israel
2169380 go back the way you came and go to the desert of damascus when you get there anoint hazael king over aram
2169381 the beloved of the lord shall dwell in safety by him who shelters her all the day long and she shall dwell between his shoulders
2169382 i see our walk with the lord as being more of a flow like a river instead of a series of starts and stops so this is how i currently perceive the spiritual and prophetic flow
2169383 the river rapids often stir up mud and debris which is symbolic of the chaos that reveals disorder but clarity always comes as god brings order out of chaos and clarity out of the confusion that reveals our iniquity
2169384 there is a might river of the spirit that flows with great force and power if we yield to the moving of the holy spirit he carries us to divine destiny
2169385 there are fresh springs feeding this mighty river which are symbolic of the lords abundance and blessings to those who are in right standing or right relationship with him
2169386 the wisdom of the pearlers an anthology of syriac christian mysticism cistercian studies brain e colless
2169387 jennifer does a bold insightful job of discerning the precious from the worthless jeremiah 15 19 yet also pursues us with the love of god
2169388 lord jesus christ son of god have mercy on me a sinner
2169389 i was in the city of joppa praying and in a trance i saw a vision an object coming down like a great sheet lowered by four corners from the sky and it came right down to me and when i had fixed my gaze on it and was observing it i saw the four footed animals of the earth and the wild beasts and the crawling creatures and the birds of the air
2169390 i also heard a voice saying to me get up peter kill and eat
2169391 but i said by no means lord for nothing unholy or unclean has ever entered my mouth
2169392 but a voice from heaven answered a second time what god has cleansed no longer consider unholy
2169393 this happened three times and everything was drawn back up into the sky
2169394 come up here and i will show you what must take place after these things
2169395 a casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything
2169396 i can guarantee this truth the son cannot do anything on his own he can do only what he sees the father doing indeed the son does exactly what the father does
2169397 i make use of the schema of purification illumination and theosis less frequently because i prefer the way fr sophrony presents the three stages of the spiritual life and the way they were prefigured in the history of israel since from the first moment the grace of god is at once purifying illuminating and deifying every touch of the spirit of god is light but there are different degrees so at every stage i think you get all three purification illumination and theosis and there is simply a varying degree of intensity of one kind over the other
2169398 the energy of the fire interpenetrates the sword the sword never becomes fire but it picks up the properties of the fire
2169399 blessed are you who circle in the waves of light and on the wings of the holy spirit and are enclosed in the all encompassing deep whose limits are unsearchable
2169400 the atoms of democritus and newtons particles of light are sands upon the red sea shore where israels tents do shine so bright
2169401 evangelical which is greater saying the jesus prayer lord jesus christ son of the living god have mercy on me a sinner or praying in tongues
2169402 if i speak in the tongues of men and of angels but have not love i am only a resounding gong or a clanging cymbal
2169403 they make mistakes because they do not have the key to interpret their experiences and the key is tradition
2169404 why do you call me lord lord and do not do what i say 47 i will show you what he is like who comes to me and hears my words and puts them into practice 48 he is like a man building a house who dug down deep and laid the foundation on rock when a flood came the torrent struck that house but could not shake it because it was well built 49 but the one who hears my words and does not put them into practice is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation the moment the torrent struck that house it collapsed and its destruction was complete
2169405 the true and holy tradition is not reduced only to a verbal and visible transmission of teachings rites and institutions but it is at the same time an invisible and actual communication of grace and sanctification
2169406 the archimandrite has said in his book the hidden man of the heart that
2169407 as evangelicals are we simply just word and spirit people and nothing more
2169408 are you soundly word based and do you preach the gospel faithfully
2169409 all scripture is god breathed and is useful for teaching rebuking correcting and training in righteousness
2169410 if all scripture is god breathed in and through the holy spirit how can we understand it and preach it faihfully unless we are led by the holy spirit and holy spirit filled
2169411 i do not believe we can have a pure church
2169412 mercy triumphs over judgement james 2 13 but genesis 13 14 the lord said to abram after lot had parted separated from him lift up your eyes from where you are and look north and south east and west we may need as evangelicals in the church of england to look at radical ecumenical initiatives and look to
2169413 an orthodox apologist is a guardian not only of dogmatic symbols but of spiritual life and faith the orthodox creed is real only within the trinity of faith life and spirit before taking part in a religious dispute about truth or about certain aspects of it an apologist must take stock not only of his ideas and knowledge but of his own spiritual condition as well if his spirit is clouded with vanity bitterness irritability pride contempt for others even if they be heretics an orthodox apologist cannot count himself worthy to come forth as a champion of orthodoxy when approaching truth i e the divine flame burning in the midst of a bush but not consuming it an apologist puts his shoes from off his feet he puts off carnal feelings thoughts and desires touching the flame of truth i e becoming a preacher of it he burns with its fire everything in himself which is out of keeping with its spirit
2169414 the thing that will move god more on the day of judgement is the work each one of us has done on his old man
2169415 all of life is about connections within each contact the relationship we have with the lord becomes the prime means of developing the kingdom in people prophetic individuals must learn how to impart life power and significance to people around them we are all catalysts for something to happen authentic prophetic people connect with deliberate intentionality their anointing shapes the lives of the people that the father puts around them
2169416 tyger tyger burning bright in the forests of the night what immortal hand or eye could frame thy fearful symmetry in what distant deeps or skies burnt the fire of thine eyes on what wings dare he aspire what the hand dare seize the fire and what shoulder and what art could twist the sinews of thy heart and when thy heart began to beat what dread hand and what dread feet what the hammer what the chain in what furnace was thy brain what the anvil what dread grasp dare its deadly terrors clasp when the stars threw down their spears and watered heaven with their tears did he smile his work to see did he who made the lamb make thee tyger tyger burning bright in the forests of the night what immortal hand or eye dare frame thy fearful symmetry
2169417 the teaching is clear for the father of sin is called a serpent by holy scripture and what is born of the serpent is certainly a serpent it follows that sin is synonymous with the one who begot it but the apostolic word testifies that the lord was made into sin for our sake by being invested with our sinful nature this figure is rightly applied to the lord for if sin is a serpent and the lord became sin the logical conclusion should be evident toall by becoming sin he became also a serpent which is nothing other than sin
2169418 the bible is the mind of the ancient church it is the mind of the fathers
2169419 the teaching is clear for the father of sin is called a serpent by holy scripture and what is born of the serpent is certainly a serpent it follows that sin is synonymous with the one who begot it but the apostolic word testifies that the lord was made into sin for our sake by being invested with our sinful nature this figure is rightly applied to the lord for if sin is a serpent and the lord became sin the logical conclusion should be evident toall by becoming sin he became also a serpent which is nothing other than sin
2169420 i am ruined for i am a man of unclean lips and i live among a people of unclean lips and my eyes have seen the king the lord almighty
2169421 his winnowing fork is in his hand to thoroughly clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire
2169422 many of the religious people of his day could be heard complaining about billys dancing and shouting
2169423 as i go along the street i lift up one foot and it seems to say glory and i lift up the other and it seems to say amen and so they keep on like that all the time i am walking
2169424 if they were to put me in a barrel i would shout glory out through the bung hole

2169426 in the spirit you shall see the son in the son you shall recognise the father in the light of th spirit you shall see the effulgence of my glory in the image the archetype from your own selves the superessential
2169427 god may be known by his energies but his essence remains inaccessible to human beings
2169428 father forgive them for they know not what they do
2169429 if ppl do it then why not me its okay
2169430 even if youre not a genius you can use the same strategies as aristotle and einstein to harness the power of your creative mind and better manage your future

2169434 the bad debt management helped offset weakness in expense management elsewhere

2169437 partnering with imagineer systems at nab is a perfect opportunity for everyone to see our products working well together
2169438 the launch of mogul is a watershed event for imagineer systems not only because of the technological feat weve accomplished but for the fact that we reached this goal in such lock step with our customers listening to every requirement on their wish list for the ideal vfx system and a key element on every customers wish list is a silent system
2169439 gizmac shares our dedication to customer requirements and that dedication is evident in the standard theyve set for ultimate noise reduction with the xrackpro2

2169445 when you look properly you will see that they do not represent a major turnaround for the company the second quarter results only look extraordinary as two very large projects in spain and south korea have finally reached the balance sheet
2169446 these are very strong operational figures but only for a specific quarter
2169447 wait and see where they are at the end of the year
2169448 after nine months of restructuring we are considerably more focused and dynamic
2169449 italy has been toying since the middle of last year
2169450 two consecutive quarters of negative gdp growth would constitute a recession and this is quite possible
2169451 we expect inflation to reach 3 8 in the third quarter
2169452 though the reason for the spin off was a tax change in luxembourg which made it necessary the family are showing that they have faith that the luxury business is still a very good business
2169453 this is very positive news and comes earlier than expected in november they said they wanted to do this but did not specify when they would and gave a time limit up until 2010

2169458 youd get halfway there halfway there halfway there but you never really get there thats what it felt like
2169459 we anticipate that it will be signed prior to the groundbreaking
2169460 we approved the concept that weve been talking about for many months and particularly the authoritys responsibility under the agreement
2169461 people took a stand and made sure there was a benefit
2169462 i really dont think this cba goes far enough in my opinion
2169463 the terms of the community benefits agreement are all positive for the hill district community if theres any disagreement its that some people think it should be more positive thats all

2169471 the challenges presented to us by the increasing cost of fuel have had a huge impact on our budget
2169472 we have revisited our bridges from a maintenance standpoint we want to extend bridge life
2169473 we are cleaning our bridges once a year getting underneath and cleaning salt and debris from birds we are doing more vegetation removal to keep channels open and clean and keep the water flowing
2169474 we have rededicated ourselves to bridges over the last year
2169475 and hand in hand with that is focusing on the maintenance of highways we need longer pavement life of our roadways due to current funding levels we must be more proactive about maintaining roadways

2169489 i could see the hardships they had to put up with
2169490 when the snow was deep no trains or trolleys were running and we walked everywhere
2169491 e government is one of those catchy trendy buzzwords in the internet industry and people like myself are trying to make inroads in that area
2169492 statistics show people are coming back in october when we launched the site we got 250 300 visits a day in may we had over 1 800 visits
2169493 we want to be a tree city usa and we want beautiful trees but we dont have enough in our budget to take care of them
2169494 we were backpedaling trying to get away we probably had about four seconds and the tree kind of shifted hitting other trees in the canopy
2169495 we were hurt but not seriously the tree left scratches we could immediately see what looked like brush burns and scratches on our necks on my hands
2169496 my 8 year old took the worst of it and she cant remember much she must have thrown her arms up she had bruises on the insides of them
2169497 ive been told that the nature conservancy wants nature to be nature so if a tree is damaged or dead it should fall on its own
2169498 i for one have spent a lot of time in the woods in my life and i had always assumed there had to be a catastrophe like a lightning strike or high wind to topple a tree
2169499 regarding the situation in bird park in particular i have talked with lori
2169500 if someone calls up and says there is a hazard a limb has fallen well get out there we will interrupt our regular work schedule
2169501 but if its just a standard tree trim thats something that is scheduled
2169502 a lot of people use those parks and we hear from them believe me from regular people who find things they consider dangerous
2169503 there is a sleep over in bird park my son always goes to they have it through the mt lebanon recreation department
2169504 but we are hoping to have an agreement in place by late fall
2169505 its a substantial investment and it only makes sense that we would want to reach as many customers as possible with our new services
2169506 we will be negotiating with them to determine where they start
2169507 in the future we will look to see what we can do to expand offerings
2169508 we think we are very competitive and when you get competition consumers win
2169509 we knew this was coming and were going to compete for every inch of the territory
2169510 the single business is alive and well and its in the form of track downloads
2169511 for me growing up there was nothing like listening to an album that you could literally sit down and listen to from the beginning to the end
2169512 it cant just be about singles thats the purpose of an album its almost like a story within itself
2169513 im so all about going to the store and buy a cd
2169514 people arent going to do records theyre just going to do singles probably
2169515 we tried to stop selling a commercial single because people were making great great records and albums were selling like hotcakes
2169516 the notion that someone would jump to an album length purchase because they couldnt find the one song they wanted available was a naive one
2169517 people are going after one hit they are not really caring what the album sounds like they are not into artist development anymore if us as an industry went and started developing talent again and not worrying about one hit it would be more than a singles driven business again
2169518 were making disposable music you cant make disposable music again and again and again and again and not expect anything to happen we have these huge radio records and then wont sell any records
2169519 if youre making just songs theyll listen to it in the clubs thats great theyll listen to it in their car thats beautiful will they buy it no

2169522 i havent done anything because we havent played anyone yet
2169523 its practice so of course we go hard but the coaches want to see what you can do when the lights go on its big for rookies because you want to show that you know the defense and can play the system im looking forward to it im excited
2169524 for the older guys if youve been around the block a couple of times you know what youre going to have to do when you get out there play a couple of plays during the preseason and be healthy for the regular season
2169525 what we are doing out here live in practice is more important preseason is tough because you arent really game planning
2169526 i want to look at guys who are trying to make this team and how that second and third group plays who shines
2169527 were looking for some good backup people at linebacker we have five safeties so i think there is great competition those guys are going to play a lot especially guys like sean considine j r reed and quintin demps we have to kind of sort that out
2169528 then i think its going to be beneficial for a guy like mcdougle who i think is having a great preseason well see how he does in a game the whole preseason is big for him
2169529 you know all i can do is take care of the things that i can control
2169530 its been so long since i played a game im just looking forward to getting pressure on a quarterback again

2169566 were saying newspapers will go online and there will be massive innovation that comes out of that
2169567 were saying that tv the biggest ad market in the world will completely go online and have the kind of targeting interaction that you only get out on the web today
2169568 as dramatic as things happening on the web are thats actually what all advertising will be in the future
2169569 i have a lot of friends in the newspaper industry and of course this is a tough wrenching change for them because the number of people who actually buy subscribe to the newspaper and read it has started an inexorable decline
2169570 the timeline between now and when that happens i think is questionable
2169571 i know that the newspaper industry is definitely going through an evolution but theres still a tremendous amount of circulation in some of these markets
2169572 there are very few companies that have such a wide range of digital assets that you can run messaging across all those platforms
2169573 thats the code that theyre trying to crack and if they do theyll be unmatched
2169574 theyre doing lots of stuff right but i think you can argue that they dont have nearly the range of assets that a microsoft brings to the party
2169575 in this environment the ads will be targeted not just targeted to the neighborhood level but well actually know who the viewers of that show are

2169598 saat itu saya keluar untuk mengetahui apa yang terjadi tak tahunya suara keras itu berasal dari gerbang pagar ditabrak truk dan setelah itu ratusan orang keluar masuk ke kampus
2169599 saya sempat ditodong pakai senjata api saya diseret dan dipukuli puluhan orang sampai ke halaman depan tangan saya diborgol di pagar entah kenapa salah seorang pelaku mengatakan bahwa saya bukan helmi yang mereka cari
2169600 saya tidak mengenal mereka saya sempat berteriak karena menahan penyiksaan itu tangan kiri saya diborgol di pagar dan ditinggalkan begitu saja saya berhasil lepas dan lari ke rs permata bunda karena borgol bisa saya buka
2169601 nasib roni tidak kami ketahui sampai sekarang mereka sungguh kejam dan bukan manusia
2169602 mereka juga merampas tas saya yang berisikan uang rp 1 juta untuk membayar uang kuliah anak saya di fakultas ekonomi semester ii hp serta uang rp 20 ribu di saku celana saya menyesalkan sikap seperti ini gara gara internal kampus orang tak berdosa yang kena imbasnya
2169603 orang orang itu masuk dan memaksa membubarkan siswa yang lagi ujian
2169604 saya melihat 3 truk entah dari mana datang dengan ratusan orang berpakaian sekuriti ala preman merusak gerbang
2169605 itu terjadi kemarin saat orang sedang shalat dzuhur ini tindakan yahudi bentrok kok pakai nama nama tuhan dan mengganggu ketenangan orang kenapa petugas polisi tidak berani masuk mengamankan sekuriti ala preman itu
2169606 mereka melakukan pengrusakan terhadap brankas kemudian melakukan pengutipan secara ilegal kepada mahasiswa merusak fasilitas milik yayasan seperti ruangan dan lain lain
2169607 perpanjangan kepengurusan yayasan harus dilakukan secara resmi di depan notaris
2169608 jadi sedikitnya ada uang sebesar rp 17 5 miliar yang harus dipertanggungjawabkan kepada umat jadi kami yakin hal inilah yang ditakuti hj syariani yakni bila hal ini terbongkar dan mereka tidak bisa mempertanggungjawabkannya
2169609 sekarang pertanggungjawabannya ke mana hal ini harus diaudit oleh akuntan publik
2169610 mereka sudah habis waktu dan biaya bila hal ini dibiarkan berlanjut lanjut maka nasib mereka akan semakin terkatung katung
2169611 kami juga melihat betapa mahasiswa histeris melihat keadaan kampus yang hancur akibat situasi terjadi yang berada di luar etika dan norma norma ajaran islam
2169612 kami minta dewan turun tangan menyelesaikan kampus uisu apalagi bapak bapak telah turun ke lokasi melihat situasi dan kondisi di kampus kami yang carut marut akibat terjadinya penyerangan
2169613 kami akan mengupayakan penyelesaian terbaik atas kericuhan yang terjadi di uisu
2169614 dari defisit energi 100 300 mw berarti akan terjadi lagi pemadaman kita minta pemadaman jangan pada waktu waktu tertentu seperti adzan maghrib demikian halnya bulan ramadhan jatuh pada awal september 2007 agar tidak terjadi pemadaman
2169615 masalah terulangnya pemadaman listrik di sumut perlu diinformasikan kepada masyarakat sampai ke desa desa dengan mundurnya jadwal operasional penambahan energi dari genset yang disewa agar masyarakat tahu penyebab dari pemadaman tersebut
2169616 masalah plta asahan iii terkait izin prinsip dari gubsu belum keluar dprd sumut akan melakukan pertemuan dengan gubsu membahas masalah izin prinsip untuk asahan iii agar masalah krisis listrik di sumut sedikit terobati demikian halnya masalah sewa genset sudah diperjuangkan komisi d ke pusat telah dipenuhi dengan genset kapasitas pembelian energi sebesar 80 mw tapi realisasinya terjadi kemunduran akibat proses tender penyediaan genset tersebut
2169617 kita berharap masalah ini segera diselesaikan karena kita sudah muak mendengar masalah yang tak kunjung selesai ini dan berharap dengan menemui presiden dan meneg bumn masalahnya dapat segera diselesaikan
2169618 berbagai upaya telah kita coba untuk menyelesaikannya tetapi selalu kandas karenanya jalan terakhir yang akan kita tempuh adalah dengan menemui presiden sekaligus meneg bumn dan kepala bpn
2169619 kita akan menemui presiden meneg bumn dan kepala bpn untuk meminta agar klausul yang menjadi penyebab terkendalanya pengembalian lahan eks hgu itu dihapuskan saja rencananya kita akan ke jakarta sekitar pertengahan juni nanti
2169620 tanpa terlebih dahulu mendata lahan bermasalah maka persoalan sengketa lahan yang kini menyelimuti ptpn ii tidak akan pernah bisa selesai dengan cepat
2169621 kami tidak menyangka jika air datang begitu besar dan bahkan membawa bongkahan batu dan kayu kayu besar dari hulu sungai selama ini sungai tersebut tidak pernah ditakuti masyarakat membawa banjir seperti ini karena debit airnya cukup kecil
2169622 begitu mendengar ada suara aneh saya mencoba keluar rumah untuk memastikan apa yang terjadi belum sempat buka pintu tiba tiba air sudah menghantam bagian dapur rumah kami pun sempat terperangkap namun dengan segala upaya kami bisa lari menyelamatkan diri dari kepungan air bah untung kami selamat apalagi saya ini sudah tua
2169623 rumah saya hancur dihantam batu besar begitu juga puluhan ternak babi dan ayam semuanya ludes banjir seperti ini tidak pernah terjadi walaupun curah hujan tinggi peristiwa ini benar benar mengherankan
2169624 yang penting jangan kita cari apa penyebab terjadinya banjir bandang ini kita prihatin dengan musibah ini
2169625 karena pengesahan apbd 2007 sumut lambat maka upah selama lima bulan ini belum saya terima sehingga untuk menghidupi keluarga pun terpaksa saya harus meminjam ke tetangga dulu
2169626 kami tak tahu kenapa upah tersebut belum dicairkan padahal rekan di unit lain selalu menerima tiap bulan kalau karena apbd 2007 sumut lambat disahkan kok mereka yang di unit lain bisa menerima upah apa bedanya mereka dengan kami
2169627 saya hanya tahu kalau upah pegawai honor di pemprov sumut dialokasikan pada apbd 2007 sumut sedangkan untuk gaji pns diperoleh dari dana alokasi umum sehingga walau pun apbd 2007 sumut belum disahkan pencairan gaji pns atau pegawai honor yang diangkat menjadi pns tidak pernah terkendala
2169628 bagi mereka yang menjadi cpns ini tidak lagi menerima upah sebesar rp 761 ribu per bulan melainkan gaji plus tunjangan lainnya yang besarannya disesuaikan dengan pangkat dan golongan masing masing
2169629 ke 16 honorer yang menjadi cpns itu 11 di antaranya berada di biro pemerintahan dan lima lagi di biro umum
2169630 saya mendapat kabar sekira pukul 03 30 wib suami saya tidak ada pamit malam sebelum kejadian saya tidak tahu kemana perginya
2169631 kita akan meminta surat rekomendasi penolakan pembentukan protap kepada gubsu dan akan membawanya juga ke jakarta sebab gubsu juga telah mengeluarkan surat kepada panitia pembentukan protap
2169632 kita hanya melakukan audensi dan berdelegasi kepada gubsu untuk meminta surat tersebut jadi apa yang telah dilakukan panitia pembentukan protap itu kita juga akan melakukannya agar dapat dijadikan perbandingan jika mereka meminta kepada ketua dprd sumut dan gubsu surat rekomendasi pembentukan protap maka kita juga akan minta surat rekomendasi penolakan protap kepada ketua dprd sumut dan gubsu
2169633 sangat lawak lawak jika mereka panitia pembentukan protap red menyatakan pembentukan protap untuk kesejahteraan rakyat
2169634 jadi jangan dipaksakan pembentukan protap itu jika rakyat tidak mau kecuali dia ingin membuat provinsi sendiri misalnya katakanlah provinsi batak toba jangan dicampur campur dengan orang lain yang tidak menginginkan pembentukan protap
2169635 data mereka yang tidak lengkap seperti halnya sudah ada penelitian yang dilakukan pada tahun 2004 yang menyatakan tidak layak untuk dibentuk tapi kenapa mereka melakukan penelitian kembali yang hanya melibatkan mereka tidak melibatkan para pakar sedangkan tim peneliti yang dibentuk tahun 2004 melibatkan pemprovsu ilmuan akademisi tokoh adat tokoh agama serta ahli ekonomi yang menyatakan protap tidak layak
2169636 jika gubsu tidak mengeluarkan surat rekomendasi penolakan itu kita akan mempertanyakan kenapa gubsu dapat mengeluarkan surat rekomendasi pembentukan protap kami juga masyarakat tapanuli tengah yang berada di wilayah tapanuli
2169637 tidak segampang itu membentuk protap sebab masih ada juga masyarakat yang menolak pembentukan protap dan ini harus dipertimbangkan oleh dpr ri
2169638 good riddens to them they deserve to have their accounts banned and erased

2169697 ada dua perkara apabila terdapat dalam diri seseorang maka allah menulisnya sebagai orang yang syukur lagi sabar
2169698 meninggalkan kenikmatan dunia lebih pahit dari pada sabar dan lebih berat daripada memukulkan pedang di jalan allah dan tiada sekali kali orang mahu meninggalkan kenikmatan dunia melainkan allah akan memberi sesuatu seperti yang diberikan kepada para syuhada dan meninggalkan kenikmatan dnia adalah dengan menyedikitkan makan dan kekenyangan dan membenci pujian manusia karena sesungguhnya orang yang suka di puji oleh manusia adalah termasuk mencintai dunia dan kenikmatannya dan barang siapa menginginkan kenikmatan yang sesungguhnya maka hendaklah ia meninggalkan kenikmatan dunia dan pujian dari manusia
2169699 barang siapa yang niatnya adalah untuk akhirat niscaya allah akan mengumpulkan kekuatan baginya dan allah membuat hatinya menjadi kaya dan dunia akan mendatanginya dalam keadaan hina dan barang siapa yang niatnya dunia maka allah akan menceraiberaikan segala urusannya dan allah menjadikan kefakiran di depan kedua belah matanya dan tiadalah dunia akan mendatanginya kecuali apa yang telah tertulis untuknya
2169700 sesungguhnya aku melihat rasulullah saw di dalam tidur dan sungguh beliau saw telah mencium syaikh abu bakr as syibly ketika itu berdirilah nabi saw di depan as syibly dan beliau mencium antara kedua mataas syibly maka aku bertanya yaa rasulullah apakah benar engkau berbuat yang demikian terhadap as syibly rasulullah saw menjawab benar sesungguhnya dia tidak sekali kali mengerjakan shalat fardhu melainkan setelah itu membaca laqad jaa a kum rasuulum min anfusikum aziizun alaihi maa anittum chariisun alaikum bil mukminiinarrauufurrahiim faintawallau faqul chasbiyallaahu laailaaha illa huwa alaihi tawakkaltu wahuwa rabbul arsyil adziim setelah itu dia as syibly mengucapkan salam shallallaahu alaika yaa muhammad
2169701 it looks in fact very much as if both parties had in mind some kind of law or rule of fair play or decent behaviour ormorality or whatever you like to call it about which they really agreed
2169702 the idea was that just as all bodies are governed by the law of gravitation and organisms by biological laws so the creature called man also had his law with this great difference that a body could not choose whether it obeyed the law of gravitation or not but a man could choose either to obey the law of human nature or to disobey it
2169703 that is he cannot disobey those laws which he shares with other things but the law which is peculiar to his human nature the law he does not share with animals or vegetables or inorganic things is the one he can disobey if he chooses
2169704 i know that some people say the idea of a law of nature or decent behaviour known to all men is unsound because different civilisations and different ages have had quite different moralities
2169705 if anyone will take the trouble to compare the moral teaching of say the ancient egyptians babylonians hindus chinese greeks and romans what will really strike him will be how very like they are to each other and to our own
2169706 none of us are really keeping the law of nature
2169707 these then are the two points i wanted to make first that human beings all over the earth have this curious idea that they ought to behave in a certain way and cannot really get rid of it secondly that they do not in fact behave in that way they know the law of nature they break it these two facts are the foundation of all clear thinking about ourselves and the universe we live in
2169708 you will probably feel two desires one a desire to give help due to your herd instinct the other a desire to keep out of danger due to the instinct for self preservation but you will find inside you in addition to these two impulses a third thing which tells you that you ought to follow the impulse to help and suppress the impulse to run away
2169709 you might as well say that the sheet of music which tells you at a given moment to play one note on the piano and not another is itself one of the notes on the keyboard
2169710 you probably want to be safe much more than you want to help the man who is drowning but the moral law tells you to help him all the same and surely it often tells us to try to make the right impulse stronger than it naturally is
2169711 the moral law is not any one instinct or any set of instincts it is something which makes a kind of tune the tune we call goodness or right conduct by directing the instincts
2169712 i fully agree that we learn the rule of decent behaviour from parents and teachers and friends and books as we learn everything else but some of the things we learn are mere conventions which might have been different we learn to keep to the left of the road but it might just as well have been the rule to keep to the right and others of them like mathematics are real truths the question is to which class the law of human nature belongs
2169713 the moment you say that one set of moral ideas can be better than another you are in fact measuring them both by a standard saying that one of them conforms to that standard more nearly than the other but the standard that measures two things is something different from either you are in fact comparing them both with some real morality admitting that there is such a thing as a real right independent of what people think and that some peoples ideas get nearer to that real right than others
2169714 i conclude then that though the differences between peoples ideas of decent behaviour often make you suspect that there is no real natural law of behaviour at all yet the things we are bound to think about these differences really prove just the opposite
2169715 i am trying to find out truth and from that point of view the very idea of something being imperfect of its not being what it ought to be has certain consequences
2169716 the law of gravity tells you what stones do if you drop them but the law of human nature tells you what human beings ought to do and do not
2169717 some people say that though decent conduct does not mean what pays each particular person at a particular moment still it means what pays the human race as a whole
2169718 it is perfectly true that safety and happiness can only come from
2169719 why should i care whats good for society except when it happens to pay me personally
2169720 the gates of heaven are narrow while the ones to hell are broad
2169721 peoplewho take that view think that matter and space just happen to exist andalways have existed nobody knows why and that the matter behaving in certain fixed ways has just happened by a sort of fluke to produce creatures like ourselves who are able to think by one chance in a thousand something hit our sun and made it produce the planets and by another thousandth chance the chemicals necessary for life and the right temperature occurred on one of these planets and so some of the matter on this earth came alive and then by a very long series of chances the living creatures developed into things like us
2169722 according to it what is behind the universe is more like a mind than it is like anything else we know
2169723 that is to say it is conscious and has purposes and prefers one thing to another and on this view it made the universe partly for purposes we do not know but partly at any rate in order to produce creatures like itself i mean like itself to the extent of having minds
2169724 you cannot find out which view is the right one by science in the ordinary sense
2169725 but why anything comes to be there at all and whether there is anything behind
2169726 now the position would be quite hopeless but for this there is one thing and only one in the whole universe which we know more about than we could learn from external observation that one thing is man we do not merely observe men we are men in this case we have so to speak inside information we are in the know and because of that we know that men find themselves under a moral law which they did not make and cannot quite forget even when they try and which they know they ought to obey notice the following point anyone studying man from the outside as we study electricity or cabbages not knowing our language and consequently not able to get any inside knowledge from us but merely observing what we did would never get the slightest evidence that we had this moral law how could he for his observations would only show what we did and the moral law is about what we ought to do in the same way if there were anything above or behind the observed facts in the case of stones or the weather we by studying them from outside could never hope to discover it
2169727 suppose someone asked me when i see a man in a blue uniform going down the street leaving little paper packets at each house why i suppose that they contain letters
2169728 because whenever he leaves a similar little packet for me i find it does contain a letter
2169729 but youve never seen all these letters which you think the other people are getting
2169730 of course not and i shouldnt expect to because theyre not addressed to me im explaining the packets im not allowed to open by the ones i am allowed to open
2169731 we all want progress but progress means getting nearer to the place where you want to be and if you have taken a wrong turning then to go forward does not get you any nearer if you are on the wrong road progress means doing an about turn and walking back to the right road and in that case the man who turns back soonest is the most progressive man we have all seen this when doing arithmetic when i have started a sum the wrong way the sooner i admit this and go back and start over again the faster i shall get on there is nothing progressive about being pigheaded and refusing to admit a mistake and i think if you look at the present state of the world it is pretty plain that humanity has been making some big mistake we are on the wrong road and if that is so we must go back going back is the quickest way on
2169732 we have only got as far as a somebody or something behind the moral law
2169733 if you look for truth you may find comfort in the end if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin with and in the end despair
2169734 i will take 2 bags of gummy worms and 1 bag of extra hot fireball jawbreakers

2169775 people are scared that the police will cause you harm so no one calls them
2169776 the fact that the army is fielding complaints that it is investigating that its detaining people on its own all of that is against the law
2169777 theres a perception that the army is our savior however i believe it shouldnt be that way the police should be doing this work

2169884 the result has not been a contented streamlined nation humming with efficiency and gleaming with modernity
2169885 the result has been an explosion of bureaucracy cost and irritation endless upheavals and pointless reorganisations the elbowing aside of colourful human informal relationships based on common sense and trust in favour of the grey mechanical joyless mantras of the master planner with his calculations projections and impact assessments
2169886 all this because we live under a regime that prizes bureaucratic neatness above all else
2169887 a regime indeed a whole culture that it has spawned which knows the price of everything and the value of nothing
2169888 we have agreed to play the tri series in bangladesh i think it can be played in 2008 or 2009
2169889 we have to make some adjustments to the icc calendar the bcb bangladesh cricket board has readily agreed to all the conditions put before them

2169895 mujtaba says that pakistan is not the same country you see on television
2169896 and this is the perfect opportunity to see the people who helped make our contribution possible and also gain a better understanding of pakistan
2169897 many of us felt it would be good to have further discussion with the developer
2169898 i think theyre misguided my whole point was to give sonics fans a voice but unless they want to kick in and do the rest im not going to make the numbers

2169903 its only been one day cricket for us over the past year we have not played test matches in that period and it will be tough to adjust quickly but we will do our best
2169904 we played some good cricket over the last 13 months winning a good number odis helped to build confidence but players must apply themselves to adjust to test cricket
2169905 the players are still not versatile enough because they bat well in the first innings but not in the second which is much tougher they still havent acquired this skill completely but it will happen with the help of the four day games in domestic cricket

2169913 being teenage girls its easy to relate to what theyre saying
2169914 teenagers grow up a lot faster but i still think people should go back to the lyrics and consider them in their own lives
2169915 its something that you cant find nowadays and its great to bring that to people
2169916 its teenage music written by teenagers and you cant get purer than that
