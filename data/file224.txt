2240000 buyers now have an overwhelming advantage given the wide selection of homes available in many markets
2240001 but with profit margins coming under pressure homebuilders will limit new construction well into 2008 this should help the overall inventory level to move steadily into a more balanced state
2240002 markets that sharply reduce new construction in 2007 will generally experience respectable price increases in 2008

2240007 value based education in school curriculum and also in teacher training programme
2240008 the education which does not help the common mass of the people to equip themselves for the struggles of life which does not bring out strength of character a spirit of philanthropy and the courage of lion is it worth the name real education is that which enables one to stand on his own legs
2240009 values cannot be forced even if conveyed with good intentions no real integration or internalization of a value can be achieved unless the learner agrees with it communication is the key in this this is one tradition we lack in india but it can be developed with the co operation of all in value education more than in the academics educators will never be able to impose their values rather they must circulate in the community of the learner and pass on through discipline the fine humanism of respecting others in the same manner that one expects to be respected in return as this climate of respect surrounds the learners they automatically imbibe an attitude of tolerance towards their fellow men

2240017 the move came after maliki who leads a shia dominated government dropped his long opposition to absorption of sahwa members in government forces

2240208 the justice of god is both an essential and a relative attribute of the divine existence it is a necessary outflow from the holiness of god it is that in positive form that is negatively described as holiness or separateness from evil and further it is the holiness of god as manifested and applied in moral government

2240255 the path i took was the path that was necessary to do what i was doing
2240256 10 million instead of 200 million if that were the standard
2240257 i think that most of the people running companies today are motivated and pay is a small portion of the motivation

2240341 young man because you have sought the lord with your whole heart a few things are about to be added unto you things that you have longed for and craved for quite a while now one of which is a wife

2240343 gene can i give you a little piece of advice about this woman your heart wants

2240347 academic title i would place a computerized smiley face here but want to avoid that rather obnoxious yellow symbol

2240361 ive got this bitch in my ethics class who is driving me up the wall picking over every little thing i mean she holds up the whole class on these stupid details the other day she was comparing this guy shoveling snow off her car hood she didnt ask him to he just came over and started doing it and she told him you know that no she could do it herself but he did the whole job anyway so she compared that to rape how she said no but he did it anyway i mean come the fuck on you cant even be a nice guy its a lose lose situation
2240362 i dont know so the books wouldnt take up as much space i guess
2240363 thats a really tedious stupid thing to do isnt it just for some space
2240364 are all that way see the shelves are only four inches deep we needed the room
2240365 funny you know what a weird thing happened actually i forgot i just remembered it now
2240366 well i was sitting next to this old man he must have been like fifty or something and he was reading the economist and i kept eyeing it because the cover story was about guantanamo bay and we started talking a little it was nice
2240367 well anyway he asked if i wanted to read it and then he told me i was lovely looking just like that he said lovely
2240368 who says lovely he was old right how old did you say
2240369 im not finished it wasnt sleazy he said i looked like his late wife
2240370 but this is the thing he asked me if i would mind if he put his hand on my knee while he slept
2240371 no it wasnt like that what youre thinking it was sincere
2240372 jesus christ i cant believe you just buy this kind of shit when were together i mean when were out of school and all this long distance stuff is over you better stop doing this sort of shit you always do stuff like this just buy these lines think things are more than just sex god
2240373 youre so naive i mean with men you have no idea
2240374 so then you let him you let him put his hand on your knee did he bring his hand up your leg accidentally while he was sleeping
2240375 no it was fine it was nothing i think my mannerisms were just comforting to him whys that a big deal i didnt mean for it to be a big deal it was just a story
2240376 youre too fucking trustworthy you cant just let the world go around fucking you because you feel bad for it
2240377 it wasnt like that youre not even seeing the point the scene of it was just so lonely looking like a painting the two of us like that on a train
2240378 not me the whole thing the moment it was all so lonely
2240379 god i cant believe you sometimes youre so weird with shit like that
2240380 what do you think they do with the other halves

2240383 sebentar lagi anda akan ditunjukkan dengan sebuah sistem lengkap yang akan membantu melipatgandakan pendapatan internet anda
2240384 i can see him in there hes just deep in it i can see him though hes a mess its a mess
2240385 i mean up until three months ago he had been using for the last two years it was pretty serious he was married he got married really young and she got into heroin brian never touched it they had two kids and brian was doing everything working taking care of the kids taking care of her everything and then finally she left him just like that just disappeared and thats when brian tried it like he wanted to know what this thing was you know this thing that ruined his life and he got into it pretty deep he lost his kids his parents pretty much dropped him but then he heard about matthew and it all stopped i mean slam on the brakes stopped hes clean now hes devoted everything to matthew him and his mom i dont know i wanted to tell you that in case it came up there
2240386 so many good people are praying to our lord and youve helped us god knows youve helped us you brought matthew back matthew had bled out you know when the medics arrived matthew had bled out when they got him to germany he was gone he was gone for one month and then you brought him back this is matthews rebirth and its our rebirth too its the time for our rebirth and i thank the lord for that just look at brian for proof hes a new man a completely new man
2240387 his legs were blown off who the hell does she thinks wants to steal him
2240388 so its sort of like were going to sort of sneak in brian will help us but like
2240389 i didnt blame him for wanting to go ice skating that evening
2240390 matthews still totally full from the ice cream social earlier arent you buddy
2240391 we got so lost in boston im still shaking i was driving stick can you believe that stick i cant even drive automatic and we were going in all these tunnels we ended up at the airport
2240392 but then two months later he got it blown off you should see if you can get a refund can you imagine going back to the tattoo parlor id bet theyd give you another one for free
2240393 mattys a celebrity caitlyn i dont know how much of this you know but matts been on i swear every news channel he was on fox news
2240394 when we get back to the apartment ill show you the album my mom is making of the newspaper clippings i mean hes been in everything
2240395 want to meet my pat hes right down the hall hes still awake i think hes excited about the whole secret mission of sneaking you girls in
2240396 we live on the same floor in the apartment and we met in the elevator i mean his face was familiar because we were both doing the same thing waking up coming to the hospital all day going home going to bed over and over you know and finally i said something there are a lot of us at that apartment the government pushed us all in there
2240397 you know its nice and its close to the hospital but mostly its the wives and a lot of them are just i dont know its a lot for a person brians different though we can have fun together you have to have fun or youre going to break youre going to completely melt down well get some beers after and
2240398 just like matthew you just gotve thank god there was no shrapnel youve no idea whats that like how dirty just one piece those injuries its hard to imagine
2240399 we dont have to hide anyone in the bathroom i dont think ashley will be in tonight she usually leaves around suppertime it wouldve been funny can you imagine if you girls were holed up in his bathroom that was a good idea honey
2240400 brian and i had the whole escape plan routed out it was like an army mission
2240401 hes our miracle they came to my door upstate and i saw them coming in their uniforms and
2240402 they said there was a roadside bomb everyone in the humvee was dead
2240403 before that it was a normal day before things that mattered i was upset we were out of coffee beans thats what was on my mind before i saw them driving up the coffee beans and the lawn needed mowing but then a month later matthew came back to us he woke up in germany
2240404 you gave brian back to us he found his way his purpose in all this hes a caregiver thats why he was put on this earth and now we know it how he treats matthew when you dont know your purpose it can be hard
2240405 matthews so fucking proud hes getting 100 000 from the army and im like jesus fucking christ you dont have your legs you lost your legs
2240406 sorry there is no one to rage to here you know
2240407 im not going to tell this to mom or anything
2240408 i told matthew id be his legs i told him from now id be his legs hes my life now you know hes my baby brother
2240409 its great that the tele has opened up this debate but it must not become last weeks story if anyone was in any doubt about the importance of independent housing associations they shouldnt be now
2240410 if you want something done about it you will have to do it yourselves
2240411 people should be getting together deciding for themselves what the agenda is deciding what information they want and pursuing it
2240412 every housing association in dundee would fundamentally disagree that theres no housing crisis
2240413 we are only building 200 houses for rent in a year the council administration seems to think this is some sort of achievement but i think its a great under achievement
2240414 we should be under no illusions that this is going to be an easy fight but there is light at the end of the tunnel there are nearly 2000 houses sitting empty with a demolition order on them we have to put pressure on the council to lift that order
2240415 writing off this debt would release huge amounts of money to allow councils to invest in stock thereby solving virtually all our council housing investment problems in one act
2240416 stock transfers amount to coercion which is being pursued for purely ideological reasons and that a change of direction needs to take place
2240417 we believe there are no good financial reasons for denying debt write off and a change of direction could take place now with no need for legislation so what are we waiting for
2240418 this form of debt repayment is not in itself a cost to government in cash terms the original borrowing and the investment it funded was a cost to government but subsequent debt interest and repayments are transactions entirely within the public sector so there is no net effect
2240419 improvements to peoples homes and a change of landlord are two quite separate issues and should be treated as such housing stock transfers are an illogical approach to public housing provision and the approach must change

2240475 to hold any unitary authority elections on the existing county council boundaries is unacceptable the existing boundaries were designed for a different authority and a different local government structure making any such elections not fit for purpose for they would reduce the councillor basis from 331 to 82 over night thereby jeopardizing local democracy in cornwall

2240486 before last week chinese president hu jintao had never given a press conference either at home or abroad in which reporters were allowed to ask questions but in a rare sign of media nous by the chinese government mr hu has addressed the carefully selected question of a small group of foreign journalists in beijing one week from the start of one of the most politicised olympic games in recent years chinas human rights record in tibet and xinjiang as well as media restrictions imposed by beijing mean the country is under the global spotlight like never before mr hu told foreign journalists there were bound to be differences in the way those issues were viewed by china and by other countries
2240487 it is only inevitable that people from different countries and regions may not see eye to eye with one another on some different issues and i think in this context we should enter into consultations on an equal footing to narrow our differences and expand our common ground on the basis of mutual respect
2240488 the twenty or so foreign journalists at the press conference were treated to a bit of humour with mr hu saying that if pressed he would choose to represent his country in ping pong
2240489 i have a special interest for table tennis and swimming if i were to choose what kind of event i would like to take part in i would choose table tennis but i would like to let you know that since the line up of the chinese table tennis team is already finalised and made public it seems that my wish could not be granted
2240490 so the reporters were treated to the rarest of sights a chinese president smiling talking and cracking a joke with international media even if it was a pretty lame one and this week the chinese authorities appeared to allow some leeway after earlier turning its back on a promise to let foreign journalists covering the games complete access to the internet reporters at the olympic press centre were able to visit a few previously banned websites including those of amnesty international reporters without borders and deutsche welle but access to others remained blocked including any sites linked to the tibetan government in exile and the falungong movement mr hu insists journalists covering the games will be able to do their jobs
2240491 chinas door of opening up to the outside is always wide open no matter during the olympic games or after the olympic games we will as always welcome foreign reporters and journalists to come to this country to cover what is happening here
2240492 but of course they have to abide by the media laws of the chinese government as one german reporter found out when he tried to ask an un approved question of mr hu on human rights the chinese president paused briefly before declining to respond

2240504 its not about getting rid of the n a a c p or our members of congress its just wanting to be proud of our leaders
2240505 weve now got a black president clearly theres no longer any imbalance to be redressed
2240506 an alabama representative and one of the most talked about young talents on capitol hill
2240507 if obama is president it will no longer be tenable to go to the white community and say youve been victimized a nd i understand the poverty and the condition of black america and the 39 percent unemployment rate in some communities i understand that but if you go out to the country and say youve been victimized by the white community while barack obama and michelle and their kids are living in the white house you will be shut off from having any influence
2240508 even as we continue to defend affirmative action as a useful if limited tool to expand opportunity to underrepresented minorities we should consider spending a lot more of our political capital convincing america to make investments needed to ensure that all children perform at grade level and graduate from high school a goal that if met would do more than affirmative action to help those black and latino children who need it the most
2240509 we have to think about affirmative action and craft it in such a way where some of our children who are advantaged arent getting more favorable treatment than a poor white kid who has struggled more
2240510 obviously concerned about whether this is a retreat from a commitment to affirmative action in its classical sense
2240511 its a very interesting question but as a black person you should feel confident that he will focus on your injustices and know that all the other injustices in other communities affect you too
2240512 there have been wounds in all the communities not just in the black community there are plenty of wounds to go around

2240517 apparently mitt romney can switch names just as casually as he switches positions but whats wrongheaded is continuing a misguided war in iraq that has left america less safe its time to end the divisiveness and fear mongering that is at the heart of gov romneys campaign
2240518 barack bin laden oh im so sorry osama obama oh no not again barack dahmer ahhh i mean skeletor obama oh lord why does this keep happening by accident my terrorist i mean my opponent mr barack lucifer iii oh man this is so embarrassing what im trying to say is that barack obama loves evil and wants to kill your babies thank you and goodnight

2240796 this is something that i caught onto just before 2000 when there was so much search engine craze running around and started doing small just to test things at first but which i later expanded on after getting the hang of it
2240797 ive actually gotten over 87 million in advertising that using my secret i never had to pay for and the largest share of which was more recently in google pay per clicks as well as other forms of pad advertising at search engines all of which i got for free

2241286 for i have provided for myself a king among his sons
2241287 he was ruddy and fine in appearance with handsome features and the
2241288 these will be the ways of the king who will reign over you he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen and to run before his chariots and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots he will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers he will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his courtiers he will take one tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and his courtiers he will take your male and female slaves and the best of your cattle and donkeys and put them to his work he will take one tenth of your flocks and you shall be his slaves
2241289 a hapless person wincing in the strongest of grips of a huge python trying to force himself out but to no avail the reptile was forcing its own way in crushing his bones slowly but surely the man wearing a pitiful look full of compassion had nothing to offer in the name of resistance and resigned himself to the mercy of the giant creature

2241299 bloggers almost never advertise their sites they rely purely on word of mouth
2241300 google would be moronic to buy youtube because of its potentially huge copyright infringement exposure

2241322 if it is established seals are hunted in an inhuman way a ban on export and the marketing of seal products will be considered
2241323 i watched as conscious baby seals were hooked with metal spikes and dragged across the ice floes struggling
2241324 what bothers me the most is that somebody who perhaps doesnt understand the full picture would interfere with a way of life that is very respectful and is very true to who we are
2241325 we usually dont kill the babies we usually kill the adult harp seals
2241326 just during the week calculations done on the amount of fish eaten by the seal heard harp seal heard alone would fill 175 000 tractor trailers which on the highway would extend from new york to los angeles and back to texas
2241327 now if you can picture that thats the amount of fish eaten each year by the seals off our coast

2241347 the number of women aged between 15 and 50 is fixed
2241348 because the number of birth giving machines and devices is fixed all we can do is ask them to do their best per head although it may not be so appropriate to call them machines
2241349 having children or not having children is naturally a matter that women and households are free to decide themselves
2241350 there is no point in debating that there is no mistake that the military had set up and managed the brothels in that sense the government was responsible
2241351 thats why the government has apologised and because it felt that that was not enough from a moral standpoint began work to provide compensation and set up the fund
2241352 we are looking at the eurofighter along with other fighters
2241353 we are looking at all available data not just american data

2241355 you want one set of planes you own to talk to another set of planes you own

2241357 the christian faith has always believed that jesus was resurrected so there would be no bones
2241358 bring the story to the world and let the experts weigh in
2241359 its an old story thats been recycled the story first broke in 1996 by the bbc it burst in a couple of days
2241360 i just want everybody in this room and everybody in the world to know that i am so sorry
2241361 i just want everybody in this room and everybody in the world to know that i am so sorry
2241362 i left my kids by themselves a few times i thought maybe i can do that again i was just thinking about myself
2241363 as well as a person can whos under this kind of pressure
2241364 they wish me to express to the media how theyre sorry to all the canadians who have been affected by this matter theyve also been overwhelmed by people who have made contributions to people who made donations to the memorial
2241365 it is inconceivable and unacceptable that at this time monetary or economic reasons can justify committing a discriminatory act
2241366 but the judgment clearly says that racism is punishable and that nobody can hide behind the authority of his boss
2241367 sixteen thousand dollars thats a lot of money for what i did i didnt kill anyone
2241368 the damage that was done to him left us without being able to see him or hold him or touch him all because someone decided it would be a big rush to drive extremely fast down a street where there are pedestrians
2241369 those consequences need to be stiffer so there is no thought about taking someone elses life for granted
2241370 if some people choose to drive this way and wind up having to take a taxi it looks good on them
2241371 there is no difference between road racing and gangs having a gun fight on a busy street
2241372 we have to find ways of automatically removing these people from the road and grounding them right away
2241373 the whole purpose of the legislation should be that we send a strong signal to any driver in the province that street racing will not be tolerated and that there will be serious consequences
2241374 if you dont catch these people the toughest laws in the world arent going to be effective because they arent going to be implemented
2241375 theres a growing consensus that absolute targets are the better approach and that in fact there are ways to ensure that any burden is shared fairly and evenly and at the same time that there could be tremendous economic opportunity created
2241376 we were in a completely different political environment in terms of environmental awareness
2241377 the global warming imperative was not then what it has become now with the public in terms of public support and engagement and i believe that a liberal government today would be moving forward with absolute targets
2241378 just a small leak nothing too serious no risk of fire
2241379 the only people who came in here were pretty drunk saying a guy just got shot you know i mean its bar night
2241380 drunkenness happens every night so we see fights all the time but whistler isnt a bad town i love it
2241381 up here its always fun and frolic you never hear about crime or thievery but it didnt deter our big night out the apr s ski here is phenomenal
2241382 it made me go oh am i safe to walk back to the hotel it was okay but i was a little more my god because we hadnt been here for a few years
2241383 in the shoulder seasons and during bad weather especially the hotels start to offer deals and people can get rooms for under 100 a night and the better sea to sky highway brings people up here faster
2241384 a lot of these people only come up here to party you see them wandering around the village
2241385 whistler markets itself as a place to party and they get what theyre asking for
2241386 on the one hand they want you to go out and spend your money
2241387 but then they want you to go back to your hotel and be good and quiet
2241388 its too bad we want people to come up here and have a good time but we dont want any of that up here
2241389 a lot of us take two or three jobs in order to stay in whistler when you get a night off you end up at home with a six pack because youre so tired
2241390 there is a lot of community interest in the case and its better to have it resolved sooner rather than later
2241391 although i find he was not a leader in the offence the fact is he contributed to the offence

2241393 the people who were murdered on july 7 were not the victims of war the men who killed them were not soldiers
2241394 they were fantasists narcissists murderers and criminals and need to be responded to in that way
2241395 we knew this was going to happen a few years ago and we know how it will end
2241396 it will end with 5 billion out of the 6 with cellphones
2241397 a reasonable prediction is 4 billion in the next few years the current proposal is 4 billion by 2010 and then the final billion or so within a few years thereafter
2241398 eventually there will be more cellphone users than people who read and write i think if you get that right then everything else becomes obvious

2241426 come all of you young citizens theres news to you ill tell of how the coward liberals have come in here to dwell chorus which side are you on which side are you on which side are you on which side are you on liberals say in baghdad the future isnt bright no sense in even trying we must give up the fight my daddy was a liberal he faught in 41 but today its clear that liberals will surely cut and run now listen very carefully the time is short indeed you must either be a patriot or a stooge for harry reid so dont scab for the democrats and dont listen to their lies us poor folks havent got a chance unless we organize
2241427 i want a man with a 10 inch c k minimum
2241428 i want to meet a nice man who likes long walks holding hands on the beach while gazing into each others eyes
2241429 i try to see everything on the positive side i couldnt wait to spend time with my father i said well this could be my last time i didnt want to waste a golden opportunity
2241430 the only thing i asked the makers of the film is that they show the utmost respect to my father to the victims family to my family and to have those positive results like adoption works family values and love
2241431 the movie was truly heartfelt i dont cry often but i choked up
2241432 hes not just a pretty face hes very emotional in his role he really thinks about his role and really understands the two actors daniel henney and kim young chul were exceptional the other actors are very important too like the guy who plays so young kim in kwon
2241433 im still in awe this is really happening its a great privilege
2241434 i hope the movie does wonders not so much financially but transmitting the message about love forgive and forget and you dont need to be blood to be part of a family
2241435 growing up i was blessed in everything it was just like being part of a normal family when you love someone so much you dont see what their eyes skin color are like ill never get rid of my skin color my eyes but if someones really that keen about it it bothers them then i just dont associate with them those people are biased and they have their own prison they cant look outside the box
2241436 it was shocking yes he is a murderer but we have a story because of our situation i want to emphasize though that the movie is not about him its more about the relationship
2241437 the fact that i could see my dad that i could hold him knowing that my search was not in vain and if he died tomorrow if he were executed tomorrow i was very satisfied to know that i was able to hold my father not only for my sense of self gratification also for my father
2241438 but now he has hope if i were in that situation i would love to see my son for the last time and knowing that everythings ok
2241439 yes it was theatrical but looking at the bright side of things if it werent for the media i wouldnt have been able to hold my dad for the first time it would have been behind the glass
2241440 when you love someone so much it really doesnt matter
2241441 i went to see my father last monday but they wouldnt let me saying im not his real son

2241455 although its hard to say that the government sufficiently fulfilled its political responsibility to help the victims quickly return to japan and support them the government did not act illegally with regard to the forming and implementation of measures
2241456 regarding war displaced orphans who were forced to remain in china because of the governments policies before and after the war the government had a responsibility to take measures to help them quickly return to japan
2241457 the government had no direct experience of a situation involving a large number of long term returnees coming back to japan and it cannot be said that it failed to implement the necessary measures
2241458 japan is doing what the americans cant do you can trust japanese it would probably be no good to have blue eyes and blond hair
2241459 fortunately we have yellow faces we have never at all been involved in exploitation there in the middle east or been involved in fights or fired machine guns

2241461 id tried marijuana before and wanted to have another smoke again for the first time in a while
2241462 i couldnt refuse her because i thought no other facility would accept me
2241463 i got angry because she told me off for smoking pot
2241464 we are taking the incident seriously and will take strict measures against him
2241465 it is impossible to accept that rational doubts could arise over fact finding in a fixed ruling
2241466 i murdered maejima i want to live in that home with you and my daughter
2241467 its a waste but throwing them out is the only option
2241468 we got into trouble over a woman and i punched him
2241469 i saw kamike had sent an e mail to my girlfriend and i thought they were playing around on me i questioned him about it but he didnt admit to the affair so i got into a rage and bashed him
2241470 there were no facts in the entire story and no overall reason to believe it
2241471 im glad my argument was recognized and for that i appreciate the verdict
2241472 a nihon ethics of video association video was shown but it did not draw derision from students so the story was hyperbole
2241473 the defendant lacked awareness of his responsibility as president of a listed company
2241474 he made his company appear as if it had enjoyed rapid growth and misled investors his responsibility is grave he should be imprisoned instead of being handed a suspended sentence
2241475 i think totsuka wants everyone to value life to become strong and sturdy and to become leaders in society with kind hearts i sincerely hope that you always think of him especially as a friend
2241476 by looking at everyone who has helped out and cooperated weve learned the importance of being compassionate toward other people
2241477 we will never forget the friends weve studied with the seven older girls who died in the attack and totsuka

2241480 we offer our apologies and will return the money to customers who contact us
2241481 the ratio of sexless couples has been increasing in recent polls i think we have to make a connection between the increasing sexless rate and declining birthrates
2241482 the defendant ignored the law and endangered the lives of other people as he tried to put his selfish idea into practice
2241483 i think that the emperor and the empress are worried about a variety of issues involving the imperial family rather than reports in weekly magazines
2241484 wed like franchise stores to do business with us wed like to consider assistance for them including compensation for losses they suffer while they suspend their business
2241485 i was thirsty and went into the store to buy a drink
2241486 i noticed that the gate was down and applied the brakes but i failed to stop in time
2241487 inappropriate comments that inflict emotional distress on the bereaved families
2241488 we have been trying to confirm the aim of the search it is not related to flight operations or terrorism
2241489 it is our understanding that reports on the prime ministers remarks were not based on appropriate interpretation
2241490 we are considering an appropriate response including publishing rebuttals of media reports and commentaries overseas that are not based on facts or are based on misinterpretations

2241537 and the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door and his eyes have all the seeming of a demons that is dreaming and the lamp light oer him streaming throws his shadow on the floor and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor shall be lifted nevermore

2241556 die ist nicht in meiner liga sie w rde sich niemals f r so einen wie mich interessieren
2241557 ver nderungen kommen schrittweise fr her hast du keine m glichkeiten gesehen jetzt siehst du sie berall um dich herum doch du bist zu z gernd um sie zu ergreifen du wirst dir langsam immer mehr bewusst
2241558 wenn du merkst wie du z gerst sich die tat wenn du sie siehst kein z gern gaffen oder auf den perfekten moment warten action action action
2241559 pook ich kann das nicht wei t du ich bin unsicher ich habe nicht soviel selbstvertrauen
2241560 du verwechselt die ursache mit der wirkung die ursache f r deine z gernde art ist nicht deine unsicherheit du hast nicht bekommen was du wolltest was du begehrst das ist die ursache deiner z gernden art
2241561 du bist in einem teufelskreis gefangen du bist z gernd weil du es dir nicht gew hnt bist dass die dinge zu deinen gunsten laufen und sie werden auch nie zu deinen gunsten laufen weil du z gernd bleibst du siehst etwas was du willst beginnst zu z gern und die gelegenheit vergeht door of opportunity closes es passiert wieder und immer wieder mit jedem mal wo du dich f r unt tigkeit entscheidest gibst du dich ein bisschen mehr auf
2241562 wenn es eine wahl zwischen weniger schmerz und vermutlich mehr schmerz gibt so neigen wir uns f r weniger schmerz zu entscheiden in der pubert t einem m dchen an die w sche zu gehen und dabei zu scheitern dachtest du jeder w rde dich auslachen ob es nun wahr oder falsch war spielt keine rolle du dachtest dass es die wahrheit war und so enden w rde so verbliebst du im teufelskreis
2241563 in dem du erkennst dass die wahl der unt tigkeit immer schmerzvoller ist als das handeln die kindheit ist vorbei du bist der mann du musst approachen verpflichte dich zum handeln alle die jahre im z ger modus verschwendet haben wissen abweisung ist immer besser als bedauern immer
2241564 mein exfreund ist so ein wixxer jerk wieso behandeln mich die m nner so gemein
2241565 die wissen einfach nicht wie grossartig du bist du bist so sch n liebenswert bezaubernd und schillernd in jeder beziehung und war das nicht erkennt ist ein idiont
2241566 du bist so nett was f r ein guter freund du bist
2241567 lass mich dir noch mehr von meinen problemen mit m nnern erz hlen
2241568 ich dachte das durch die freundschaft die liebe gedeihen kann wie falsch ich damit lag
2241569 aber wieso pook wieso ist freundschaft hoffnungslos ich verliebe mich doch auch in meine weiblichen freunde passiert dann nicht das selbe mit ihnen
2241570 oh frau sag uns wieso willst du nicht mit deinen m nnlichen freunden anfangen
2241571 ja meine m nnlichen freunde verlieben sich andauern in mich
2241572 und sei ehrlich was machst du und deine m nnlichen freunde
2241573 oh naja wir h ngen etwas rum wir reden viel
2241574 es ist ein unterschied zwischen den geschlechtern junger mann was machst du mit deinen freunden
2241575 aber du und deine freunde sitzt ihr im kreis und unterhaltet euch ber eure gef hle und was so in eurem leben passiert
2241576 da hast du deine antwort m nner treffen sich nicht und reden dann nur wir machen etwas wenn wir mit unseren weiblichen freunden sind reden wir viel mehr da wir aber das reden ber gef hle und emotionen den romantische anl sse zuordnen werden wir verwirrt wenn wir mit unseren weiblichen freunden zusammen sind wir beginnen uns f r sie zu interessieren wenn wir mit ihnen zusammen sind
2241577 die frauen sind sich normalerweise nicht gew hnt zusammenzukommen und pure action zu erleben wenn sie also das mit ihren m nnlichen freunden unternehmen werden sie dann etwas verwirrt
2241578 vermeide die freundschafts schiene wenn du an einer frau interessiert bist nimm die romantische schiene den freund den sie in dir sieht der wirst du immer bleiben
2241579 was soll ich tun was soll ich anziehen habe ich genug geld wird es spass machen
2241580 haben wir uns falsch verstanden war es ein missverst ndnis
2241581 es sind alle frauen mutter natur pers nlich diese widerw rtige sphinx verschlingt alle herzen derer die ihr r tsel nicht l sen k nnen der mann im bild er konnte das r tsel l sen auf diese weise wurde er ber hmt als don juan
2241582 die antwort ist es gibt gar kein r tsel die frau ist eine sphinx ohne geheimnis es ist nur in unseren gedanken wo wir ihr geheimnisse podeste und g ttinengleicher status zuschreiben
2241583 also malen wir das bild das wir sehen m chten
2241584 ich werde geduldig sein und warte ab wie die w rfel fallen
2241585 wie kann geduld confidence sein ist confidence nicht mut ist es nicht action wie kann geduld mut und handeln sein
2241586 sehen wir uns doch einmal einen don juan und seine angewohnheiten an
2241587 h r mir zu oh don juan es gibt frauen in deiner gesellschaft und andere m nner baggern sie an was tust du dann
2241588 diese typen werden die frauen nehmen wie kannst du so gelassen sein
2241589 er ist so gelassen weil er weiss das er der grosse fang ist und dass er frauen easy kriegen kann er weiss er ist der prinz
2241590 ich h tte sie k ssen sollen ich habe einer philosophie vertraut und nicht mir selber ich sollte meiner inneren natur folgen und
2241591 warum das essen ist direkt vor ihm seine nase riecht es seine augen sehen es es sabbert
2241592 genau dasselbe mit den frauen was macht das kind als n chstes
2241593 all seine sinne sagen es ihm es weiss wann zu essen weil das essen sch n gekocht und zubereitet wurde und ihm danach pr sentiert wurde
2241594 genau das gleiche bei den frauen sie wurden f r diesen zweck ber jahrzehnte des alterns und des wachstums daf r vorbereitet sie tr umen es sie wollen es o mein gott und wie sie es wollen sie wurden durch deinen spass durch deine aufmerksam aufgew rmt durch ihr begehren und durch dein begehren sie pr sentieren sich meinst du sie zieht sich f r sich selber so an nein sie hat sich f r dich so angezogen frauen sind keine ornamente zum anhuldigen sie sind zum konsumieren du wei t es sie wissen es
2241595 die natur hat ein system errichtet keine philosophie der welt kann dir besser helfen jene philosophien die anscheinend funktionieren sind diejenigen die am besten zum system der natur passen du kannst entweder dich mit dem system treiben lassen und kriegen was du willst oder du kannst dich unter schmerzen dagegen str uben also h r auf dein bauchgef hl
2241596 es ist weil sie nicht wissen wie gut du bist
2241597 die einzige konstante bin ich was wenn es an etwas liegt was ich immer wieder mache
2241598 wieso benehme ich mich wie ein bettler ich bin smart h bsch habe eine zukunft und eigentlich m ssten die frauen mich beackern
2241599 super das heisst ich werde passiv h nge meinen alten gewohnheiten nach und tu nix um mich zu ver ndern es freut mich das zu h ren weil es heisst ich bin perfekt so wie ich in und brauche mich nicht zu ndern
2241600 dumme jugend wenn dich das leben nicht ver ndert dann lebst du das leben nicht
2241601 vor uns sind zwei jungs die and der schwelle zum leben sind beide haben den gleichen ursprung und trotzdem ihre wege sind unterschiedlich schauen wir uns den ersten an
2241602 ich habe sie in ehren gehalten ich habe ihr jeden tag blumen geschenkt ich habe lieder gesungen ich habe ihr immer gesagt ich liebte sie
2241603 schliesslich war er immer sich selber kommen wir zum zweiten jungen
2241604 dass sie in einer art stillstand stecken geblieben sind ich habe mich ver ndert sie merken dass aber sie sind genau die gleichen
2241605 der erste junge mann bewegt sich zur ck in die kindheit
2241606 der zweite wird immer besser der erste bleibt immer gleich oder wird noch schlechter
2241607 exakt es ist der unterschied zischen verfaulen und reifen sei die gute frucht sei der preis den es zu gewinnen gibt
2241608 sie ist meine freundin ich muss sie gl cklich machen
2241609 ich muss dies und das erledigen es w re wundervoll wenn du f r mich einkaufen w rdest
2241610 ahh indem ich ihre launen befriedigte liess ich meine eigenen beiseite ein diener du bist einen freund sie sieht denn
2241611 ich bin nicht bewandert genug um so eine frage zu beantworten fragen wir einen grossen philosophen
2241612 achtung sokrates du wurdest gerufen gib antwort auf die frage was respekt ist
2241613 das ist einfach pook wo verehrung ist da ist auch angst aber es ist nicht berall verehrung wo auch angst ist weil angst eine gr ssere ausdehnung hat als verehrung
2241614 oh weiser respekt ist die einsicht ber festgesetzte grenzen denn wie kann verehrung ohne eine spur von angst dass du weggehst entstehen die wahre leidenschaft mit frauen entsteht wenn der mann ohne m he und zweifel weggehen kann
2241615 beantworte mir dieses r tsel wieso machen dich m nner heiss die bereit sind wegzugehen
2241616 weiss dass den nicht jeder wenn ein mann der einfach so weggehen kann dann bedeutet das dass er sich das beste aussuchen kann und dass die frau problemlos ersetzt werden kann
2241617 der grossartige fang ist respekt sie dazu da das leben mit dir zu zelebrieren nicht um dich als tagl hner zu benutzen sei ein mann und der respekt wird von alleine wachsen
2241618 wenn sie dieses und jenes macht dann mach ich das
2241619 sind durch und durch sexuelle wesen sie reagieren nicht auf dein intellekt sie reagieren nicht auf dein genie das einzige worauf sie ansprechen ist sexualit t
2241620 die meisten m nner haben vor ihrer eigenen sexualit t angst schau dir die flachzangen an sie sind keine m nner sie sind zwitter menschenaffen
2241621 die frau hat nice guy zu ihrem palast der lust eingeladen
2241622 sie ist eine frau der junge mann nickt heftig sie sie ist es einfach schau dir den nice guy an
2241623 der grund er ist kein mann er ist nicht was er ist genug
2241624 da dieser nice guy saugt die frau mit seiner erb rmlichen freundschafts tour aus
2241625 egal fragen wir die frau hat herr nice guy einen penis
2241626 was der herr nice guy auf gar keinen fall der kann doch keinen penis haben
2241627 wie stellst du dir eine beziehung mit einer frau vor
2241628 willst du mit ihr den ganzen tag ber dna und biochemie reden
2241629 dann h r auf mit ihr ber dann und biochemie zu reden h r auf mit ihr ber streberzeugs zu reden du brauchst keinen neuen labor partner
2241630 dann nehme dich deiner sexualit t an sei ein mann rede wie ein mann rede wie ein mann benimm dich wie ein mann mach action dinge ber dinge zu reden die du liebst ist das eine aber die meisten typen reden ber dinge nur um zu reden
2241631 ich sexualisiere mich selber meine erscheinung und meine taten und die frauen werden automatisch folgen
2241632 wenn du diese verbindung mit jemandem hast das warme sichere und angenehme gef hl genau da dann kann es manchmal passieren
2241633 du sollst nie l nger als zwanzig minuten mit ihr telefonieren
2241634 die regeln und anleitungen sind st tzr der die uns aus dem nest helfen
2241635 wenn die anleitungen und regeln erfolgreich waren wieso sollte er sie aufgeben
2241636 weil er realisierte dass er nicht wegen den anleitungen und regeln erfolgreich wurde sondern nur wegen dem approachen und dem auf spass ausgerichteten mindset welches die anleitungen und regeln verlangten
2241637 ist ein schauspieler und sie schauten dem schauspieler zu wie er herkules henry v hamlet und vielen anderen helden wurde aber als person war der schauspieler ein totaler wussybag
2241638 allerdings der eine ist nat rlich selbstsicher der andere ist aus dem drehbuch
2241639 gar nichts aber ist ist ausschlaggebend den zweck von drehb chern und anleitungen zu verstehen
2241640 ich dachte das die frauen nett und charmant seien und nur die bad boys das problim dieses wissen zerst rt jedes ideal dass ich von den frauen hatte
2241641 aber ich bin nur ich selber ich werde mich nie f r jemanden ver ndern
2241642 du hast keine muskeln wie kommst du auf die idee dass du geile frauen kriegen kannst
2241643 du bist nicht schlau wie kommst du auf die idee dass du der fang deiner gruppe werden kannst
2241644 du hast kein hohes sal r wieso meinst du dass du eine geile braut verdient hast
2241645 du bist nicht so h bsch und gut aussehend wie die anderen typen dementsprechend hast du auch kein geiles chick verdient
2241646 und solange du denkst so lange wirst du frei bleiben
2241647 aber pook was bist du ein pers nlichkeitsentwicklungsseminar wo sind den die frauen hier enthalten
2241648 frauen kommen und gehen aber du bist immer bei dir der fokus muss bei dir liegen was erwartest du von einer frau was willst du an einem date unternehmen was f r eine art beziehung suchst du du schaffst dir die frau die du willst
2241649 aber pook was passiert wenn sie mein date nicht mag was ist wenn sie sich f r andere dinge interessiert als ich
2241650 dann ist sie nichts f r dich die frauen hassen es wenn du keine ideen f r ein date hast was vielen typen passiert weil sie wollen dass es dem girl gef llt ohne an sich selber zu denken du hast verschiede hobbys und vorlieben wenn sie deine ideen mag dann ist das gut wenn nicht dann such dir ein anderes es gibt milliarden da draussen
2241651 nur wenn der fokus auf der frau liegt wenn du das machst dann glaubst du dass die frauen die wahl treffen und nicht du abweisung gib es nicht du kannst nur herausfinden ob sie guten geschmack hat denn sie sucht einen mann der zu ihren interessen und vorlieben passt wenn sie dich aus welchen gr nden auch immer nicht mag lass sie und danke ihr daf r
2241652 was w rdest du bevorzugen eine frau die ihre eigenen interessen um deiner willen aufgibt nur damit sie einen freund hat oder eine frau die dich wegen dir mag
2241653 wegen unseren geschm ckern und unserer kompatibilit t gilt f r beide seiten
2241654 genau jetzt denk an deine nice guy tage zur ck diese schmerzhaften tage des unaufh rlichen zustimmens und konfrontationenmeidens was f r einen dienst hast du dir damit getan die kompatibilit t zu finden
2241655 schau in das tal schau wie der mann gefallen ist
2241656 alles w rde so viel einfacher sein wenn sie nicht weiblich w ren und logisch sinn machen w rden
2241657 was du bist immer noch single armer kerl aber auch du wirst dich eines tages weiterentwickeln und eine frau kriegen so wie wir
2241658 ich habe soeben eine neue freundin und du bist immer noch single hah
2241659 wir sind alle verheiratet oder haben freundinnen aber du armer bursche bist immer noch single
2241660 gib den frauen blumen schokolade gedichte liebeserkl rungen und deine ganze aufmerksamkeit mach ihnen versprechen gib ihnen deine exklusivit t deine zeit deine tr ume dein leben und bernimm ihre w nsche ihre pl ne ihre manipulationen und lass sie die zukunft gestalten
2241661 die meisten typen denken immer noch wie frauen sie glauben wenn sie mit vielen frauen im bett waren freundinnen haben oder verheiratet sind dass sie dann erfolgreich mit frauen sind
2241662 du meinst das der teufel in der not fliegen frisst du meinst dass die m nner die frauen ausw hlen und nicht umgekehrt
2241663 du bist nahe dran und das ist wahr aber die frauen daten aus allen m glichen gr nden sie heiraten aus allen m glichen gr nden und sie schlafen mit dir aus allen m glichen gr nden hinzuf gen zum vorher gesagten du willst eine frau finden die in dich interessiert ist
2241664 oh du armes ding du wirst auch eines tages ein girl kriegen so wie ich
2241665 jetzt spulen wir die zeit ein paar jahre nach vorne
2241666 der fehler ist dass die m nner ihren erfolg mit den frauen definieren die sie gehabt haben es w re besser sie w ren besorgt eine frau zu haben die ihn wirklich mag
2241667 ja aber wenn dus tust dann wirst du nicht dinge wie die folgenden sagen
2241668 sie sagte mir dass sie mich liebt und wir heirateten wieso will sie sich jetzt scheiden lassen
2241669 alle meine freunde dachten sie sei eine klammer wieso betr gt sie mich mit ihrem ex
2241670 ich machte ihre date ideen und sie denkt ich sei langweilig was soll das bedeuten
2241671 wenn du auf irgendetwas langfristiges aus bist dann musst du dir sicher sein dass sie dich mag nur weil sie mit dir dates hat ins bett geht und ja sogar dich heiratet heisst noch lange nicht dass sie dich mag
2241672 du bestimmst die dates zuerst sie wird mitmachen wenn sie dich mag nach ein paar monaten kannst du etwas aufweichen wenn sie dates absagt dich rotieren l sst oder unflexibel erscheint dann sind das warnzeichen dass sie dich nicht mag
2241673 ich verstehe aber was ist wenn du so schlecht in pickup bist das keine frau dich mag
2241674 dann hast du mehr zeit f r deine kumpels erfolg kann nicht das kriegen eines m dchens sein weil das umgekehrt heisst dass alleine zu sein ein versagen ist aber das wirkliche versagen ist es in einer ungl cklichen ehe oder in einer beziehung zu sein wo die frau kein wirkliches interesse an dir hat
2241675 richtig lass das eine frau zu kriegen ist erfolg mantra fallen und du wirst nie mehr verlassen
2241676 pest du kannst mich nicht f r immer gefangen halten
2241677 was bist du grausame stimme deine worte sind wie messer in meinem herz
2241678 dann bist du nicht mutig du f rchtest den scharfen ratschlag wie ein weicher wurm ich bin du dein inneres selbst deine eigene phantasie und wenn du m chtest seele indem du mich gefangen h ltst wird dein erfolg mit den frauen mit vermehrter frustration einher gehen
2241679 was du bist es also der diese leere in meinem k rper wie ein virus wachsen l sst
2241680 du feiges j mmerlich tr umendes st ck du wei t das du jetzt das kriegst was du so begehrt hattest frauen wieso bist du so ungl cklich
2241681 aber ich musste mich ndern weil ich keine frauen kriegte
2241682 und du hast versagt weil du mich gefangen h ltst du beschr nkst dich selber
2241683 ich verhalte mich nur in bereinstimmen zu dem was die frauen wollen
2241684 alles was die frauen wollen confidence humor spontanit t spass das sind alles qualit ten eines mannes der seine phantasie auslebt
2241685 tats chlich wie der himmel ber uns schauen die damen im womaniverse uns zu ja sie sehen immer was du tust sie schauen dein leben an und belohnen die m nner der welt mit dem femininen element
2241686 aber nicht alle m nner kriegen denselben typ dieses elements
2241687 neinnein einige kriegen unber hrtes material w hrend die idioten stinknormales erz abbekommen
2241688 was kannst du mir sonst noch ber dieses feminine element sagen
2241689 es wirkt sehr entspannend sehr dekorativ in sportwagen es explodiert und gefriert ohne grund und reagiert stark auf gold platin oder andere edelmetalle es verf rbt sich auch gr n wenn es neben hochwertigeren exemplaren platziert wird
2241690 was sagst du da pook das wir ein stein in ihrer welt und sie ein stein ein ballast in unserer welt sind
2241691 oh du junges dummchen diese gedanken sind so seicht und einf ltig denk nicht dran und lies den brief
2241692 selten normalerweise sprechen die frauen womanese so dass wir m nner sowieso nichts verstehen aber ich als pflichtbewusster pook habe den brief in m nnliche form bersetzt
2241693 gott sei dank jetzt versteh ich warum es so geschrieben ist
2241694 schau mich an ich bin gegenstand und mittelpunkt deiner welt meine launen sind dein gesetzt was du magst dein geschmack f r essen frauen und autos eingeschlossen wird von mir bestimmt ich alleine setzte den frame der welt in der du lebst
2241695 allerdings die gr sste berraschung die meiner transformation zum don juan war nicht dass die lteren frauen den unterschied bemerkten nein es war dass sie sagten es sei als ob ich erwachsen geworden w re
2241696 weil es die wahrheit war wieso l sst du andere menschen dein leben gestalten und formen dein leben dreht sich im kreis weil du dich nicht von deinen verlierer freunden oder bescheuerter unterhaltung losreissen kannst lies den brief weiter
2241697 wenn du eines tages die m glichkeit hast ins womaniverse einzutreten wirst du noch viel verbl ffter sein
2241698 ist es deine tr ume mit dem tag zu vereinigen es ist der einzige weg
2241699 das ist das sexieste was ich jemals geh rt habe
2241700 du bist echt bedenklich junge du bist ein elender zyniker ein missratener philosoph
2241701 schau als wir klein waren wollten wir nichts mehr als erwachsen werden jetzt wo wir erwachsen sind w nschen wir uns nichts mehr als wieder jung zu sein arme leute tauschen ihre wertvolle zeit und gesundheit mit geld nur um dieses wieder f r zeit und gesundheit auszugeben wir sind aus der welt der kinder gegangen
2241702 willst du mir damit sagen dass ich kindisch sein sollte
2241703 ja kleine kinder ohne den chemischen irrsinn den die pubert t mit uns angestellt hat haben die perfekte leichtigkeit und behandelnd die geschlechter angemessen kein kleiner junge wird sagen was immer du tun m chtest kleine jungs rennen herum sie sitzen nicht und reden die ganze nacht mit einem m dchen jungs haben ihre autos ihre wasserpistolen gefahren und begeisterungen jetzt vergleiche das verhalten dieser kleinen jungs zu dem verhalten von m nnern die wirklich erfolgreich mit frauen sind
2241704 sie sind identisch ich dachte immer die frauen seien unreif weil sie immer auf die so genannten jerks bad boys und sportskanonen standen ich bin jetzt der meinung dass sie schon auf eine art unreif sind aber daf r erhielten sie sich die freuden der kindheit w hrend ich diese erledigt habe
2241705 ich unterhalte mich mit ihr ber philosophie literatur die beschaffenheit des universums dna und biochemie ber
2241706 stop das halt ich nicht aus hier nimm einen schluck vom jungbrunnen
2241707 jetzt will ich dinge unternehmen nicht reden ich will herumrennen ich will spass haben
2241708 du bist mein leben ich liebe nichts so sehr wie dich ich werde alles f r dich tun
2241709 jeder mann hat eine passion f r verschieden dinge hier ist die passion f r autos wir sehen viele bilder mit verschiedenen autos die er mag auf der anderen wand ist die passion f r das essen wir sehen alle seine leibgerichte abgebildet auf dieser wand ist seine ambitionen die bilder zeigen alle dinge an die er noch machen will und jetzt schau dir die frauen wand an
2241710 ja die natur hat es so eingerichtet dass wir auf eine eheliche art lieben wenn nur ein bild auf der wand h ngt
2241711 das problem ist dass er mit ihr weder verheiratet noch verlobt ist er benimmt sich verheiratet dabei sind die zwei nur am daten oder nur freunde
2241712 ja wenn ein typ sich f rs daten entschliesst und nur ein chick aufs mal trifft dann erscheint nur ein bild auf seiner wand und dann ist er von der natur programmiert sich ihr gegen ber wie in der ehe zu verhalten er wird zum afc gegen ber dem girl obwohl er erst gerade angefangen hat sich mit ihr zu unterhalten
2241713 das heisst wenn ein mann sozial so ungeschickt ist dass er nur eine frau kennt als freund dann erscheint nur das bild dieser einen frau auf der wand und deswegen dem verliebt er sich in sie
2241714 exakt und wenn er nur eine f ckbuddy hat dann wir er sie schlussendlich daten und ausschliesslich mit ihr sein wollen und sich in einen totalen afc verwandeln
2241715 dann ist noch ein anderes babe auf der wand er kann sich nicht mehr verheiratet benehmen wenn mehr als eine frau auf der wand h ngt dadurch verhindert er zu einem latenten afc zu werden
2241716 wenn er aber sich eigentlich f r andere dinge interessiert m sste er dann nicht nur ein girl daten
2241717 nein entweder viele oder keine wenn du nur auf eine aus bist dann wirst du zum afc die meisten typen sind zu faul oder zu ngstlich um auf mehrere frauen aus zu sein so bleiben sie afc und sind f r immer im teufelskreis gefangen sind
2241718 pook ich verstehe der junge mann von dem du immer erz hlt hast das bist du

2241720 der reiz des lebens liegt im sch tteln der w rfel
2241721 monsieur pook wie viel m chten sie f r den wurf setzen
2241722 aber wenn du das tust verlierst du all deinen besitz dein soziales umfeld und deine zeit sozusagen dein ganzes leben bist du sicher das alles auf deine tr ume dein talent und deine ausdauer zu verwetten
2241723 du kannst die schlaueste person der welt sein der talentierteste der unnachgiebigste aber du wirst in der welt der frauen nie gewinnen wenn du dich nicht der herrlichkeit des risikos annimmst
2241724 aber pook ich habe angst vor risiken was passiert wenn ich verliere
2241725 du kannst nicht verlieren jeder will ber dein leben bestimmen um es zu seinen gunsten zu gestalten von den politikern bis zu deinen freunden alles ist gut solange du so bleibst wie du bist aber wehe wenn du versuchst aus deiner gussform auszubrechen dann wird jeder und ich meine wirklich jeder versuchen dich davon abzuhalten
2241726 wie auch dem schlachtfeld wo der tapfere krieger auch ehrenwert ist wenn er in einer ruhmreichen schlacht verliert es ist nicht der sieg der den mann ausmacht es ist der kampf es gibt menschen sei es wegen dem schicksal oder einfach nur wegen dem pech jeden tag scheisse fressen m ssen und sie gewinnen jedes mal wenn sie sich dagegen wehren
2241727 riskieren ist k mpfen das ganze wissen die einblicke sind lediglich schwert schild r stung mit dem wir k mpfen und jene die unbewaffnet k mpfen sind w rdiger als jene die mit den besten waffen beschm ckt nur herum sitzen
2241728 ja deshalb spricht man im englischen paradies genauso aus wie ein paar w rfel setze alles was du hast denn wenn du dein talent und deine tr ume begr bst um darauf zu sitzen wirst du den zorn des himmels auf dich ziehen unw rdiger diener werden sie dich schreien
2241729 aber was tun wenn die situation unm glich erscheint was wenn alle chancen gegen dich stehen was passiert dann

2241915 to learn that there are people who love them dearly but simply have not yet learned how to express or show their feelings
2241916 to learn that two people can look at the same thing and see it differently
2241917 to learn that it is not enough that they forgive one another but they must also forgive themselves
2241918 is there anything else you would like your children to know
2241919 hello world well here we are another day goal setting
2241920 this morning when i opened my calendar everything looked different
2241921 today i am one step closer to experiencing the wild success that ive dreamed about
2241922 im not a salesperson im a lawyer accountant cabinet maker dress designer hr advisor etc i wasnt trained to sell and i dont want to sell damn it
2241923 i thought if i joined a consulting company the clients would be provided and id be able to do what i love to do deliver services
2241924 i never expected that working inside this corporation at this level that id be spending a great deal of my time persuading educating convincing others of what i know is the right strategy to take
2241925 i have no idea how to build my own practice in this particular area im currently focused on learning and doing the work given to me but i know partnership includes getting known in this area and that doesnt just happen
2241926 it just planted something in me like a little seed and i thought this is big i cant just walk from this
2241927 all of a sudden i didnt feel so isolated anymore because this wasnt just my unique experience
2241928 theres this allusion out there that the teachers have these great jobs but more than half of the faculty and support staff in the college system do not
2241929 the last day of school last semester was the saddest day that i remember in the college system
2241930 i saw two grown men in tears because they were promised a sessional posting and then at the last minute had it taken away from them
2241931 they cant think of us as human beings or they wouldnt be able to treat us like this
2241932 they wouldnt be able to sleep at night unless they depersonalized us i see this as white collar slavery where the colleges gain money and control
2241933 it needs attention from the provincial government and weve lobbied local mpps to do something about it
2241934 we wont rest until this act is amended and were way beyond the tipping point weve mobilized resources that are quite phenomenal across the province
2241935 perhaps it made sense at that point that they didnt have the right to bargain collectively but not now when there are 17000 part time workers and only 15000 f t workers not now when workers at colleges have to have another part time job in order to survive not now when a part time worker is often going to be a new canadian
2241936 the colleges have fastened onto the loophole and have used it as a source of cheap labour
2241937 everyday they drive truckloads of thousands and thousands of part time workers through that loophole onto college campuses throughout ontario
2241938 when youre rubbing shoulders with someone whos teaching the same things you are and getting paid a fraction of the amount it makes you feel bad
2241939 we think that the rampant use of part timers in the colleges is really hurting the quality of education the students receive
2241940 whether they colleges recognize that we have a right to do so or not were going to call them to the table and say hey bargain with us now because we represent 17000 of your workers
2241941 i think i understand some of the discussion that has gone on in terms of hiring so many part timers i think people who feel they are being exploited are entitled to
2241942 students have the right to have knowledge transferred to them from someone who is knowledgeable and if they arent getting it from a part timer then i think that that is then an issue
2241943 mhmm wednesday im going to matagalpa con un equipo de misioneros
2241944 part timers now form a majority of the workers in the community colleges in ontario
2241945 were offering the core programs the core courses the core support administrative work and we can speak as authoritatively as anyone else as far as quality of education so our numbers require that the government pay attention to us
2241946 we were going to two government events a week to talk to government officials and we created quite a stir the blackberries were buzzing when we showed up it was wild
2241947 i saw people search for two hours just to find a textbook to figure out how to teach the course
2241948 my health and wellness class swelled to 60 this semester and its a good thing im an experienced educator because none of my evaluations fit i had to redo my course outline my assignments and try to make an experiential course work for 60 people with no increase in pay
2241949 i think they should be getting paid the same hourly rate and they should have the tools and the space needed to do their jobs properly because it affects the way they interact with students
2241950 this is my moment to shine theres nothing they can ask me that i dont already know
2241951 los medios electr nicos no jerarquizan la informaci n por su nivel de importancia sino por el impacto que pueda generar en la audiencia

2241953 la vida no es sino una continua sucesi n de oportunidades para sobrevivir
2241954 if too many black males are allowed access to higher college education and are allowed to grow and succeed on equal footing with the white male then this would also threaten the white neo colonial initiative worldwide because collectively the black males would then have enough knowledge and education concerning their own black histories economics and business to understand the true direction in which they must go and how to proceed in doing so
2241955 already 33 2 of 18 to 24 year old americans post photos to web sites via mobile phones according to mobile consultancy m metrics by contrast only 18 7 of these young adults play downloadable mobile games one of the most successful forms of mobile content to date and a 600 million market in the u s last year according to consultancy idc this suggests to me theres absolutely interest in participating in mobile social networks says mark donovan an analyst at m metrics

2241967 evergreen envisions a sustainable society where individuals live in harmony with and contribute meaningfully to their local environment
2241968 we realize the concept of taking an old abandoned factory and turning it into the north americas greenest project is certainly something to raise eyebrows in the development community
2241969 this is not just one new building utilizing green technologies or just one restored heritage building but a whole village of them that beautify the city entice tourists and teach visitors how to better protect the environment
2241970 im a big believer that the more we become disconnected from nature the more we become disconnected from each other and eventually our lives become as artificial as our urban environment

2242000 things of this world are in so constant a flux that nothing remains long in the same state thus people riches trade power change their stations flourishing might cities come to ruin and prove in times neglected deoslated corners whilst other unfrequented palces grow into populous countries filled with wealth and inhabitants but things not always changing equally and private interest often keeping up customs and privileges when the reasons of them are ceased it often comes to pass that in governments where part of the legislative consists of representatives chosen by the people that in tract of time this representation becomes very unequal and disproportionate to the reasons it was first established upon to what gross absurdities the following of custom when reason has left it may lead we may be satisfied when we see the bare name of a town of which there remains not so much as the ruins where scarce so much housing as a sheepcote or more inhabitants than a shephered is to be found sends as many representatives to the grand assembly of law makers as a whole country numerous in people and powerful in riches

2242007 bisa kita bisa melihat dari budaya barat orang indonesia bisa terpengaruh dengan budaya tersebut
2242008 sayangi budaya sendiri jangan kalau ada yang lebih bagus dari luar langsung diambil tanpa dipilih pilih kalau mau mengikuti ikuti yang positifnya
2242009 my concern about any quibbling in relation to this matter is known to the japanese government and im sure in one way or another it will be mentioned tomorrow
2242010 it was an appalling episode in a tragic period in the history of the world and australian women suffered as a consequence although the nationals of other countries suffered in much greater number
2242011 there can be no quibbling about what happened and there can be no
2242012 any suggestion that there was not coercion is completely repudiated by me and its been completely repudiated by other allied countries
2242013 justice has never been done by the japanese government and this could all be part of that security relationship
2242014 its a very good time to raise it and wouldnt we admire mr howard if he
2242015 they think we are just like toilet paper that they can throw away after being used
2242016 the fact is there is no evidence to prove there was coercion
2242017 its along the same lines of denying the holocaust it was a war crime against humanity
2242018 we have heard how quick western politicians are to condemn holocaust deniers which is good because that has to be done
2242019 but on the other hand western politicians are so silent when they encounter these denials from japanese right wing politicians who say the rape of nanking was justified and these comfort women these sexual slaves were willing victims
2242020 suddenly to have abe deny the fact that women were coerced into sexual slavery is both very regrettable and very enraging
2242021 you dont try and buy businesses worth 83 million for 80 million you leave yourself an enormous margin when you build a bridge you insist it can carry 30 000 pounds but you only drive 10 000 pound trucks across it and the same principle works in investing

2242026 susahnya terasa banget waktu ngerjain skripsi dosenlah yang jadi penghambat apalagi kalau banyak revisi
2242027 kebanyakan salah mahasiswa ada pada selain itu banyak terdapat kesalahan pada pemilihan kata yang tidak pas kalimat aktif pasif terkadang tidak diperhatikan oleh mahasiswa tidak ada hubungan antara kalimat satu dengan yang lain pun ada dalam skripsi mahasiswa
2242028 banyak mahasiswa yang copy paste dari sumber tanpa dibaca lagi dan dimengerti kalimatnya semua aspek grammar juga harus dimengerti
2242029 kalau mahasiswa nya on off lalu tiba tiba datang dan minta dikoreksi secepatnya saya paling malas kecuali mahasiswa nya sudah self correction dan hanya memperbaiki sedikit kesalahan

2242037 the minister counsellor solemnly sat down and read us the most bizarre and extraordinary letter i have ever seen in my life
2242038 it the letter goes on and on and is really quite odd
2242039 its going to have the very opposite effect of what they intended its drawn attention to the book
2242040 my publisher in japan must be absolutely rubbing his hands with joy at the idea of increased sales
2242041 they the letters didnt specify anything in particular they were complaining about
2242042 they were just a complete widespread rave it was most unprofessional
2242043 its the emperor household agency that should be apologising to princess masako for destroying her health
2242044 disrespectful descriptions distortions of facts and judgemental assertions with audacious conjectures and coarse logic
2242045 linking appearance and qualifications of english educators is questionable it encourages discrimination on appearance and race
2242046 was aware that it was an old discriminatory idea but couldnt resist customers needs
2242047 i regard this as an attempt by the japanese government to suppress and censor my book and i think it is absolutely outrageous
2242048 disrespectful descriptions distortion of facts and judgmental assertions pertaining to the birth of her imperial highness princess aiko and the physical conditions of her imperial highness the crown princess masako
2242049 they the letters really didnt specify anything in particular they were complaining about
2242050 they were just a complete widespread rave it was most unprofessional
2242051 the japanese public has been kept in the dark for all these years about what has been going on behind the moat and i have written this book that is highly critical of the imperial household agency
2242052 the bureaucrats are just scrambling to protect themselves from criticism
2242053 there is nothing to apologize for in fact there is only one person in this saga that deserves an apology and thats princess masako i think the kunaicho imperial household agency should apologize to her for bullying her into a state of nervous breakdown
2242054 mr natsus appearance is utterly unremarkable how does he do it
2242055 ive had angry husbands burst in on me at home
2242056 the personal growth that results from getting older and raising children manifests itself in considerateness toward other people and this is apparent in their bed play
2242057 are starved for conversation i mean really if a couple has been together for a few years what do they have left to talk about and so they talk about their kids about their husbands then when theyre all talked out its time to help them forget their husbands
2242058 i dozed off on the train and found my hand on the womans leg when i woke up
2242059 instead of laying blame the airlines are talking with the manufacturer about the matter
2242060 apparently the pilot was very calm and did just as he was trained
2242061 my research shows that if you dont have sex for a month you probably wont for a year this is very bad news for the countrys birthrate and something the government needs to look into urgently
2242062 this is very bad news for the countrys birth rate and something the government needs to look into urgently
2242063 my research shows that if you dont have sex for a month you probably wont for a year
2242064 has not come across anything recorded in the materials it has found that directly shows so called coercion on the part of the military or constituted authorities
2242065 this was a very unpleasant surprise if the report is true
2242066 some are still alive and for them it is very painful because old wounds can still be painful especially when things like this are said
2242067 ser que devia estar a marcar o meu advers rio em cima
2242068 a rollercoaster taxi ride from microbes to man via african eve homo erectus and a lot of monkeying about
2242069 its the journey of a single hedonist who came to south africa to surf who was just out there for himself and is now out there for his kids with a bit of a twist because thats my primary career and i have an adopted son that im bringing up myself it sounds cheesy and i almost dont want you to print it but its my journey to knowing myself and i hope becoming a really good human being
2242070 i came out to work at the red cross hospital doing histology which is next to microbiology the study of lumps and bumps its looking at the very small things inside them and is ultrastructural if i was still a stand up comedian id say that all i ever used it for was to try and find my penis now id just say that yes i used to be a bit of a nerd
2242071 or you could saw that i saw the hospital strikes coming i could see into the feature and knew that theatre was a more stable career option its partly that you know and partly that i didnt like the idea of working a day job id never be satisfied doing the same thing all day every day but i had no idea that comedy was what i was going to do until it started happening i was going out there with bands and i saw that i could entertain purely by speaking i didnt need to be up there playing with my balls anymore
2242072 we all talked about one day having our own solo show it was the challenge to do something entirely by yourself
2242073 it can be terrifying just telling jokes but id never actually had a script id have the starts and the finish of the jokes what i called my idiot proof notes jotted down on scraps of paper and i had my ideas books thoughts that id sketched every year and notes from the time i used to carry a dictaphone around when i looked back i saw that i had a couple of ideas from years back that were more existential ideas they werent really comedy they were about life and the universe and how did we get here you know that we could be the only planet that has living creatures on it its such a unique process that has to occur such a tiny chance i wrote about that and i realised that that would be the star of the show why are we here became the formula for working it out
2242074 its bizarre i didnt ever set out to do this im a biologist who became a street performer who became a comedian who became an actor
2242075 missing links is a meaningful kind of show its funny and with a bit of pathos at the end its family friendly with no swearing which i guess is a change from me all those years ago making jokes about drugs at rock n roll festivals in parts it has a message and some reviewers have called it intellectually challenging it comes form what its about i talk about being a hands on dad i talk about when my wife nearly bled to death when we had our baby i talk about my adopted boy im a big joker but when i talk from the heart there are times ive almost made myself cry on stage because these things are real some people have said its profound and there have been some amazing comments from the public some of them were from my friends too so im not too sure its a show i think that has some parts that make you laugh and some parts that make you cry
2242076 thats just be bloody quick and be bloody good and dont hang around theres no indulgence asked of them with stand up too its a laugh a minute comedy fans expect that and there no indulgence asked of them you can talk more in a theatre people will indulge that in stand up i was always very nervous about not being funny every single minute or before that doing street shows for people who havent even paid to see you the new show goes into some heavy stuff it really explores what you can do in a theatre that you cant do in a comedy club
2242077 there is a connection between all of us that i think people have forgotten about because weve become so urbanised and theres a massive amount of disinformation out there genetically humans are so similar that its almost like theres no such thing as race biologically speaking the differences are so small we need to remember to celebrate those differences but to remember that we all come from one source and get on and respect one another weve got plans to try and take the show to rural schools and id love to translate it into xhosa youve got that and then youve got things like these two guys at the klein karoo nasionale kunstefees coming up to me and they were easily in their 70s and saying we really loved the sentiment in your show its a funny taxi ride of a show thats about being a caring and contributing part of society

2242092 what has occurred i foretold long ago it fell from my lips i predicted it then suddenly i acted it was done what god purposes will happen if he tells us something anything is to occur it will occur isaiah 46 9 10 states remember the former things of old for i am god and there is none else i am god and there is none like me declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times the things that are not yet done saying my counsel shall stand and i will do all my pleasure strong words and all skeptics should heed them well but god goes further not only are men powerless to foretell and fulfill prophecy god is also capable of stopping and overthrowing the purposes of governments and nations the eternal wrecks the purposes of pagans he brings to nothing what the nations plan but the eternals purpose stands for ever and what he plans will last from age to age jehovah god looks from heaven beholding all mankind from where he sits he scans all who inhabit the world he who alone made their minds he notes all they do

2242101 the amount of deviant behavior in american society has increased beyond the levels the community can afford to recognize and that accordingly we have been redefining deviancy so as to except much conduct previously stigmatized and also quietly raising the normal level in categories where behavior is now abnormal by any earlier standard

2242134 that the imperial household agency pretends she suffers from has
2242135 i think that they were coerced to engage in prostitution that means they were raped by japanese military at that point in time
2242136 i think there is a sensitivity in the united states on this particular issue and i think the japanese needed to be aware of that and i think they are
2242137 i think the prime minister is going to have a very good visit in the united states and i would hope this sort of thing would not detract from it
2242138 there is no evidence to back up that there was coercion as defined initially
2242139 it was not as though military police broke into peoples homes and took them away like kidnappers

2242154 are we as a facilitators of a possible community time rich or time poor
2242155 if the answer is time rich then funding may be a curse if time poor it could be a cure but like many things needed still best in moderation
2242156 if someone wants to invest in a community then a long term financial vehicle would be better than an annual budget more like an annuity that would provide modest funds for say 10 15 years do any cops live longer than this naturally and then the original capital is returned to the funder
2242157 budgeting for the management and coaching of potential users in the design process
2242158 even cops with no formal funding are in fact funded insofar as the tools and the time and energy members put into the community or at least a portion of those things are themselves funded
2242159 the challenge and it is a big one is to find strategic ways to collectively direct the funding and the energy such that at a given historical point in the life of a cop the exchanges around activities dialogues information knowledge etc that need the greatest support get such support
2242160 how to sustain life and the answer is not always the same for different cops or even for the same cop at a different point in time
2242161 some sort of spectrum from a pure cop to a task force etc and some type of evolution flow between the two
2242162 not everything deserves to be should be continued forever thinking of sustainability only in financial terms can get one in trouble
2242163 it can wander and roam but it does have some parameters defined by the host does that somehow not make it a cop

2242171 the gift of the two cutters was one of almost 900 grants congress has made to faith based organizations since 1987 through the use of provisions called earmarks that are tucked into bills to bypass normal government review and bidding procedures

2242186 i usually say that if a community cant get their act together and organize themselves to keep going then its a dud in the first place usually there needs to be a core of at least 3 4 people who just keep digging away at it and continue to exchange others will watch and join the argument that this all costs i feel is totally wrong i have been highly active in communities that simply got themselves a yahoo group and thats that to be blunt the biggest problem for continued autonomous functioning after the initial funding ceases is the initial funding if i were a funding agency trying to support the emergence of cops i would only fund something that is already working on a shoestring but more often than not funding agencies kind of initiate cops with the hope that they will continue wrong what funding agencies initiate is usually what is on their own agenda
2242187 ah heres a variant guys in a funding agency may feel they need to get something going for themselves fine then lets not let them project this outside and launch a cop to take care of that they should be organizing their own little informal cop among themselves to take care of the issue and that may eventually become more formalized

2242460 aku menghadapi kesulitan yang amat sangat ketika pergi untuk melaksanakan shalat subuh dan isya di masjid aku merasa tidak akan kembali dalam keadaan hidup setelah shalat kami merasa tidak aman sama sekali

2242463 beberapa waktu yang lalu kami tidak merasakan ketenangan ketika tidur dan istirahat dikarenakan percobaan senjata oleh para pedagang senapan dan pistol serta penjajahan dagangan mereka kepada para pengunjung pasar
2242464 tidak mungkin hidup di tengah letusan senapan dan di antara pedagang senjata serta obat obat terlarang dan kami tidak memungkinkan untuk melarang mereka karena hanya berbicara kepada mereka pun nyawa menjadi taruhannya
2242465 akan tetapi saat ini keadaan telah berubah berbalik 360 drajat anda tidak melihat lagi orang menenteng di jalanan gaza bahkan di pasar mobil sekalipun dan kami tidak lagi mendengar letusan letusan senjata api sehingga memungkinkan bagi anak anak kami untuk keluar dari rumah sejak al qasam menguasai gaza juga mereka bisa menikmati transportasi air serta pergi ke sekolah tanpa dibayangi kekhawatiran atas nyawa mereka

2242480 given that care country offices operate under very tight resource constraints a community can be successful only if it can demonstrate that it can add immediate value to areas of strategic importance to care moreover care does not have the resources for dedicated facilitation of communities therefore cops at care need to consist of self motivated individuals who are passionate about their area of expertise and are committed to the growth of knowledge in strategic areas of interest to care thus the formation of communities at care is an active choice by members from different country offices who want to make the time to engage with each other because they perceive the value of sharing knowledge for themselves and for the organization

2242482 perpecahan dan ikhtilaf yang menyebabkan tidak berkumpul dan bersatu terhadap mereka yang berbeda mengakibatkan sebagian dari mereka membenci dan memusuhi yang lain serta mencintai dan berloyalitas kepada yang lain sampai mengakibatkan timbulnya celaan hinaan cacian terhadap yang lain juga sampai menimbulkan pertumpahan darah baik dengan tangan maupun senjata serta menyebabkan pemutusan hubungan dan pemboikotan sehingga sebagian dari mereka tidak shalat di belakang sebagian yang lain ini semua adalah termasuk perkara paling besar yang diharamkan allah dan rasul nya
2242483 berkumpul dan bersatu adalah salah satu perkara paling besar yang diwajibkan allah dan rasul nya
2242484 bagaimana boleh dalam umat muhammad shalallahualaihi wasalam ini ada perselisihan dan perpecahan sehingga seseorang berloyalitas pada sebuah thaifah dan menyakiti thaifah yang lain dengan prasangka dan hawa nafsu tanpa menggunakan hujjah dari allah allah telah berlepas terhadap nabi nya dalam masalah seperti ini ini adalah perbuatan ahlu bidah seperti khawarij yang memisahkan diri dari jamaah muslimin dan menghalalkan darah mereka yang menyelisihinya adapun ahlu sunnah wal jamaah mereka yang tetap berpegang teguh dengan tali allah
2242485 ulama dari para sahabat tabiin dan setelah mereka jika berselisih dalam permasalahan mereka mengikuti perintah allah
2242486 aisyah ummul mukminin radhiallahuanha telah menyelisishi ibnu abbas dan para sahabat lain yang berpendapat bahwa muhammad shallahualaihi wasalam telah melihat rabb nya aisyah berkata
2242487 barang siapa mengira bahwa muhammad telah melihat rabb nya maka telah berdusta besar kepada allah taala
2242488 para sahabat telah bersepakat dalam masalah yang mereka selisihkan untuk mengakui tiap tiap kelompok dalam mengamalkan hasil ijtihadnya masing masing lihat risalah ulfah hal 79
2242489 alhamdulillah dalam masalah masalah ijtihad barang siapa mengamalkan pendapat ulama tidak boleh diingkari atau dijauhi dan barang siapa mengambil salah satu dari dua pendapat juga tidak boleh dingkari jika dalam sebuah masalah ada dua pendapat apabila seseorang mengetahui ada salah satu dari dua pendapat yang lebih rajih maka hendaklah ia mengamalkannya jika tidak maka dibolehkan dia bertaklid terhadap beberapa ulama yang bisa dijadikan rujukan untuk menjelaskan pendapat yang lebih rajih diantara dua pendapat wallahualam
2242490 saya tidak mengikuti millah ali ataupun utsman akan tetapi saya mengikuti millah rasulullah shalallahualaihi wasalam

2242581 i grew up with a jazz musician father and with him it was kind of like food air water and music were all one there wasnt a day in our lives when there wasnt music on the stereo or being played live when i was younger i thought id play the drums then i got side tracked for a while acting but i kept playing the music there came the day i wanted to perform again and just sitting behind the drum set was not enough and i started singing
2242582 i love the city but i felt i had been everywhere i wanted to and you know that when new york starts feeling like a small village then youve done whatever it is that youre meant to there i wanted to get to a town that wasnt so intense my mom is from sweden so there are some connections and i saw a place where a lot of cool music was being made with really cool musicians and some interesting labels my plan was to go there get on the road and play and get my chops up and then maybe try for something international the way things went it was the best plan i couldve made and later it was fun going back to new york more fun than i thought it would be
2242583 youve got to make it right and eventually i found a smaller label in stockholm that i liked i liked that way they did things and the artists they had so i took the plunge
2242584 but im thankful the knives were put back into their case i was expecting a much tougher time than i got what was really important to me was to make an album that i could be proud of and stand behind the smaller label was the place to do it and by the end of the record i was exactly 100 percent involved even down to the video which i was allowed to be in control of if i would have chosen to become a jazz musician it would have been tougher i really tried to do my own thing and it seems that it worked of course a song like save tonight helped this it helps to have that hit on the radio

2242588 my guitar deputy matthias whos been with me for years and my percussion player sebastian whos been mostly based in brazil its a three piece so its both exciting and budget friendly so we can get down there its exciting because its like returning to where the songs come from i write most of my tunes just me and the guitar so were hoping its a nice way to get an appetiser and then maybe one day we can get down there with the whole band
2242589 my dad always used to say you cant do anything without rhythm and this guy hes not just any percussionist hes a real player ive done things with just guitar and a shaker or a beat along with that and thats what you want ive found that the bass is nice to have but once you get into that electric bass sound you start to leave the unplugged world i want to keep these songs intimate and real close

2242760 i am a mom of two and have been scrapbooking for about ten years as i was scrapbooking my childrens scrapbooks i had a strong desire to make sure that my kids knew and understood how god had moved and shaped their lives even when they were little and did not know it i also wanted the books to be a witness of gods love for them and others in the years to come i started looking for products that could express some of my thoughts there was very little avaliable as i prayed about it and looked further into it i was given the idea to print some scripture stickers after much research to produce a quality product pure d scripture was created i know the best thing i can do for anyone is expose them to gods word i wanted beautiful stickers that would go with lots of things so the stickers are on a clear paper and written in black the backgroud of whatever paper you are working with shows making them match any project you are working on it is on my heart that our scrapbooks will become a witness of our lord jesus christ and all he does for us pointing us and future generation towards him ever time we look at our pictures gods word is always a blessing

2242814 while increasingly difficult to control government officials still attempt to block certain websites and web activity and monitor websites citizens of arab countries are aware of the watchful eye of government on the internet and would therefore be more reluctant to engage in the open and frank exchanges of views that cops engender
2242815 statistics show that arab states are low in use of the internet compared to other regions of the world
2242816 the lack of arabic content is partly the result of the difficulties of working with html in arabic this has created a self perpetuating problem because online communities do not have the specialized scientific or educational materials they need to engage in electronic knowledge exchange in arabic they will therefore be more likely to use english or french thus marginalizing some segments of society and restricting involvement to the more educated classes who are comfortable working in a foreign language

2242843 i know i know i was thinking of joan its been longer than a week since she disappeared no one but you and me seems to even have noticed that ugly house what if for some reason unknown to you and me she got inside it and got trapped there what if she fell down a flight of stairs and broke a leg or got knocked unconscious
2242844 what would joan be doing in that old house but you know young people they like to get into trouble
2242845 she wouldnt go inside that house shed be too scared especially if she was alone
2242846 the sheriff questioned all her friends she hasnt been seen by anybody

2242857 its probably just nerves youre on edge i feel that way too but now i dont hear anything
2242858 oh boy i hope we dont run into something unpleasant like a ghost or a monster
2242859 i suspect it was the occupant of the bed poor child it had to be a child its so small
2242860 it was a girl something was chasing her she ran into the closet to hide whatever it was the devil or maybe some demon found her
2242861 theres only one place left to search the cellar whatever is in this old tomb of a house must be in there you know how these old houses are made usually the stairs to the cellar is under the kitchen floor my folks used to send me down into our cellar for potatoes and turnips i used a lantern just like the ones were using because it was so dark down there
2242862 i see you are stubborn and need to be convinced
2242863 but youre not the devil i felt your presence ever since we came into this old house

2242973 you got it all wrong my heart is fine i only have a little problem with my hearing
2242974 i said peacemaker and not pacemaker sir anyway how are your efforts in behalf of peace
2242975 oh i see well theres a lot of work to do did you know that there are right now twenty seven conflicts around the world twenty seven grim reminders of mans stupidity of mans incredible race to self destruction
2242976 i didnt realize that there were so many i can think of no more than three or four especially those that have benefited from your services like somalia middle east cuba haiti south africa
2242977 for a member of the press you dont seem to be well informed maybe you should spend more time in the news room
2242978 what is the truth behind the claim that in the past you have taken matters into your own hands and proceeded to act without the knowledge and support of either the president or the state department
2242979 an exaggeration of course but sometimes you gotta do things at the spur of the moment and you cant afford to waste time in bureaucratic procedures you see the state department is a paper processing property wars and conflicts have to wait for the proper paperwork to be completed and it isnt a matter of covering their collective asses its simply that the paperwork is in itself an end if some nation were to declare war on the united states they would more likely give up after a while because of all the corresponding forms theyd have to fill out its easier to declare war on smaller countries like honduras for example where theres less paperwork here in the us there are vouchers applications database compilations formulaires questionnaires inter office memos internal communications color coded crisis updates e mail resource control privileged mail routings requisitions fyeo mail expense accounts situation reports conclusion memos data summaries spread sheets condensed sheets option lists objective statements abstracts indexing and parameter cards and you wont believe this theres even a master form that you have to fill out that lists all the forms that you will be using
2242980 no wonder it takes them so long to renew my passport
2242981 just imagine how long it takes them to sign a peace accord the peace agreement for the vietnam war started in the kennedy administration and they didnt finish the paperwork till the nixon administration its no wonder that senseless war lasted so long
2242982 how about your latest book the world jewish community and its corresponding followers in this country have almost unanimously accused you of displaying anti semitic tendencies any comment
2242983 i tried to be as objective as i could in a situation that is full of tangential reasons excuses self righteousness and convenient ignorance of historical facts on all sides let me give you my reasoning in a nut shell
2242984 just imagine for a moment that we are in the year 2100 china india japan russia and brazil have just signed a peace agreement that ends hostilities in several fronts and are now the superpowers on the planet the us is now a far away country devoted to agriculture mining cattle raising and manufacture of toys its neighbours canada and mexico are close associates and customers and further linked by a common religion that was developed in mid century
2242985 the great powers decide to create a new country in the middle of the united states it would include kansas oklahoma nebraska and missouri they would plan to resettle the refugees from tibet and outer mongolia there how do you think the natives in those states would feel especially if they are relegated to a minor role their properties taken over and can no longer raise their crops or make toys
2242986 i know what you next question is going to be what is the rationale of such move
2242987 simple the claim was made that before the europeans arrived in the new continent the local tribes had originated in asia and therefore their descendants had as much reason to settle in america as the ancient invaders did
2242988 interesting reasoning but full of holes mister president i could spend the rest of the day pointing at cases that could occur if backed by similar reasoning he shook his head and said
2242989 yup except that the israel palestine situation is happening now and no amount of red tape can help settle it this problem needs dedication understanding and patience
2242990 you mean diplomacy supported by a reasonable amount of red tape
2242991 absolutely as long as you keep the red tape within civilized limits
2242992 so thats why you work on the fringe too much red tape stands in the way of peace
2242993 its a tough decision bsides out involvements in afghanistan and iraq there is a guerrilla war in guatemala theres the war between the gold diggers and the brazilian indians in the amazon then of course theres the war in darfur and myarnar theres also the war between the tamil rebels and the indian government and theres also
2242994 yes i guess youre right maybe we can make a difference sometimes however i feel more like a caterer than a peacemaker
2242995 yes because when those peanut brained war faring parties meet at the conference table all they want to do is stuff their mouths with beluga caviar and french oysters drink dom perignon champagne smoke montecristo cigars and spend most of their money on women of ill repute
2242996 when theyre all recovering from their hangovers thats why they look so grim and sallow
2242997 you know how to hit the nail on the head
2242998 its probably a useful talent to have at the negotiating table
2242999 if we could only train people in the basics of peacemaking this world would be a great place everyone would know how to settle their conflicts no more divorces no more baseball strikes no more pillow fights no more elections no more traffic tickets and no more forms to fill out
2243000 i can live with that at peace with myself at peace with the world

2243006 to be chinese is to understand and accept the view that there is a correct way to perform rites associated with the life cycle
2243007 the recognition that there have been distinct dutch japanese and american strata superimposed upon the chinese substrata since the eighteenth makes the claim of taiwans chineseness problematic
2243008 organize rapidly to meet the new demands to maintain control over profitable new export trade
2243009 expanded economic opportunities and the increased need for cooperation among taiwans chinese inhabitants reduced the incidence of han subethnic strife
2243010 local boundaries and loyalties of local communities were somewhat weakened and the cultural differences that expressed and reinforced those differences were correspondingly blurred at the edges
2243011 points ironically at the authors own shameful use of the japanese in writing the text
2243012 is an oblique reference to the dormant mainland relegated to the past whereas the palpable life is here and now in taiwan
2243013 did not attempt to alter radically taiwanese culture and social structure
2243014 latent identification with the chinese was fragile and short lived
2243015 an identity produced from a common fate and common psychology
2243016 had been left out of the nationalist experience that gripped china in the early 20
2243017 vestiges of japanese influence from fifty years of colonial rule and suppressing any movement toward local taiwanese expression
2243018 a kind of colonialism which was no less foreign than the japanese interregnum that preceded it
2243019 the dictatorship of a unified language became in turn the precondition for the widespread inculcation of chinese traditional history thought and values or culture in the broad sense
2243020 we cannot deny that taiwanese culture is an extension of chinese culture
2243021 the universal assertion of a chinese consciousness is a response to the real danger posed by the equally universalizing tendency of western imperialism
2243022 sublated by a universal chinese consciousness nor reduced to a particularistic taiwanese consciousness
2243023 between orthodoxy of the center and heterodoxy of the periphery has given way to the unorthodox cosmopolitanism of taiwan popular culture

2243026 artinya dan barang apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan niscaya dia akan menggantinya
2243027 yang dimaksud dengan infaq di sini adalah infaq yang dianjurkan dalam agama seperti berinfaq kepada orang orang fakir dan berinfaq di jalan allah untuk menolong agama tafsirut tahrir wa tanwir 22 221
2243028 artinya dan barang apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan maka allah akan menggantinya dan dialah pemberi rizki yang sebaik baiknya
2243029 betapapun sedikit apa yang kamu infakkan dari apa yang diperintahkan allah kepadamu dan apa yang diperbolehkannya niscaya dia akan menggantinya untukmu di dunia dan di akhirat engkau akan diberi pahala dan ganjaran sebagaimana yang disebutkan dalam hadits
2243030 dan barang apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan maka allah akan menggantinya
2243031 dan barang apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan maka dia pasti menggantinya
2243032 allah menegaskan janji tersebut dengan kalimat bersyarat dan dengan menjadikan jawaban dari kalimat bersyarat itu dalam bentuk jumlah ismiyah dan dengan mendahulukan musnad ilaih sandaran terhadap khabar fiil nya yaitu dalam firmannya
2243033 artinya setan menjanjikan menakut nahkuti kamu dengan kemiskinan dan menyuruh kamu berbuat kejahatan kikir sedang allah menjanjikan untukmu ampunan daripadanya dan karunia dan allah mahaluas karunianya lagi maha mengetahui
2243034 maghfirah ampunan allah adalah janji allah bahwa dia akan mencukupi kesalahan segenap hambanya di dunia dan di akhirat
2243035 demikianlah peringatan setan bahwa orang yang menginfakkan hartanya bisa mengalami kefakiran bukanlah suatu bentuk kasih sayang setan kepadanya juga bukan suatu bentuk nasihat baik untuknya adapun allah maka ia menjanjikan kepada hambanya ampunan dosa dosa daripadanya serta karunia berupa penggantian yang lebih banyak daripada yang ia infakkan dan ia dilipatgandakannya baik di dunia saja atau di dunia dan di akhirat
2243036 artinya allah tabaraka wa taala berfirman wahai anak adam berinfaklah niscaya aku berinfak memberik rizki kepadamu
2243037 firman allah berinfaklah niscaya aku berinfak memberi rizki kepadamu adalah makna dari firman allah dalam
2243038 artinya dan barang apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan maka dialah yang akan menggantinya
2243039 artinya tidaklah para hamba berada di pagi hari kecuali di dalamnya terdapat dua malaikat yang turun
2243040 artinya dan barang apa saja yang kamu nafkahkan maka dialah yang akan menggantinya dan dia lah sebaik baik pemberi rezki
2243041 artinya dan mereka tiada memberi syafaat melainkan kepada orang yang diridhai allah dan mereka itu selalu berhati hati karena takut kepadanya
2243042 artinya berinfaklah wahai bilal jangan takut dipersedikit hartamu oleh dzat yang memiliki arsy
2243043 artinya ketika seorang laki laki berada di suatu tanah lapang dari bumi ini tiba tiba ia mendengar suara dari awan siramilah kebun si fulan maka awan itu bergerak menjauh dan menuangkan airnya di areal tanah yang penuh dengan batu batu hitam di sana ada aliran air yang menampung air tersebut lalu orang itu mengikuti ke mana air itu mengalir tiba tiba dia melihat seorang laki laki yang berdiri di kebunnya ia mendorong air tersebut dengan sekopnya ke dalam kebunnya kemudian ia bertanya wahai hamba allah siapa namamu ia menjawab fulan yakni nama yang didengar di awan ia balik bertanya wahai hamba allah kenapa engkau menanyakan namaku ia menjawab sesungguhnya aku mendengar suara di awan yang menurunkan air ini suara itu berkata siramilah kebun si fulan dan itu adalah namamu apa sesungguhnya yang engkau lakukan ia menjawab jika itu yang engkau tanyakan maka sesungguhnya aku memperhitungkan hasil yang didapat dari kebun ini lalu aku bersedekah dengan sepertiganya dan aku makan beserta keluargaku sepertiganya lagi kemudian aku kembalikan untuk menanam lagi sepertiganya
2243044 artinya dan aku jadikan sepertiganya untuk orang orang miskin dan peminta minta serta ibnu sabil orang orang yang dalam perjalanan
2243045 hadits itu menjelaskan tentang keutamaan bersedekah dan berbuat baik kepada orang orang miskin dan orang orang yang dalam perjalanan juga keutamaan seseorang yang makan dari hasil kerjanya sendiri termasuk keutamaan memberi nafkah kepada keluarga
2243046 fadhl karunia itu adalah bahwa allah akan mengganti kepada mereka dengan sesuatu yang lebih utama dari apa yang mereka infakkan maka allah meluaskan rizkinya dan memberinya nikmat di akhirat dengan sesuatu yang lebih utama lebih banyak lebih agung dan lebih indah
2243047 makna doa ini menurut saya adalah bahwa diantara sunnah sunnah allah adalah dia memberikan ganti kepada orang yang berinfak dengan memudahkan sebab sebab rizki baginya lalu ia ditinggikan derajatnya di dalam hati manusia sebaliknya orang yang bakhil kikir diharamkan dari yang demikian
2243048 here is change this is where we all want to be rightly belong

2243051 general what kind of training are our troops receiving prior to their arrival in the middle east
2243052 this time we are being extremely careful if not obsessive about telling our troops who they are fighting
2243053 actually no one we are trying to give them a clear idea of who is doing what to whom in iraq and to shoot when shot at
2243054 easy you see al zakiri mamun ahmed el anabad and ratko mladic under the protection of raschid aban lamad have been difficult to deal with same as mal emoahnaden who is not quite in agreement with alija izer al jahbed especially when it comes to deployments around al mutahmnay dyala and quadisimayyah all this led to the resignation of foreign minister muhamed sacirbey milhano against the wishes of mustafa al seneah bliskethzjern but this is a situation the kurd pachel enus grachev had foreseen since he had been in touch with general bulisevic and ahmed sisicant when the siege of pie al remonglanas and blotz took place you see the kurds the shiite and the sunis are being helpful and their favorite mullah an al kozyrev and his undersecretary salim al kaline have been keeping an eye on western iraq krajina and bloscash city
2243055 yes and it does not include the mess that al qaida initiated during their third incursion or about the time that petreaus appeared on the scene then it was worse as there were us troops to add to the target market
2243056 it sounds arab to me sir how can you expect the troops to remember all this when they have trouble pronouncing kucinic what happened to the traditional wars when france fought england prussia against poland italy against chicago what happened to commanders with names you could pronounce i am sure the second world war wouldnt have happened if hitlers name had been shickelgruber
2243057 also i want you to refute that claim about our troops not being properly equipped i have insisted since the day i arrived that our troops be well armed and fully backed by all types of support systems each one of our soldiers is a rambo and a walking showcase of space age weaponry they carry special transmitters in their helmets so they dont get lost night vision glasses laser equipped gun sights silencers for their automatic weapons high impact explo pills known as grenades in the old days armor piercing nra colts the new convertible rifle that can function as anti aircraft gun depth charge launcher satellite antenna and number seven iron

2243059 that is a good question and an important one you have to be properly dressed to fight a war the us armed forces can be proud of their designers and fashion corps since the eisenhower jacket to the guantanamo shorts they have been crucial in projecting the right image the gulf war was a unique exercise in desert operations and survival iraq is different

2243111 exclusively from grapes of the cognac regions two best areas
2243112 have devoted considerable time and energy at some point in our lives to looking at the arguments for and against the existence of god but not i
2243113 i decided some time ago that diminishing returns had set in on the arguments about gods existence and i doubt that any breakthroughs are in the offing from either side so what then is the point of religion
2243114 high time that we subject religion as a global phenomenon to the most intensive multidisciplinary research we can muster calling on our best minds on the planet why because religion is too important for us to remain ignorant about
2243115 i have no power or control over newbold at all none i have responsibility for and to myself and myself alone thats it
2243116 has anyone noticed that interviewing is a lot like dating
2243117 you can not add or subtract and rules in the guidelines
2243118 i made a black cloth for the prophet sal allaahu alayhe wa sallam and he put it on but when he sweated in it he noticed the odour of the wool and threw it away
2243119 i think he sal allaahu alayhe wa sallam said he liked good smell
2243120 he whom i love is i we are two souls co inhabiting one body if you see me you see him and if you see him you see me
2243121 in relation to existence he allaah is the very essence of existing things thus in a certain sense relative beings are elevated in themselves since in truth they are none other than he who bears the name abu said al kharraz
2243122 whoever does a deed that is not from me will have it rejected
2243123 it is inconceivable that one thing should love another thing in the respect that thing differs from it it can only love that thing as a result of the property of some meaning shared between the two of them in respect of which an affinity is established between them which will lead to the domination of the property of that which brings about unification over the properties which brings about differentiation but the end of love is unity in the last analysis allaah and the perfect man are one for being is one
2243124 there is none like unto him he is the all hearer the all knower
2243125 if a person exercised sufism at the beginning of the day he does not come to dhuhr except an idiot
2243126 nobody accompanied the sufis forty days and had his brain return ever
2243127 sufism is a shameful deception which begins with dhikr and ends with kufr its outward manifestation appears to be piety but its inward reality forsakes the commandments of allaah
2243128 to establish the gathering and celebration of the birthday of the messenger sallallaahualaihiwassallam to apply scents and oils on oneself on this day to sprinkle rosewater to distribute shireeni sweets to show happiness on this day in any permissible manner is mustahab liked and there are many blessings in it even today the christians celebrate sunday as the feast i e passover meal was sent down on that day and the coming of the messenger sallallaahualaihiwassallam is a better blessing and accordingly his birthday is a day of eid celebration
2243129 mawlid is a sunnah of the angels and the shaytaan runs away from it
2243130 it is established in the quran 7 that one should stand up in respect when the mawlid is mentioned
2243131 to mention stories or incidents that may cause one to cry is not permissible on the day of mawlid
2243132 he who innovates something in this matter of ours that is not of it will have it rejected
2243133 beware of newly invented matters in the religion for every newly innovated matters is an innovation and every innovation is going astray
2243134 the messenger of allah sallallaahualaihiwassallam has forbidden one to travel specifically to a grave and these innovations that take place at the graves are of evil nature the messenger of allah sallallaahualaihiwassallam himself prayed that his grave does not become a place of pilgrimage
2243135 nowadays some ignorant individuals have started some unlegislated innovated actions around the graves they have no proof for it urs and lighting up these places are all innovations
2243136 it is kufr to perform tawaff around anything other than the kaaba
2243137 to perform tawaaf of the grave of the messenger of allah sallallaahualaihiwassallam is not permissible because this is degradation and humiliation of the house of allah nowadays some ignorant people have disguised themselves as scholars and started these ignorant acts there is no place for such actions and these actions are built upon nothing but ignorance
2243138 he was a king who spent his wealth freely and he used to celebrate the mawlidun nabi he was the first person to start this celebration
2243139 he used to spend almost 300 000 deenar on this innovation every year
2243140 with him i e the king was a deviant scholar umar bin waheeyah who joined him in this action so the king gave him 1000 deenaar as a reward
2243141 he was a liar people had abandoned to act on his narrations and lowered him in the eyes of the people
2243142 one day he came to my father and in his hand was a prayer rug
2243143 at the chanting of anasheed about the mesenger sallallaahualaihiwassallam it is obligatory to stand
2243144 one who likes that people stand up for him in reverence then his destination is hellfire
2243145 there is an agreement amongst the scholars of our madhab that teeja
2243146 i have left nothing that will bring you closer to allah except that i have ordered you with it
2243147 and upon this it is necessary to make a clarification and that is the increasing of circulation of tapes of anasheed amongst the religious youth and they call them islaamic anaasheed
2243148 said imaam ibn uthaimeen in wal muhdathaat wa maa laa asla lahu p
2243149 islaamic inshaad is an innovation resembling that which the soofiyyah soofees have invented because of this it is befitting to abandon this for the message of the qur aan and sunnah
2243150 the person who has this aqeedah that the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam had the knowledge of the unseen and he is present and with us then he is a kaafir
2243151 the one who makes allaah and his messenger sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam as witnesses for nikaah then his nikaah will be invalid and the individual will become a kaafir because he held the belief that the messenger of allaah sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam had the knowledge of the unseen

2243173 the culture that had shaped young peoples understanding their thoughts their feelings and their conceptions of the world is no sure guide to the present and the elders among them bound to the past can provide no models for the future
2243174 last fall in jena louisiana when two black high school students sat under the
2243175 take their lives away with a stroke of his pen
2243176 the glory of the world is transitory and we should not measure our lives by it but by the choice we make to follow our personal legend to believe in our utopias and to fight for our dreams we are all protagonists of our own lives and it is often the anonymous heroes who leave the deepest mark
2243177 the good fight is the one that we fight in the name of our dreams it was brought from the battlefields into our very selves
2243178 ever since the time began people have recognized their true love by the light in their eyes
2243179 do not try to explain feelings live everything intensely and treasure what you feel as a gift from god
2243180 the world lies in the hands of those who have the courage to dream and who take risk of living out their dreams each according to his or her own talent
2243181 love is looking at the same mountains from different angles
2243182 life always waits for some crisis to occur before revealing itself at its most brilliant
2243183 if you have a past with which you feel dissatisfied the forget it now imagine a new story for your life and believe in it focus only on the moments when you achieved what you desired and that strength will help you get what you want
2243184 when we are high up everything looks very small our glories and our sadnesses cease to be important we have left whatever we won or lost down below from the top of a mountain you can see how large the world is and how wide the horizon
2243185 every day god gives us as well as the sun a moment when it is possible to change anything that is causing us unhappiness the magic moment is the moment when a yes or a no can change our whole existence every day we try to pretend that we do not see that moment this it does not exit that today is the same as yesterday and that tomorrow will be the same too however anyone who pays close attention to his day will discover the magic moment it might be hidden in the instant that we put the key in the door in the morning in the moment of silence after supper in the thousand and one things that appear to us to be the same this moment exists a moment in which all the strenght of the stars flows through us and allows us to perform miracles
2243186 total of 43 000 campus payroll and 3 000 student aid records were stored there giving the hacker a potential wealth of vital information that could be used for id theft

2243188 now that the busy holiday travel season is behind us some travelers think the lost luggage problems are behind us but we speak to travelers every day who are no longer willing to take that chance
2243189 whether its the frequent business traveler or the periodic leisure traveler we are seeing a growing number of people who can see the handwriting on the wall and expect things to get worse before they get better
2243190 sabili adalah contoh yang secara telanjang menunjukkan bagaimana model islam timur tengah dibawa ke indonesia

2243196 kamu boleh main sepeda keliling rumah setelah mengulang pelajaran selama lima belas menit
2243197 misalnya pulau batek yang terletak di perbatasan indonesia timor timur hingga kini masih belum ada pembicaraan di antara kedua negara mengenai bagaimana kesepakatan yang diambil untuk mengelola wilayah tersebut karena seperti blok ambalat yang kini menjadi wilayah sengketa ri malaysia kawasan itu juga kaya akan kandungan minyak
2243198 pemerintah agar lebih memperhatikan pulau pulau atau wilayah wilayah perbatasan yang rawan konflik teritorial
2243199 lagi pula itu merupakan nilai yang harus dibayar dari keteledoran kita yang selama ini cenderung menelantarkan dan malas mengurus daerah batasan terluar terutama perairan

2243201 the time for talk is over now is the time to act
2243202 in the name of freedom these websites allow the broadcast of slander lies and swearing the use of harsh degrading language and racial slurs without regard for the reader or those concerned
2243203 even though the government has been tolerant of anti government positions and criticisms on the internet we are very concerned about statements that insult religion and reek of racism
2243204 we will not permit any party to disturb the nations harmony and cause unease among the community
2243205 this is in areas not provided for by the isa sedition act or section 121b of the penal code
2243206 this is to put a stop to the freedom to lie in the blogosphere
2243207 we want blogs to be clean a place to obtain accurate information a reference point for honest opinion not a platform to abuse and slander people
2243208 but the reality is that despite the immunity mps and senators have to play by some basic rules
2243209 this is not the case with bloggers who flout the law it is time to act we have been very patient

2243213 so if he can transform into slugger he can hit 80 002 times the original slugger
2243214 oh no the stitchs is loosing can 628 enhance stitchs powers 80 002 times his stitchs powers
2243215 no if he does that he will explode back into pod form and cannot be activated unless recharged by uburnium

2243303 i had a coffee and a danish while i was out
2243304 the kids are taking tests so i came upstairs for some caffeine
2243305 i was raised on a farm in iowa i had visions of becoming a college ag professor dont ask my why except i didnt want the hard work of being a farmer i had seen enough of it growing up i got bachelors degree but just couldnt take more years in school
2243306 i found myself teaching vocational ed in a rural high school in southern indiana
2243307 i did graduate work at indiana isnt it interesting that both of us were in the same state
2243308 it can happen a lot of things go on in the midwest anyway theres a lot of difference between being at a big university and working in a small town i wasnt too happy working with those kids so many of them didnt care if they learned anything most of the parents were just as bad one thing led to another i found that there were parents that were interested in their kids education and there are a lot of kids that are eager to learn but they are held back by peer pressure from other students so i found a job helping people set up ways to do home schooling im basically an advisor i also help the kids be involved with activities such as sports music and things like that and i bring animals to the homes for study and i loan out lab equipment the dumas children are the only ones i actually teach dina has enough problems and i wanted to help her out
2243309 so kids you dont like to talk about yourself do you whats the big secret
2243310 dont you get sick of watching these kinds of shows dont you want to see something fun
2243311 why dont you just let us watch it we dont bother you
2243312 whos in charge here im staying put and you cant do anything about it
2243313 itll be lovely for you because that nice mr shields will be here can you think of anything we need from the store
2243314 everything is fine im doing the washing and tidying up is there anything needed from the stores
2243315 yes i remembered something i had to do i came up here to do it before i forgot
2243316 okay just checking i heard the door open but didnt hear anything else cant be too careful ill get back to the young uns
2243317 there was a very loud noise somewhere in this house didnt you hear it
2243318 no maybe it was the people down the street they have noisy parties sometimes
2243319 this was a loud crash we have to find out what it was
2243320 theres a whole bunch of stuff in the garage all piled up it was left here by the last people who lived here sometimes it falls down
2243321 im glad youre here early this morning i hear an awful crash i even thought a car had hit the house i couldnt find the cause
2243322 its something in the garage i bet you wouldnt believe whats in there dina can barely fit her car in it the house was owned by a widow who died no one claimed most of her things and they were just left in the house i keep telling dina to have somebody tow the stuff off its mainly junk
2243323 do you have a key we could see if anythings broken
2243324 no so we cant get into the garage let me go say hello to the young uns
2243325 i want to talk to you but first i want to see my children and talk to sid
2243326 i would appreciate it if you could have some decency to keep your voice down the children have been disturbed enough
2243327 all right marilyn if that is your real name its time for you to tell us the truth
2243328 and then i do want to hear what you have to say i was taking a short holiday with a friend down on the texas coast just a little time off cedric called me a few days ago saying he had suspicions about you you were asking a lot of questions then you upset the children the other night as it turned out tom and i stayed out too long in the sun and we both got a terrible burn you would think with my experiences with my own children i would have known better of course it was wonderful to be out in the sunshine and not worry about my little ones also my friend came down with a stomach bug and we agreed to cut short our holiday so here i am now tell me your connection with david rumbold
2243329 okay how about some other names the serenity sphere the atmos project the buddha project
2243330 what are you talking about that doesnt sound like anything at the university of indiana
2243331 indiana this has nothing to do with indiana im talking about you people who are connected with my ex husband and are trying to steal my children
2243332 youre crazy im talking about the vendetta the university of indiana has against me do the names roland scott or natalie branwell mean anything
2243333 i was working on my doctorate at indiana i specialized in twentieth century american literature well you must know how hard it is find a viable topic for ones dissertation i came across this black author of the early twentieth century little known today percival henry he was my subject i found him first not natalie
2243334 this has nothing to do with what im talking about im talking about saving my children from their crazy father who wants them to live in his crazy cult
2243335 i think there have been some mistaken assumptions okay marilyn are you or have you ever been involved in a cult
2243336 this household is very curious if i may say so ive never taken care of children where i had no idea of the parents whereabouts everything seemed to be a secret and by the way this house has strange noises there was a large crashing noise last night and i couldnt find the source
2243337 its that patio table in the garage it has a loose leg and its fallen over several times when it falls it usually knocks over something else i must get rid of all that junk
2243338 also i was asking questions because i have a right to be careful the university has waged a war against me for eight years it was bad enough to have been dismissed from the doctorate program and my name vilified i cant get any kind of teaching position i am forced to do this kind of work mind you im not complaining about being a sitter but its distressing to see natalie write a successful dissertation about early black writers in the american west she is a stupid woman but a very deceitful one of course she was sleeping with roland scott i had no chance to prove my case i admit i took those notes out of scotts desk but i was just trying to prove me case
2243339 i met david when i was in junior college in florida he was fascinating and had a great personality my parents were not impressed with him he was ten years older than me and gone from job to job he never had gone to college he was working in orlando on a type of amusement park with a religious connection i fell for everything he said hook line and sinker
2243340 i was very impressed with dr scott at first i thought i was so fortunate to be part of his department then they stuck me with teaching the poetry of anne bronte i let them know that it was not my field so i found myself teaching victorian adventure literature to students who were having trouble passing any kind of lit course sherlock homes of all things if they had given me late nineteenth century american writers i wouldnt have minded scott had a very nasty streak thats why he must be exposed
2243341 i married david and i must say the first year of our marriage was wonderful
2243342 it was at that time that davids moods became a problem
2243343 i got into my car with drake a few baby things and drove seventy five miles to my parents house i knew my marriage was over i heard nothing from david until just before dina was born he phoned me and talked as if nothing had gone wrong he wanted me to come with him to arizona and start a new life her was mixed up with some group a cult
2243344 if this is very painful you dont have to talk about it ive never married but ive never cared you do have to be so careful about emotional attachments
2243345 thats all right i can imagine what you are going through because of my own life
2243346 he is always trying to get the children theyd die under his care my parents are both dead now i now the emotional stress led to their premature deaths i was an only child i was left a comfortable inheritance but my expenses are huge and i always have the fear that david will show up
2243347 about three years ago i was living outside of chicago my mother was originally from there i had relatives still living there and i enjoyed their help and support i didnt feel so lonely i made the mistake of using my maiden name
2243348 he called one night and said he was at ohare airport and ready to come for the children of course he had no legal right to the children he was barred from any contact with them not that a court order made any difference to him he feels hes above any silly legal matter he was a disciple of this group that is waiting for jesus and buddha to return to earth i once more put my children in the car and fled to a motel on the other side of chicago of course i told my cousins one of them kept an eye on where i had been living but he never saw david i knew i had to get away and start a new life
2243349 i left indiana for the same reason they had ruined my academic standing that wasnt enough for them colleges have to worry about their reputation even the large state universities have to be concerned if it were known how badly the english department was run there would be serious questions being asked thats why they wont let me have any peace
2243350 you know marilyn i spent time in the academic world
2243351 and i know how petty they can be but ive never heard of them pursuing a former student are you sure theyre still after you
2243352 of course im well acquainted with their devious ways i was very smart and they knew it thats why they want to get me i had troubles in high school too i never was one of the popular girls and i didnt want to be good grades were my key to success i thought the other students resented me i was the valedictorian but there was some resentment tom brooks mother called the school board and said that her son deserved the honor not me people are so jealous of success in others
2243353 i legally changed my name i decided on dumas when i was studying road maps dumas is a small town in texas i came to oklahoma city because my fathers cousin lives here sid is that person he has been a great help and i am sure david knows nothing about sid
2243354 yes im proud of how i designed work i can do at home i sell annuities and insurance over the net im just the same as an old fashioned insurance agent you know people never go to insurance offices anymore just as they dont go inside a bank but i give my customers a personal touch its not like communicating with another computer i also have a web page for parents with children that problems like my dears i have heard from parents in europe
2243355 i dont use the internet its so frightening with all those viruses and hackers getting into your computer i can just imagine what the university would do to me
2243356 if you want i can show you how to use the internet safely believe me i have to watch out for david and that cult i should tell you that the cult used to have a web page but it disappeared through a net cult watch page i found out that the group had disbanded but there was a small group still together in mexico so you see i never relax my vigilance
2243357 i know how that is you know with the internet i could check on those people at the university of indiana
2243358 i hate to interrupt but if you girls are okay ill shove off
2243359 im so glad we met marilyn im sorry i was suspicious of you but you can understand cant you
2243360 yes and if i had been you i would have felt the same its so nice to finally know someone who understands me you know dina if i can help you take care of the children ill be glad to do it that is if i dont have another job i do need the money
2243361 thats very kind of you this friend of mine tom i enjoy being with him he wants to marry me but im not sure it would work out he hasnt met the children yet i dont know if he could live as i do but i do enjoy being able to go away with him
2243362 i think youre right to take your time on another marriage its so hard to be sure about people as you well know
2243363 ill call you soon marilyn maybe we can get together while sid is here

2243368 when foucault gives his grand narrative of epidemiology he can only be mistaken for to believe that technological advance forecloses the possibility of an age of epidemic as linda singer has called the contemporary sexual regime is finally evidence of a phantasmatic projection and a vainly utopian faith

2243424 who was that person who was so willing to sacrifice her relationships for a paycheck
2243425 the time for talk is over now is the time to act
2243426 in the name of freedom these websites allow the broadcast of slander lies and swearing the use of harsh degrading language and racial slurs without regard for the reader or those concerned
2243427 even though the government has been tolerant of anti government positions and criticisms on the internet we are very concerned about statements that insult religion and reek of racism
2243428 we will not permit any party to disturb the nations harmony and cause unease among the community
2243429 this is in areas not provided for by the isa sedition act or section 121b of the penal code

2243431 we want blogs to be clean a place to obtain accurate information a reference point for honest opinion not a platform to abuse and slander people
2243432 but the reality is that despite the immunity mps and senators have to play by some basic rules

2243457 yemen operates on a different timeline than we do we had one group working on a new york minute and another on a 4 000 year old history
2243458 i felt both sides were over the top the fbi in demanding complete autonomy in a foreign country and state in being too protective of the host country and eventually it just turned into a clash of wills
2243459 sometimes when you deal with a host country you can push too hard and it backfires and you get less cooperation
2243460 we needed to find a middle ground and we had difficulty getting there
2243461 we knew where he was but we could not arrest him

2243464 this was someone who was implicated in the cole bombing
2243465 everybody makes deals with anybody who cooperates not just in yemen but in the united states
2243466 it isnt our battle only our tragedy and what makes things worse is that al qaeda is united and our coalition is divided even though we have a common enemy
2243467 it was all very strange after these people were convicted in unfair trials all of a sudden it was announced that they had escaped and then the government announced they had surrendered but we still dont know how they escaped or if they had help
2243468 i was just flat told that he wouldnt meet with us
2243469 before him president clinton promised wed go out and get these people and of course we never did im sorry but its just like the lives of american servicemen arent that important

2243707 i dont talk about politics with my friends or colleagues
2243708 maybe if it affects business but just to be having lunch and start talking about politics no
2243709 nobody standing for the duma elections is actually doing so based on real ideas except the communists
2243710 everyone else uses a party platform to advance their own personal or business interests and of course the trouble with the communists is that their ideas arent very attractive any more
2243711 but people remember that when he was mayor in the 1990s he got things done and unlike everyone else here hes not corrupt

2243716 we organize annual employee conferences when everybody comes to our headquarters to norway our ukraine team has high stability because we involve them in the company

2243738 our people are poor because they lack the resources to use the soil and the water we have

2243740 here in malawi deep fertilizer subsidies and lesser ones for seed abetted by good rains helped farmers produce record breaking corn harvests in 2006 and 2007 according to government crop estimates corn production leapt to 2 7 million metric tons in 2006 and 3 4 million in 2007 from 1 2 million in 2005 the government reported
2243741 the rest of the world is fed because of the use of good seed and inorganic fertilizer full stop

2243750 weve got a commitment theyre going to work with us to process a permit to approve a third border crossing by early next year

2243752 i would have been happy if it was the end of 2008

2244138 we gaan er volgende zaterdag absoluut voor we hebben een kleine voorsprong in handen en we zijn niet van plan die nog uit handen te geven volgende week spelen we met dezelfde ingesteldheid als vandaag geen betonvoetbal maar voetbal om te winnen
2244139 de laatste vier seizoenen stonden we drie keer in de eindronde maar telkens sneuvelden we in de eerste ronde dit jaar moet het eindelijk voor ons lukken
2244140 maar onze belangrijkste transfer is dat we de ploeg voor volgend seizoen zo goed als bijeen hebben gehouden op dries van eenoo en marijn vanhallemeersch na
2244141 hi i can be reached at 435 44 32 111 right now please tell anyone who tries to reach me to call that number using a dynamic dns service to arrange for computers to find you even though you are using a dynamic ip address is the next best thing to having a static ip
2244142 aku bertanya kepada rasulullah saw siapakah yang lebih besar haknya terhadap wanita
2244143 i have such a passion and such a love and respect for the game and these young players
2244144 they both have enormous skills a good sense of space in the floor and good instincts for the game adjusting to university life is tough enough and the school lecture schedule hampers the dedication to the game and an untimely injury due to the poor state of the court it also prevent more willingness by student to learn at the university sports complex i dont take much pride in trashing them or being too physical not since temiwa the pioneer registrar son took me back to school days dunking over my head in an extravagant style hahahaha i hate it the adjustment to college basketball as a working staff is challenging everything is a lot quicker in my department i had to grow up a lot stronger and with the help of my wife to adapt than i thought i would
2244145 excuse me are you a really bad singer or a really bad actor

2244148 spirits of devils shall go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them together to the battle of the great day of god almighty
2244149 out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet paraphrase of revelation 16 13 there shall be the spirit of popery and the spirit of mohammedanism and the spirit of heathenism all united

2244151 and the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven from the throne saying it is done
2244152 wahai anakku barangsiapa mengatakan bahwa kejahatan bisa memadamkan kejahatan suruhlah ia menyalakan dua api kemudian suruhlah ia melihat apakah api yang satu bisa memadamkan api yang lain sesungguhnya kebaikan itu akan memadamkan kejahatan seperti halnya air memadamkan api
2244153 wahai anakku berbuat baiklah kepada siapa yang berbuat buruk kepadamu tanamlah perbuatan yang baik niscaya engkau menikmati hasilnya ingatlah barangsiapa menghunus pedang kezaliman ia sendiri yang akan terbunuh dengannya dan barang siapa menggali lubang kejahatan untuk menjerumuskan saudaranya ia sendiri yang akan terjerumus kedalamnya

2244157 segera setelah itu kami melihat penurunan mencolok perilaku buruk pada anak anak
2244158 apalagi kalau menilik keberhasilan perkembangan diri seorang anak dari beberapa aspek yaitu fisik kognitif atau kecerdasan afektif atau emosional yang berupa sikap berbagi kasih sayang aspek sosial serta religi bila aspek fisik dapat berkembang maksimal dengan asupan makanan bergizi tiga aspek lainnya dapat berkembang melalui kegiatan bermain
2244159 dulu anak sudah puas dengan bermain boneka dari sisa sisa potongan kain tapi anak anak sekarang maunya barbie
2244160 bila demikian ia bisa menjadi anak atau seseorang yang sangat berbeda dengan lingkungannya
2244161 anak anak sering punya pendapat agak aneh bahwa mereka merasa tidak cukup dicintai bila mendapat hadiah murahan
2244162 ibaratnya orang tua tidak apa apa puasa asalkan anaknya senang
2244163 ing ngarso sung tuladha ing madya mangun karsa tut wuri handayani juga bisa digunakan sebagai patokan unsur keterlibatan orang tua dalam bermain
2244164 misalnya saja badan boneka barbie yang meniru bentuk model peragawati tentu sangat sulit untuk ditiru kalau tidak diberi pemahaman yang benar demi meniru bentuk tubuh barbie bisa bisa ia akan habis habisan berdiet yang justru akan mengganggu tubuhnya yang sedang tumbuh demikian juga dengan superman anak harus dibekali kesadaran bahwa tokoh itu hanya dongeng dan manusia sebenarnya tidak bisa terbang
2244165 namun ketika ia berhadapan dengan yang lebih pandai ia akan sangat kecewa ketika mengalami kekalahan ini akibat ia tidak terlatih menerima kekalahan
2244166 perlombaan perlombaan sederhana seperti yang digelar dalam rangka memperingati hari kemerdekaan ri itu sangat besar manfaatnya selain aspek sosialisasi juga menguji daya tahan selama proses bermain
2244167 pada saat menjelaskan bahwa binatang itu ciptaan tuhan orang tua bisa masuk dengan pemahaman tentang religi
2244168 belum lagi saat membeli bola ia akan memilih dengan hati hati mana yang bisa melambung tinggi ataupun yang ringan dan enak digenggam
2244169 karena tidak berbentuk anak dipaksa berpikir kreatif sekaligus imajinatif namun permainan ini hanya cocok untuk yang sudah cukup umur dan mengenal bentuk sebab kalau tidak bisa si anak justru akan frustrasi
2244170 sebenarnya juga selalu menghargai mainan sederhana seperti kartu atau menerbangkan layang layang
2244171 sungguh sulit menebak dengan pasti apa jenis yang dimaui anak anak modern yang di satu sisi sederhana tapi di sisi lain cerdas dan berpengetahuan luas

2244173 if an ingredient causes skin sensitization and is mutagenic that means that it may have the potential to cause skin cancer
2244174 if i were an airplane i would totally fly to japan then russia
2244175 is there an intruder why do you have the pistols out
2244176 you were going to try to kill yourself again werent you
2244177 ive only tried it once and that was years ago
2244178 probably what are you going to do have me put into a kennel like a dog thats what they do to crazy people you know
2244179 i dont want to advertise to the world that youre completely imbalanced
2244180 i dont know but it seemed like the only possible solution to to everything
2244181 the electron has both an intrinsic electric electric field and an intrinsic magnetic field the electrons intrinsic electromagnetic field has both energy and angular momentum
2244182 in our book we have the assumption that the electron has the electromagnetic origin the electron spin is the electrons electromagnetic field angular momentum and the electrons self energy is the electrons electromagnetic field energy
2244183 the simplest model of electron spin is a spinning electrically charged ball similar to the earth rotating about its own axis in this model the electrons rest energy equals the electrostatic potential energy of a sphere of charge e with radius
2244184 is the fine structure constant e 2 4 h c
2244185 based on the above model of electron spin the classical electron velocity is much greater than the velocity of light why did the spinning electric charged ball model fail for electron spin the basic assumption of the above electron spin model is that the electrons mass originates from electric field energy
2244186 in our book we have an assumption that the electron has electromagnetic origin
2244187 we no longer regard the electron as a point like particle instead we assume that electrons have internal structure inside the electron it has continuum spherical distribution of both electric charge and magnetic charge based upon the charge distribution and also according to the gauss laws for electric field and magnetic field we calculate the electric field and magnetic field distribution inside the electron and then we calculate electromagnetic field energy and angular momentum of the electron
2244188 then we make the assumption that both the electron mass and spin have electromagnetic origin thus we obtain the electrons self energy from the electromagnetic field energy and the electron spin from the electrons electromagnetic field angular momentum then we extend our electrons electromagnetic model to the proton and neutron the proton and neutron also have electromagnetic origin and we continue our electromagnetic model to the hydrogen and helium atoms in our book in our book we also provide a possible solution for the hydrogen atom spectrum in which the hydrogen atom spectrum is regarded as the hydrogen electromagnetic field stationary wave energy spectrum the particles that comprise all physical materials include electrons protons and neutrons all of which have electromagnetic origin therefore all materials have electromagnetic origin

2244190 during much of that decade the amphitheater was the site of free evening in the park concerts local schools held their graduation ceremonies there and the group of ancient drama performed free productions of greek classics in 1973 however the amphitheater closed due to a budget shortage vandals attacked the neglected theater and by 1980 it was unusable
2244191 so many people are moving in and they dont have a sense of place as to what this area used to be
2244192 hey heres a bunch of plastic bottles please give me my money back

2244197 now there arose up a new king over egypt which knew not joseph and he said unto his people behold the people of the children of israel are more and mightier than we come on let us deal wisely with them lest they multiply and it come to pass that when there falleth out any war they join also unto our enemies and fight against us and so get them up out of the land therefore they did set over them taskmasters to afflict them with their burdens and they built for pharaoh treasure cities pithom and raamses
2244198 and ahab told jezebel all that elijah had done and withal how he had slain all the prophets with the sword then jezebel sent a messenger unto elijah saying so let the gods do to me and more also if i make not thy life as the life of one of them by to morrow about this time and when he saw that he arose and went for his life and came to beersheba which belongeth to judah and left his servant there
2244199 now when jesus was born in bethlehem of judea in the days of herod the king behold there came wise men from the east to jerusalem saying where is he that is born king of the jews for we have seen his star in the east and are come to worship him when herod the king had heard these things he was troubled and all jerusalem with him
2244200 a painful emotion or passion excited by an expectation of evil
2244201 and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage
2244202 for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba father
2244203 that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved
2244204 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find
2244205 now therefore go to proclaim in the ears of the people saying whosoever is fearful and afraid let him return and depart early from mount gilead and there returned of the people twenty and two thousand and there remained ten thousand
2244206 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
2244207 god has not given us the spirit of fear but of power of love and of a sound mind
2244208 and he said come and when peter was come down out of the ship he walked on the water to go to jesus but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me
2244209 doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which i sware to make you dwell therein save caleb the son of jephunneh and joshua the son of nun
2244210 what i fear most overtakes me what i dread happens to me
2244211 then he which had received the one talent came and said lord i knew thee that thou art an hard man reaping where thou hast not sown and gathering where thou hast not strawed and i was afraid and went and hid thy talent in the earth lo there thou hast that is thine
2244212 let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man
2244213 and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death
2244214 and fear not them which kill the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell
2244215 will you fear god who can kill you twice over or the death that can only kill your flesh
2244216 for ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto blackness and darkness and tempest and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words which voice they that heard entreated that the word should not be spoken to them any more for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touch the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust through with a dart and so terrible was the sight that moses said i exceedingly fear and quake
2244217 the lord is not slack concerning his promise as some men count slackness but is longsuffering to us ward not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance
2244218 and when they came to nachons threshing floor uzzah put forth his hand to the ark of god and took hold of it for the oxen shook it and the anger of the lord was kindled against uzzah and god smote him there for his error and there he died by the ark of god and david was displeased because the lord had made a breach upon uzzah and he called the name of the place perezuzzah to this day and david was afraid of the lord that day and said how shall the ark of the lord come to me
2244219 but a certain man named ananias with sapphira his wife sold a possession and kept back part of the price his wife also being privy to it and brought a certain part and laid it at the apostles feet but peter said ananias why hath satan filled thine heart to lie to the holy ghost and to keep back part of the price of the land whiles it remained was it not thine own and after it was sold was it not in thine own power why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart thou hast not lied unto men but unto god and ananias hearing these words fell down and gave up the ghost and great fear came on all them that heard these things and the young men arose wound him up and carried him out and buried him and it was about the space of three hours after when his wife not knowing what was done came in and peter answered unto her tell me whether ye sold the land for so much and she said yea for so much then peter said unto her how is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the spirit of the lord behold the feet of them which have buried thy husband are at the door and shall carry thee out then fell she down straightway at his feet and yielded up the ghost and the young men came in and found her dead and carrying her forth buried her by her husband and great fear came upon all the church and upon as many as heard these things
2244220 ye that fear the lord trust in the lord he is their help and their shield
2244221 and they departed quickly from the sepulchre with fear and great joy and did run to bring his disciples word
2244222 the fear of the lord is to hate evil pride and arrogancy and the evil way and the froward mouth do i hate
2244223 behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not
2244224 and he said i heard thy voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself
2244225 wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned
2244226 therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new
2244227 and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god
2244228 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
2244229 where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he
2244230 for as he thinketh in his heart so is he
2244231 as a man thinketh in his heart so is he
2244232 and he said unto her daughter be of good comfort thy faith hath made thee whole go in peace while he yet spake there cometh one from the ruler of the synagogues house saying to him thy daughter is dead trouble not the master but when jesus heard it he answered him saying fear not believe only and she shall be made whole
2244233 faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word of god
2244234 and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of israel saying the land through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great stature
2244235 and when the servant of the man of god was risen early and gone forth behold an host compassed the city both with horses and chariots and his servant said unto him alas my master how shall we do
2244236 but when he saw the wind boisterous he was afraid and beginning to sink he cried saying lord save me
2244237 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty
2244238 hereafter i will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me
2244239 and it shall come to pass that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear shall fall into the pit
2244240 for god hath not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind
2244241 okay okay making out with a meryl streep goat hybrid or milking danny devito
2244242 if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways then will i hear from heaven and will forgive their sin and will heal their land
2244243 wait a minute i cant pray i dont know what to say or how to say it

2244272 enriching the soul we obtain wisdom our journey in this life is to enrich the soul and gain wisdom and it is up to us to choose the path we want to follow and achieve it we are able to decide a happy path with abundance instead a painful one you have the right to ask

2244285 but manytimes in ourlives we face many cistumstances thats force us to believe and just face it through eventhough its hard eventhough its difficult eventhough it just like hit a big rock but it force us to believe on something in our god or in ourselves to face it through

2244300 wasit sebenarnya sudah akan memberi hadiah penalti namun ketika kiper melakukan intimidasi penalti hilang dan justru ronaldo mendapat kartu ini jelas keputusan yang salah
2244301 buat apa dia melakukan diving dia sudah melewati kiper dan tinggal melakukan hat trick jadi tak ada alasan untuk diving jadi tak adil bagi ronaldo mendapatkan kartu kuning
2244302 ronaldo harus membayar itu untuk reputasinya padahal dia bukan pemain nakal dia sudah matang dan pemain hebat yang tidak mendapat perlakuan layak
2244303 niemi cuma berusaha mengatakan kepada wasit bahwa dirinya tidak menyentuh ronaldo dan memang dia tidak menyentuhnya
2244304 ronaldo melompat dan tersandung dia melompat dan meluncur ke arah lain untuk mencetak gol dengan mudah tapi terjatuh sendiri dan akibatnya mendapat kartu kuning
2244305 ronaldo mengklaim dapat penalti tapi wasit menilai itu diving dan saya pikir kami beruntung
2244306 menang 2 0 begitu menyenangkan meski fulham memiliki penguasaan bola yang banyak kami bermain ngotot jadi harusnya lebih banyak gol yang terjadi

2244310 if youre infallible and you know it raise your hands
2244311 wave your hands in the air like you just dont care
2244312 sulit bagi wasit untuk melihat apa yang terjadi saya pikir memang tidak ada kontak fisik dan wasit tidak memberikan hadiah penalti tapi ronnie memang berusaha menghindarkan benturan dengan niemi
2244313 ronaldo mampu mencetak berbagai gol dari sisi manapun dia adalah pemain bintang buat kami dan pastinya dia bisa mencetak gol dia memang mempunyai reputasi buruk diving ketika pertama kali bergabung tapi sifat itu telah dihilangkannya

2244360 i have a great interest in tennis and im a tennis player
2244361 were not looking for any notoriety or anything its really not that much money
2244362 i thought they could move faster and beat out battlement mesa
2244363 i think we need more tennis i grew up in grand junction and i hope that someday our tennis program can rival theirs
2244364 its certainly not a done deal but his donation makes the decision easier
2244365 it would be really nice to be able to play tennis year round
2244366 i just want to help the city to offer different activities for kids
2244367 the community center its part of the community so its encouraging community tennis
2244368 were not going ahead this year for the lateness of the year and budgetary constraints
2244369 when we voted unanimously to get this bubble it was only 8 000 and i figured there would be some costs over and above that
2244370 but it astounds me when we talk about the cost coming to 440 000
2244371 this thing kind of grew and grew and grew and went from a project that was going to cost practically nothing to 440 000
2244372 im all for the bubble but we need four courts besides it
2244373 we have an ice rink thats not as usable in summer i think it would be a real draw it would bring people here and it would keep people here
2244374 i think if more courts are built it would be more beneficial
2244375 if we put the bubble in it would cost 12 to 16 per hour in order to recoup the cost of operations
2244376 im still optimistic well still be building something in the spring
2244377 theres an overwhelming desire to still make the bubble work
2244378 what they decided to do is raise the money that would be the shortfall
2244379 what we want and what we can afford are dramatically different
2244380 it was a good meeting and we had a lot of good public input
2244381 they certainly gave the impression theyd do whatever it took
2244382 they said they wanted to do anything they could to make it happen
2244383 whenever i go by copper mountain i think those people are lucky they can play all winter
2244384 ive played in this bubble probably 200 times and i think you stole it
2244385 i dont want to open up the community center next year without any tennis courts
2244386 it makes all the sense to me to build four courts now
2244387 why did we bother asking for public input on this
2244388 by foregoing this we are essentially throwing the bubble away
2244389 im saying there could be ways we could make this happen
2244390 the bubble isnt dead its just waiting in the boneyard until the right donors come along
2244391 at the parks and recreation meeting the community was 2 1 in favor and city council didnt want to listen we wanted the bubble
2244392 theres a lot of strong feelings both ways but the bottom line is we have four new courts so the tennis community wins
2244393 i have a hard time looking at this as a loss for the tennis community
2244394 the city hasnt built tennis courts for 20 years i look at this as a huge step forward
2244395 well so that is that now we must dismantle the tree putting the decorations back into their cardboard boxes some have got broken and carrying them up to the attic the holly and the mistletoe must be taken down and burnt and the children got ready for school
2244396 there are enough left overs to do warmed up for the rest of the week

2244438 huds action to move forward with banning privately funded downpayment assistance programs is outrageous and we have responded by filing a lawsuit in federal court yesterday to challenge the merits of huds damaging rule and to seek an injunction blocking implementation of this rule it is inconceivable that hud has taken this action in complete disregard for the houses passage of legislation that would block it driven by strong bipartisan support from house financial services sub committee on housing opportunity chair congresswoman maxine waters d california and fellow committee member congressman gary miller r california to date privately funded downpayment assistance programs have helped over 600 000 families become homeowners and have been credited not only for helping people buy homes but also stabilizing neighborhoods and cities and creating stronger families as evidenced by the over 15 000 letters sent in opposition to hud by families across the country programs like the nehemiah program continue to be a lifeline for families working to reach the dream of homeownership further broad opposition to this proposal by groups including the national association of home builders the mortgage bankers association the us council of mayors and national association of counties speak to the validity and importance of seller funded downpayment assistance programs we remain hopeful that the legislative process reaches a successful conclusion

2244505 i want donald to return to the white house but not before ive had a chance to sink my double edged sog into his fat fish white belly hes a dead man ill carve his ass up like an overcooked christmas goose i really want his thumbs i just want to cut off his thumbs as trophies theyre huge hes got giant thumbs

2244507 apparently strom got a little randy and let his mouth run wild while talking to condi well before he knew it she had him tied up cut off his ear doused him with gasoline and then shot him in the chest four times and all of this occurring on the senate floor while dancing around to hits of the 70s it was demented and gruesome especially the 70s music
2244508 it would be like pitting your senile half blind grandfather against a terminator cyborg infected with rabies and the terminator has razor sharp scissors instead of fingers

2244512 we always march around this time of year to raise awareness about obesity and obese issues
2244513 americans need to realize that not everyone is made just one size but unfortunately thats the world we have created a single serving size for all americans the fact is other individuals big boned people for instance are not being considered in movie theaters and airplanes and that sad fact is creating an american tragedy we developed this awareness march to draw attention to the burgeoning world of the obese
2244514 even though we had only been marching about 35 feet i was beginning to feel emaciated suddenly i could almost taste the gooey white filling in my mouth the dark crumbly cookies coating the sides of my mouth the next thing i knew i had someones ear in my mouth and i was trying to pull it off his head and split it apart like an oreo cookie later i learned white gooey stuff i was licking wasnt cookie filling it was the white matter from his skull
2244515 we were marching down the street and well some of us were perspiring slightly i didnt realize how far an 1 8 th of mile could actually be well i could feel myself becoming more and more ravenous with each bone grinding step the sweat was burning my eyes horribly so i couldnt see anything but my nose oh shit my nose could smell everything that fucking sweet nabisco truck was carrying a full case of the smell was absolutely overpowering i felt so sick with lust that at some point i just blacked out when i regained consciouness i was gnawing on someones left arm
2244516 oh dear yes i was marching along toward the oreos and suddenly i realized this wasnt about cookies anymore it was a mob feeding frenzy i felt like a shark in some terrible pool full of unsuspecting fish it was absolutely exhilarating i bit the first person i could grab and they were absolutely delicious cocoa butter and sweat yummy
2244517 yep once the smell of them cookies got out there you could hear them shrieking and moaning
2244518 then they just started pushing each other to get to the cookies and then they just crushed each other never seen anything remotely like it the really heavy ones started running for the cookies and just collapsed clutching at their hearts soon as they went down three more would jump on top of em and strip those bones clean like amazonian piranhas it was horrific
2244519 the sky was literally black with the spray of oreo cookie crumbs it blocked out the sun and day was as night and the snarling of the beasts drowned out all sound
2244520 in all my years on the force ive never witnessed anything like this i im sorry im a little shook up right now

2244812 that is just what i had planned to do to you when i got down here or anywhere as a matter of fact i was doing some thinking and i have realized that i am a real fool and i am here wasting my time when i can just marry the woman i love and be happy i want to make you happy i want what is best for raven sandra and krisse seriously i love you alia
2244813 okay everyone i know alia shes alright she just has a problem with perfection she was probably just ashamed that she was being asked to be married while her daughter is in hospital and she is in a waiting area to see if she survives
2244814 so a man just basically poured his heart out to her ready to start a life a better life with her and their children and she is worried about how he did it
2244815 i really want to talk to sandra i want to ask her to marry me as well since everyone has all the same plans
2244816 okay good news sandra is going to be just fine all it was was a major asthma attack so right now she is on oxygen to bring her back
2244817 i am sorry but didnt make it that was the end of part 9 the only question is who has not made it also where is raven timothy and alia what are they really doing sister
2244818 jika bapa bapa anak anak saudara saudara isteri isteri kaum keluargamu harta kekayaan yang kamu usahakan perniagaan yang kamu khawatiri kerugiannya dan tempat tinggal yang kamu sukai adalah lebih kamu cintai dari allah dan rasul nya dan dari berjihad di jalan nya maka tunggulah sampai allah mendatangkan keputusan nya

2244820 get out of the house the call is coming from the upstairs bathroom
2244821 it sounded like a person with bronchitis who was screaming
2244822 since we were able to do it it only made sense to cash out of ventura while the market was high and do what most people just dream of retire early in paradise i continue to help others who are ready to get off the wheel in the hamster cage and escape to paradise not a day in boquete goes by that im not happy to be in panama and my only wish is that we would have done this sooner
2244823 ah saya mau berhenti saja jadi cinta mending saya diganti yang lain saja
2244824 heh cin sudah dari dulu saya tahu cinta itu begitu makanya saya dan dia tidak mau menyebut kami sebagai cinta tapi kami ini takdir
2244825 heh tolong ya mulutmu dijaga jangan coba coba mengganti cinta dengan takdir yang taik kucing itu kamu sendiri karena cinta ya cinta dan kamu dan dia itulah cinta tapi kalian tak mau mengakuinya kamu tak tahu apa apa tenntang cinta jadi jangan coba angkat bicara mengenai saya cinta begitu arif cinta begitu adil dan cinta begitu universal untuk siapa saja jelas kamu
2244826 oh jadi begitu saya dengar cinta juga tidak memandang wujud dan usia lalu jika cinta memang mempersatukan jiwa maka kesenjangan tubuh macam apakah yang akan bisa menghalanginya justru itu masalahnya apakah saya sebagai manusia biasa yang menjadi bayangan absurd masih bisa mencintai kekasihku yang mungkin kekasihku itu telah berubah wujud menjadi seekor buaya misalnya
2244827 sudah sudah cukup pembicaraan kita membuat saya tambah pusing dan kau membuatnya semakin tidak jelas kamu yang tak pernah paham atau aku yang tak memahamkan
2244828 misalnya ada orang yang seperti artis berarti dia bukan artis hanya mirip
2244829 yah berarti bukan cinta hanya seperti cinta yang terasa tapi tak boleh dibilang cinta
2244830 tidak ada yang salah hanya mengapa kamu selalu membuat semuanya remang
2244831 karena cinta yang jelas dan terang yakin dan pasti biasa dan lurus seperti bukan cinta lagi yah kadang begitu bukan kamu pasti tak paham kata kataku yah
2244832 ssst diamlah diam sini mendekat saja karena kita butuh dekat dan tak butuh kata kata sebenarnya cinta tidak membutuhkan kata kata karena kata kata hanya akan mengacaukannya
2244833 maksudku jangan bicara tentang cinta karena lebih baik dirasakan dan dinyatakan tidak usah dirumuskan
2244834 keindahan dalam keremangan masihkah akan tetap indah dalam dunia yang jelas dan terang
2244835 aku takkan memasukkan apapun kata katamu dalam otakku karena kadang aku hanya ingin aku ingin
2244836 yah kadang aku ingin sekali melihat bahu pundak dan lehermu dalam telanjang maaf aku tak pernah sejujur ini sebelumnya kau pasti tak pernah tahu betul rasanya bagaimana
2244837 mengapa harus marah itu hal yang sangat wajar manusiawi perasaan manusia tak perlu ditekan tekan luapkan saja asal tidak kaulakukan maksudku
2244838 oh bukan tunggu dulu kau tak paham maksudku kau benar2 tak tahu
2244839 sini kuberi tahu kau kira itu cinta yah tapi baru aku tahu kau cuma nafsu
2244840 yah kau kau itu nafsu tepatnya menafsuiku dan itu sama seperti lainnya masih tak pahamkah kau kau betul kalau ini seperti cinta karena kau memang tak pernah mencinta hanya berupaya seperti cinta yah kau ini seperti cinta tapi bukan cinta
2244841 lalu mengapa aku sering kangen pada gejolakmu maksudku tawa ceriamu itu yang kadang tak tahu kau berada di mana dan sedang apa jadi itu hanya seperti cinta
2244842 begitu lalu apakah kau pernah berpikir kira kira aku melakukan hal yang sama
2244843 belum selesai bahkan memulai saja kita tidak pernah apa yang perlu diselesaikan
2244844 aku tidak pernah keberatan menunggu siapapun berapa lamapun selama aku mencintai orang yang kutunggu itu please
2244845 kau sering bicara cinta padahal kau tak tahu apa apa tentang cinta berapa tanggal lahirku apa kebiasaan jelekku
2244846 yah sekali lagi kau kau bilang cinta tanggal lahirku saja kau tak tahu bahkan kejelekan aku saja kau tak bisa mengenalinya engkau saja tak bisa mengerti kejelekanku bagaimana bisa menerima hal hal yang tidak kausukai nanti
2244847 hey kau jangan memakiku seperti itu bisa saja kau memaki ketika bertemu tapi nanti akan saling mengenang ketika berpisah
2244848 bukan berulangkali kau bukan apa apa bagiku masih harus banyak belajar untuk itu
2244849 sudahlah dari tadi aku benci berkata kata ini rasa ini soal rasa
2244850 kalau aku memang tidak pernah tahu apa apa ajarilah aku banyak hal
2244851 tunggu aku belum selesai ngomong dan jika seseorang sudah mati selama kita masih mengingatnya dan mengenangnya berarti tidak ada perpisahan sama sekali
2244852 sekarang aku mau tanya apakah pikiranmu dan pikiranku sempat berpisah
2244853 apakah benar kau tidak pernah memikirkan aku sedetikpun pernah tidak aku terpaut di benakmu karena kalau aku tak pernah sedetikpun aku tidak memikirkanmu
2244854 njing kamu mau gombalin aku apaan sih yah pernahlah aku mikirin kamu hhh justru justru
2244855 justru di saat kau memikirkanku maka pada detik itu juga aku lebih menggilaimu
2244856 mau aku kamu ingin tahu mau aku mau aku cuma kita saja yang ada di dunia ini sehingga tidak akan ada seorangpun yang menganggap kita ini gila
2244857 karena kau juga menyakitiku kau tahu apa itu cinta cinta adalah ingin selalu ada di dekat orang yang dicintai bukan menghindari jika kamu cinta kamu bisa melakukan hal hal gila yang kamu sendiri tidak bisa ngerti jika kamu cinta kamu akan berikan semua tanpa berpikir dua kali jika kamu cinta kamu akan perjuangkan cintamu dan kamu kamu enggak taik
2244858 maafkan aku mungkin karena aku yang keparat aku bukan malaikat itu aku cuma setan aku marah karena tak milikimu aku pecemburu itu saja
2244859 ah aku baru penjajakan kalau jodoh dan cocok aku siap sama dia kalau nggak yah cari lagi karena kupikir kamu samasekali lupa maka aku mengusahakannya kamu harus mengusahakannya karena kamu tak mungkin denganku
2244860 kamu tidak memperjuangkan aku sih kamu asyik asyikan sendiri akhirnya akupun menembak bulan walaupun harus kehilangan matahari
2244861 jangan berkata begitu manusia berencana tuhan yang nentuin setidaknya hatimu sudah bebas dariku iya kan
2244862 hatimu bebas dan kau boleh memiliki apa yang kau inginkan apa ada yang kamu sukai sekarang ini atau lagi kangen seseorang
2244863 iya ibu manusia yang baik akan menikah dengan manusia yang baik pula walaupun sebelum itu harus bertemu dengan malaikat yang sesat atau setan beriman hehehehe ibu aku sekarang berusaha membuatmu selalu tersenyum
2244864 no os busqu is la muerte con los extrav os de nuestra vida no os atraigas la ruina con las obras de vuestras manos que no fue dios quien hizo la muerte ni se recrea en la destrucci n de los vivientes l todo lo cre todo lo cre para que subsistiera las criaturas del mundo son saludables no hay en ellas veneno de muerte ni imperio del hades sobre la tierra por que la justicia es inmortal pero los imp os con las manos y las palabras llaman a la muerte teni ndola por amiga se desviven por ella y con ella conciertan un pacto pues bien merecen que les contenga por suyos
2244865 santa muerte como due a poderosa de la negra mansi n de la existencia y de la vida emperatriz de las tinieblas quiero que me hagas el gran favor de que zutano decir el nombre no me deje de querer y has que arrastrado y humillado venga a mis pies que no vuelva m s a irse nuevamente de mi lado mientras a mi me sirva

2244867 ada dua penyebab mengeringnya mata air yakni akibat hujan yang sudah tidak turun serta rusaknya lingkungan sekitar
2244868 keberadaan mata air sangat vital bagi penduduk sebab biasanya mereka sangat tergantung dengan mata air setempat
2244869 setiap hari ada 500 meter kubik kayu di banyumas yang ditebang jumlah tersebut setara dengan 1 500 batang pohon padahal mata air membutuhkan sedikitnya 400 batang pohon sebagai penyimpan air dengan kondisi semacam itu kalau pohon pohon yang ditebangi berada di sekitar mata air maka dapat dipastikan mata air bakal mengering kemudian mati kita memperkirakan jika tidak ada upaya serius dalam waktu lima tahun mata air di banyumas tidak ada lagi
2244870 kami sudah tidak dapat lagi memanfaatkan sumber mata air di sini karena mengering
2244871 karena mata air mengering terpaksa kita mencari air ke sumur milik warga tetangga desa

2244875 la nica diferencia entre un ser animal y un humano es la inteligencia por ello debemos forzarnos a actuar inteligentemente y consecuentemente principio de abstenerse de elegir da ar a un ser humano tenemos que tener cierto cuidado en no destruir la identidad de los dem s aunque no sea posible medir el alcance de nuestros actos y de ninguna manera debemos elegir conscientemente hacer el mal hay que diferenciar entre elegir y aceptar
2244876 muchos hablamos de el esfuerzo que realizamos en aras de promover la realizaci n humana pero ser que si nos estamos esforzando lo suficiente o ser que no estamos utilizando los m todos m s eficaces he ah el meollo del asunto hay que esforzarse si pero por usar las principio de la responsabilidad del papel que hay que desempe ar
2244877 la aceptaci n es un principio que debemos cultivar en nuestro diario vivir ya que todas nuestras acciones no son acertadas y probablemente estas provocaran efectos colaterales perjudiciales
2244878 aunque suene un tanto parad jico y un tanto enredado ante ciertas circunstancias de la vida puede ser razonable cooperar en actos inmorales de otras personas

2244895 apparently republicans believe in taking care of their vanquished as a higher priority than taking care of their own and their children and their grandchildren who will suffer mightily under the national debt republicans have burdened them with
2244896 and let s not forget those oh so fiscally responsible republicans when they had complete control of the white house and congress
2244897 jim one thing i ve seen time and time again is the republicans accusing the dems of being fiscally irresponsible and then turn out to be more irresponsible than the dems ever have been
2244898 which presidents gave us a surplus hint clinton and which presidents each gave us deficits successively greater than all previous deficits combined hint reagan bush i bush ii
2244899 intent on buying popularity he watered and grew the great society programs that lyndon johnson had seeded and he increased entitlement spending by a startling four percent of gdp
2244900 while most economists are celebrating the arrival of the first surplus since president lyndon johnson engineered one in 1969 with a temporary 10 percent surcharge on income taxes
2244901 only 5 of the past 40 budgets have been surpluses all 5 were by democratic presidents the twenty years of budgets prepared by republican presidents increased the national debt by 3 800 000 000 000 the average yearly deficit under republican budgets was 190 billion the twenty years of budgets prepared by democratic presidents increased the national debt by 719 500 000 000 the average yearly deficit under democratic budgets was 36 billion
2244902 what i am saying is the dems are no better than the reps when it comes to being utterly incapable of living within a budget
2244903 victory at all costs victory in spite of all terror victory however long and hard the road may be
2244904 our goal was never to conquer and occupy iraq it was always to stay as long as necessary and not longer nobody has ever articulated anything else except our opponents
2244905 my only goal is to do what is best for the u s from this point on
2244906 win victory success that would allow us to bring the troops home
2244907 through violence you may solve one problem but you sow the seeds for another
2244908 i think they are trying to get the watchful eye of the us off of their actions so they can clean house of the sunnis and kurds and take power for themselves
2244909 biasanya menjelang puncak kemarau seperti bulan november tapi sekarang baru awal agustus air laut sudah masuk
2244910 setiap musim kemarau memang seperti ini lahan pertanian di sini itu tadah hujan kalau tidak ada hujan seperti sekarang ya dibiarkan bero tidak ditanami para petani hanya memamen ketela pohon yang ditanam pada musim hujan lalu
2244911 biasanya kalau air sudah sulit ada dorp dropan air dari pdam
2244912 kalau tanaman padi kan harus banyak airnya jadi kami jelas tidak mampu
2244913 kemungkinan puncaknya nanti pada akhir agustus 2007 dengan catatan selama bulan ini tidak hujan
2244914 pompa air tersebut merupakan bantuan dari pemprop jawa tengah dan pemkab banyumas sejak tahun 2002 hingga sekarang kondisi pompa air masih bisa dipakai untuk menyedot air dari sungai ke sawah
2244915 as a new mom i know that i need gods help more than ever but im too exhausted to even think i dont really have much of a desire to pray or read the bible
2244916 i have another cousin named moana and she got a tattoo on the back of her neck that says
2244917 look you came through that everything is going to be ok
2244918 i have to see it i cant tell you id vote for or against something that i havent seen
2244919 we have plenty of land to meet the housing needs of our great grandchildren and beyond and to provide them with plenty of open space and agricultural products
2244920 the major issues impacting the health of the springs include population growth urban sprawl growing demand for groundwater and introduction of fertilizers pesticides and other pollutants to the spring sheds
2244921 what did we think he meant in that line or how why would he use that phrase the way he did
2244922 sa daruiesti totul sa sacrifici totul fara speranta de rasplata asta inseamna iubire
2244923 trust in the lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding in all your ways acknowledge him and he will direct your paths
2244924 wait a minute nobody told me that a relationship with god is like skiing downhill in the swiss alps as a beginner with no lessons
2244925 falta de lealdade e fidelidade por parte do executivo e do partido socialista local

2244927 somos um movimento que n o est contra ningu m nem mesmo contra os partidos pol ticos ali s o movimento at pode ter um efeito regenerador no seio dos partidos pois obriga os a adoptar outra postura
2244928 simplesmente defender e melhorar a qualidade de vida dos cidad os de odivelas
2244929 hoje existem mais condi es para o surgimento de movimentos c vicos porque as pessoas est o cansadas do modo como gerida a causa p blica e por isso cada vez se afastam mais da participa o c vica neste movimento as pessoas ter o total liberdade e autonomia pois n o olhamos a cores partid rias
2244930 tem sido bem recebido pelos odivelenses que t m demonstrado um grande interesse em participar
2244931 h muita gente que se cruza comigo na rua e me vem falar do movimento e no seu interesse em participar nele isto quer dizer alguma coisa
2244932 irrespons veis e sem rumo por n o estabelecerem as reais prioridades

2244959 the need for democracy is rapidly declining in the western hemisphere who needs to choose political representation when you can go to best buy and purchase an i phone the need for democratic process is dying away as long as shiny new goods and services are available in abundance why should i care who inhabits the white house i want to know if my new dodge has a hemi not who voted on a farm aid bill really who cares
2244960 do you think george washington would have fought the british if they had brought over a new shipment of mac powerbooks and i pods from merry old england by all means no he wouldve spent the winter at valley forge downloading hot new movies and kickin r amp b who wants to fight for freedom when you can download tunes and videos in high def
2244961 currently we have a president in the oval office that has failed to capture osama bin laden started a failing expensive war under false pretenses engaged in torture and illegal wire tapping suspended habeas corpus vetoed a bill to give health care to poor children and adulterated and politicized the justice department ha nobody cares we might as well have a autocratic monarchy because no one really cares what the current government does why dont we care because we can buy whatever we want the american dream is still being fulfilled and that dream involves purchasing as many bright shiny objects as humanly possible bravo brave new world democracy was and is a great starter program to put the financial infrastructure in place to allow americans to borrow money to buy new things democracy doesnt make americans happy a new fire engine red bmw suv with all wheel drive makes them happy take that democracy
2244962 it just takes too much time to keep up on all the stuff they talk about blah blah blah
2244963 id have to sit down and read things like books and paper stuff ugh it makes my eyes and head hurt id rather watch 24 and football games and reruns of dirty dancing that shit rocks
2244964 all politicians are corrupt so who cares who we have in office
2244965 all they do is lie and cheat and steal i can watch that on desperate houswives on my new plasma screen tv and enjoy the drama real life and politics kind of suck they should take politicians put them all in house together for three months and call it real politician world id watch that especially if hillary is hooking up with someone ooooh that would be sooooo hot
2244966 this is absurd democratic government is the basis for the freedoms americans have come to love it is the foundation of the bill of rights and the constitution americans have forgotten what it means to be governed by individuals that suppress individual liberties i cannot believe the apathy that exists in our society today every good citizen should be engaged in their government both at a local and a national level
2244967 that being said would you like to see my new pda sat phone its 60gig with bluetooth and planetary wifi friggin awsome
2244968 we took 10 healthy male volunteers aged 17 to 20 put them in bare walled prison with a flea infested itchy wool blanket and a coffee can to relieve themselves in

2244971 berkomentar dengan bahasa bombastis dan meledak ledak bisa saja kita lakukan namun saya tidak pernah mendapatkan dauroh yang mengajarkan dakwah itu tidak bil hikmah yang dilakukan dengan cara cara seperti itu
2244972 i wanted to show i could pull off a genuine laugh without actually injuring my face i think my laughter shows the overwhelming joy i have in my heart joy joy joy down in my heart where down in my heart
2244973 ive never heard a sound that could actually stop the beating of my heart
2244974 but the doctors claim i was clinically dead for 13 minutes there was no tunnel of light just darkness just the darkness and that sound coming from her face it was the most horrific moment of my life
2244975 my son billy literally began shrieking he grabbed his pet cat hector and tried to pull out all of its fur he just kept crying out make it stop mommy please make it stop or hector will be sad said houswife ede white
2244976 while i found the sound and facial expressions very disturbing i felt my visceral reaction to claw out my own eyes may have an actual usage
2244977 we have to find a way to break down prisoners and were finding that torture just doesnt really work all that well they scream and cry and tell us anything we want to hear not so good when we played the tape of hillary laughing to several inmates at guantanamo we found they broke down very quickly they still cried and screamed but they gave us solid intel you should have seen them groveling begging us to turn off the tape it was pathetic of course i couldnt hear their cries what with the ear plugs ear muffs and double blindfold i was wearing it took awhile to find the stop button on the vcr
2244978 we sat down a room full of special forces operatives seals force recon rangers and played them the tape remember these guys are stone cold killers they folded like cheap origami ive never seen anything quite like it after 10 seconds the seals in the front row collapsed into the fetal position and began sucking their thumbs a ranger in the back row tried to throw himself through a wall to escape the sound it was chaos they ended up attacking the tv unit and destroying it with their bare hands they were so completely enraged by the sound that they lost control of their minds it was a powerful testament to what this woman laughing can do to other humans
2244979 there are some primates in the animal kingdom that can create sounds so unnatural that it becomes excruciatingly painful for other humans to listen to
2244980 hillarys laughter is so forced so alien to her psyche that she ends up creating a sound that is quite literally torturous to endure it is the physiological equivalent of nails on a chalkboard for your immortal soul we can use her anguished cackle to break down prisoners of war forget shipping these poor assholes to syria to get beaten with lead pipes this is the new method of extraction
2244981 we feel the use of hillarys laughter is completely inhumane we would rather have the military use waterboarding rather than play this tape to inmates we despise the use of all torture but this crosses the line her laughter is without a doubt the worst method of torture we have ever encountered
2244982 we feel this is a valid tool that does not violate what used to be the geneva convention there are no marks on the prisoners no dark dungeon type tortures hell we can play this tape in a sunny room with filled flowers baby lambs clowns and balloons and still elicit pain from our inmates her laughter is rewriting the textbook on torture
2244983 we played this tape to dolphins swimming in a tank and they literally drove themselves into the side of the tank until they were unconscious her laughter will allow us to control the entire animal kingdom with fear and terror
2244984 i will never have that woman on my show again
2244985 she was completely deranged i wanted to punch her every time i heard that laugh and i havent punched anyone for several weeks why would she laugh like that was she high or something
2244986 her laughter is a sign of her deep seated need to try and force people to vote for her she knows its wrong but she cant help but doing it her behavior shows a callous disregard for the psyche of all those around her she needs to take a good hard look at that laugh and decide how many lives shes willing to destroy with it
2244987 i thought theyd love it its all about my joy im so happy why cant they see that well if they cant take my sweet sweet laughter then fuckem
2244988 oh yeah i booked them the first day they were on public sale
2244989 do thing the way we say because we say and dont question
2244990 oh let me tell you about this terrible toxic friendship i had
2244991 when will we arrive its going to be dark can you drive at night if not stop in a restourant to have something for dinner and have a rest till tomorrow maybe they have some place to sleep at night or we can sleep in the car because we are just two person
2244992 this would be much easier if this was a dictatorship and i was the dictator
2244993 this is great compared to say oracle where youd instead be locked into using
2244994 lord let me have more of you let me know this great great love that you have for me

2245004 i couldnt believe anyone would place a sign like that in their window i think hes a bastard for writing that my children are little angels
2245005 sure william has a penchant for gasoline and matches but what healthy child these days doesnt
2245006 my kids are hyperactive sugar guzzling gremlins and im pounding them with ritalin what more can i do
2245007 mary is a really good kid she just has trouble with authority figures and i dont want to stifle that sense of freedom and curiosity she loves to dig through peoples purses and i think thats a great thing the world is hers to explore
2245008 we actually had an incident where a little lad had grabbed a meatball and hucked it across the room at another diner well the ball was hot and it ended up scorching the face of the poor woman right then i knew it was time to act i authorized the hit and i stand by my decision the only thing i regret is the collateral damage
2245009 things were really out of control pasta and meatballs flying everywhere al dente my ass it was a war zone that kid took 24mg of isopene before his eyes glazed over and he dropped the bowtie pasta it was horrific that poor old lady just looked up at me and asked why i couldnt give her a rational answer
2245010 she wouldnt give me sea horsey so i said i hated her i hated food yuck the man shot me with a feather thing and i was tired
2245011 that waiter had no right to shoot my little billy with a dart
2245012 who knows what those horse drugs will do to him
2245013 there are no scientific studies showing any specific ill effects on children currently isopene is approved for all veterinary uses hell they use these things on million dollar racehorses do you really think theyd do that if the drugs werent safe
2245014 shooting children with horse tranquilizers while not scientifically unsound may set up a dangerous cycle of drug seeking behavior
2245015 this may encourage children to act out just so they can be tranquilized i have been treating billy for one year after the incident and i find his behavior slightly irrational he will literally attack any horse he can find biting at their legs to try and get the horsey sleepy juice he believes exists in the animals he has been trampled and kicked on multiple occasions this type of restaurant policy is clearly not in the best interest of the child that being said it does make the dining out experience much more enjoyable
2245016 i knew we needed to be more specific and the blame is really mine

2245035 the first run through we forgot about our ninja masks we had the ranch in our mouths but we forgot to pull the masks down when we faked the sneeze
2245036 the masks are non permeable the second time was the sneeze guard and we and ended up spraying ranch all over the plexiglass it was embarrassing the third time was the charm however and we blew contaminated ranch all over the salad unfortunately goode hiccupped right before the fake sneeze and he accidently swallowed some of the ranch he never made it to the bathroom man down man down
2245037 i knew the cafeteria food was bad but this this something entirely different derek never even made it to the mens room he literally shit himself right there in the cafeteria it was horrible
2245038 we knew we had to get information and get it quickly what strain of bacteria did they use what antibiotics were the bacteria resistant to these were question that needed immediate answers and we knew how to get them

2245040 dick was out walking his dog when we nabbed him you shouldve seen hillary throw down on his ass she used a wounded grouse call to pull him in and then we jumped him he never even saw it coming it was a 1 2 hit stun gun to the temple stun gun to the right quad and a plastic bag over the head we dragged him into a dunkin doughnuts truck and that was it he didnt want to talk just kept on and on about his heart condition and how he needed his pills i said to him bitch i wouldnt worry about your arrhythmia worry about na p shes gonna kung fu your fatty plaque covered heart right out of your chest and show it to you
2245041 i knew we didnt really have to worry about geneva conventions anymore and that really made things easier thank you dick cheney
2245042 i just grabbed the car battery out of my volvo and set of jumper cables when i hooked that positive lead to cheneys nipple his eyeballs almost popped out of his head i could see the electricity arcing off his teeth like darth vader in return of the jedi when he throws the emperor off the edge i couldve gotten anything out of him he wouldve told me nasa was dropping tap dancing cats on the third moon of mars if thats what i wanted to hear he was like silly putty in my thickly gloved hands he quickly told us everything about the plot including the involvement of george w in fifteen minutes we extracted all the information we needed and cheney had some smoking nipples
2245043 dick cheney was kidnapped early yesterday morning by agents of al qaeda looking to smuggle weapons of mass destruction into venezuela
2245044 nancy pelosi and hillary clinton did not i repeat did not kidnap my vice president
2245045 but he needs to realize we are here to play hardball he cannot poison the democrat party out of existence and we know he was directly responsible for providing delay with the e coli bacteria we did the lab tests and confirmed everything its texas e coli with a capital t

2245048 jangan sampai itu dari negara kita dan diriset malah itu nanti bisa dipakai untuk memusnahkan sedangkan virus flu burung di indonesia itu strainnya paling ganas
2245049 kalau bakteri enterobacter sakazakii itu patogen dari zaman baheula kita juga sudah tahu tetapi dalam dunia kedokteran pategonesis dari suatu bakteri itu tidak begitu saja menimbulkan penyakit dia harus memiliki persyaratan yang banyak dalam jumlah seberapa dalam kondisi seperti apa dan sebagainya jadi menurut saya pemerintah indonesia tidak harus menyetujui standarisasi standarisasi yang baru satu standar internasional belum tentu cocok untuk kita contohnya ya sars misalnya di singapura itu ganas betul tapi di indonesia kena sars nggak apa apa kok
2245050 sekarang pertanyaannya kan lah kok ya pas gitu juni amerika mau mengajukan bakteri itu sebagai unsur yang menjadi ketentuan susu formula tetapi kita sudah ribut soal susu formula saya nggak tahu apa ini ada hubungannya atau tidak saya tidak mengira saya memersilahkan anda sendiri yang membaca dan kalau itu sudah masuk dan kita mengikutinya maka saya kira pabrik pabrik susu yang ada di dalam negeri akan tutup semua dan pengangguran akan bertambah dan kemiskinan juga kita harus memikirkannya secara cerdas untuk bangsa kita apa yang menyelamatkan bangsa kita

2245054 the pursuit of authentic happiness is an ongoing quest for many
2245055 some people believe that by earning more money working longer hours and taking on more and more responsibility they will somehow reap big benefits that will in the end guarantee happiness unfortunately that just isnt the case and research has now proven that the more comfortable life becomes the more discontented and unfulfilled we become
2245056 i know personally what its like to become so wrapped up in one thing that everything and everyone else in life seems to disappear i experienced it years ago while building my first business i was so caught up in success and achievement that everything else took second place and i lost everything that really mattered to me my home my partner etc back then there wasnt such a thing as a life coach i took a break got my act together and reconstructed a more authentic and happy life i learned a valuable lesson and now i want to do my bit to help others realize that they too can find happiness by not denying themselves a lot of people dont have anyone to support and listen to them and thats where i come in

2245074 how large did book of mormon populations claim to be over the years and what can we deduce demographically during those time periods

2245248 kami minta agar presiden sby mengeluarkan kebijakan khusus terhadap kasus kasus yang melibatkan kepala daerah tidak diijinkan untuk diekspos kepada publik
2245249 permasalahan timbul saat pada penanganan korupsi disambut politisasi yang berujung tendensius serta memperkeruh suasana sehingga menimbulkan ketidakstabilan dan ketidakefektifan pemerintahan di daerah
2245250 sah sah saja kalau media mengekspos kepada publik sepanjang statusnya jelas
2245251 kalau tidak mau diberitakan media karena ada dugaan melakukan penyimpangan dan merugikan dana negara kepala daerah melaksanakan kegiatan pembangunan sesuai koridor hukum yang berlaku di negara ini
2245252 rekomendasi yang ingin memperbaiki citra pemerintah di mata masyarakat itu dapat berbalik menjadi semakin menjatuhkan citra pemerintah
2245253 seharusnya pejabat publik meniru rekan mereka yang memang memiliki prestasi di tingkat lokal maupun nasional dalam memimpin daerah serta pemberantasan korupsi bukan menyalahkan proses penegakan hukum
2245254 konsistensi untuk hanya mencantumkan inisial sepatutnya dilakukan media massa dengan mengedepankan asas praduga tak bersalah
2245255 harusnya pemerintah daerah melalui kepala daerah menjalin kerjasama dengan kpk kepolisian dan kejaksaan dalam rangka menyamakan persepsi terhadap penggunaan keuangan negara
2245256 sebelum kasusnya ditetapkan telah memenuhi syarat untuk diajukan ke pengadilan dan pelakunya ditetapkan sebagai terdakwa hendaknya tidak dipublikasikan komitmen ini perlu dibangun oleh pemerintah bersama kepolisian kejaksaan agung dan kpk
2245257 bisa saja bentuknya berupa inpres atau perpres semuanya kita serahkan kepada presiden
2245258 selama ini para gubernur takut untuk berkreativitas karena khawatir tidak sesuai dengan aturan lantas diperiksa oleh penyidik kemudian diberitakan media massa sehingga roda pembangunan menjadi terhambat dan citra pemerintah daerah semakin memburuk
2245259 saya kira ruang kreativitas kepala daerah harus dibuka memang selama ini ruang itu ada tapi ada ketakutan dari kepala daerah karena akan berurusan dengan hukum sebab mereka dinilai melanggar ketentuan yang berlaku
2245260 sepanjang proporsional dan menerapkan asas praduga tak bersalah pers harus memberitakannya
2245261 kalau hanya mengungkapkan fakta dan data haruslah diberitakan itu hak media sebagai alat kontrol
2245262 tidak benar masyarakat sudah cerdas ada fakta dan berita saya kira masyarakat tidak lantas mengklaim pejabat publik lantas bersalah

2245266 to explore the dynamics of digital reading and writing by examining the rhetorical social cultural political educational and ethical dimensions of digital texts to interrogate issues of technology and literacy and to examine identity including gender race class and more subjectivity and representation in digital spaces
2245267 we thus draw from and strive to extend classical and more modern definitions of rhetoric
2245268 perhaps the most grievous failure of our historiography fueled at least in part by our methodological narrow mindedness has been our reduction of composition history to an agonistic narrative involving two warring factions the villainous current traditionalists and the heroic new rhetoricians or as james berlin calls them transactional rhetoricians
2245269 all this was inspired by the principle which is quite true in itself that in the big lie there is always a certain force of credibility because the broad masses of a nation are always more easily corrupted in the deeper strata of their emotional nature than consciously or voluntarily and thus in the primitive simplicity of their minds they more readily fall victims to the big lie than the small lie since they themselves often tell small lies in little matters but would be ashamed to resort to large scale falsehoods
2245270 nipa wine also known as gigaquit rum is a distilled spirit from the sap of nipa palm the town of gigaquit has a total of 548 28 hectares of nipa land of which at least 500 families earn their

2245360 now that babel is coming to an end the movie is tying in all these stories that we once thought to be completely irrelevant to each other just like when youre writing an essay at the end of the paper the writer wraps up all the points together and the reader is able to see how everything is connected

2245397 la critica de arte sometida a la dictadura de los productores culturales
2245398 el productor cultural neoliberal y los artistas juntos someten al cr tico de arte a los intereses del mercado para atrapar al p blico las secciones y suplementos culturales de los peri dicos y revistas olvidan la creatividad se distancian del p blico y se apagan por lo que el artista se encuentra libre para negociar sus opiniones esta cr tica sin pasi n puede llevar el artista a creer que cualquier cosa es obra de arte la cr tica de arte tiene que ser defendida del mercado y el p blico tiene que ser protegido de la cr tica porque la voz del espectador debe ser escuchada en el mundo global los productores culturales ejercen influencia sobre el gusto individual del p blico sin embargo ellos los productores culturales no se identifican con la cultura local y se ocultan en palabras como curadur a cr tica de arte historia museolog a por otra parte los productores culturales est n aliados y son patrocinados por las grandes instituciones para la producci n de cultura en esas exposiciones espect culo las vedettes son los lienzos consagrados por el mercado internacional del arte
2245399 hay una relaci n perversa contin a magno entre los productores culturales los artistas y los cr ticos de arte porque son los productores los que determinan la agenda de los centros culturales y los cr ticos destinados a escribir los textos propios para el catalogo es decir que los productores culturales hacen propuestas art sticas mediante las obras que han sido creadas por otras personas una vez endiosados los curadores y cr ticos consiguen todo a trav s de fundaciones editoriales instituciones oficiales y para oficiales y de este modo se convierten en dictadores pasando de ser cr ticos de arte a comisarios pol ticos esto ocurre en los medios de comunicaci n de las principales metr polis especializados o no debido a que los editores de cultura mantienen una relaci n endog mica con el mundo del negocio del arte hay una relaci n incestuosa entre los asesores de comunicaci n de los museos y galer as y el mundo de la producci n creaci n de obras de arte la publicidad tiene una penetraci n grande en la producci n del conocimiento y de las artes visuales antiguamente hab a una incompatibilidad tica entre anunciar y escribir un texto de presentaci n para un catalogo pero los centros culturales globalizan no solamente sus exposiciones sino el tedio provocado por las relaciones incestuosas entre coleccionistas e instituciones financieras patrocinadoras los medios de comunicaci n por su parte falsifican las exposiciones ya que no es la obra lo que los medios de comunicaci n nos ofrecen sino una interpretaci n del evento m s que una critica de arte
2245400 el cr tico de arte reclama el autor debe retornar a la obra porque es importante que la opini n del cr tico pueda ser cotejada con la opini n de otro espectador la preocupaci n de los productores culturales es crear estrategias para atraer la mayor cantidad de p blico posible y las estad sticas son m s importantes que el texto cr tico o sea los n meros legitiman la obra de los artistas la p rdida y la ausencia de la cr tica en los medios de comunicaci n es un desastre para la cultura el arte se ha vuelto dependiente de los intereses comerciales y pol ticos debido la pol tica cultural de incentivos a creadores las secciones de cultura de los peri dicos son medios divulgadores y no espacios para reflexi n d nde se ejerce el pensamiento cr tico en la sociedad contempor nea con la ausencia de la cr tica en los peri dicos y revistas no hay interlocuci n entre arte y sociedad dificult ndose la creaci n de un gran arte lo que observamos en las secciones de cultura de los peri dicos y revistas es la repetici n mec nica de ideas y principios y el elogio no especializado ignorante y miedoso

2245467 this is the year mitch mcconnell is the most vulnerable democrats needed to put the best candidate forward and i dont think bruce lunsford is it
2245468 the problems bruce lunsford had are still there but republicans need to have their power checked in congress
2245469 i will vote for the guy and thats the reason
2245470 i dont believe lunsford is as progressive a candidate as we had in greg fischer
2245471 ive talked to bruce lunsford a couple of times and i believe he is a better candidate than mitch mcconnell
2245472 i was somebody who at one point was very opposed to lunsford getting into the race at all
2245473 i had the opportunity to listen to him a few times and i was pleasantly surprised at how informed he was
2245474 i was expecting them to be a bit more hestitant but they are a pragmatic bunch
2245475 even though they werent for him in the primary they are for him now
2245476 its been somewhat quiet this year which is interesting to me because it feels like there is a strong anti incumbent sentiment
2245477 we consider mitch mcconnell to be pretty disastarous for america
2245478 it hasnt been said or brought up among different group heads because of the fact that a lot of them endorsed his opponent in the primary
2245479 hes got more resources than greg fischer i dont know what role we would play
2245480 fischer said some good things about bruce and his supporters have followed
2245481 bruce lunsford has strong support from democrats across the state that are united in a single goal to beat mitch mcconnell
2245482 folks with inside knowledge like lunsford are going to be better advocates for change
2245483 there is a lot of time between now and november
2245484 you cant have a secret ballot and have the ability to count it accurately
2245485 the much needed optional protocol will strengthen access to justice of women on esc rights including the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health art 12 1 icescr education art 13 work art 6 food and freedom from hunger art 11 1 and 11 2 and housing art 11 1 among others the proposed mechanism of individual complaints will allow individuals and groups of individuals to file complaints against their states for failure to uphold their rights under the covenant the views of the committee on these complaints would have a significant impact in furthering womens rights
2245486 undertake steps to achieving progressively the full realization of the rights recognized in the present covenant by all appropriate means including the adoption of legislative measures
2245487 its just unfortunate that there is no delegate from the philippine mission in geneva who is present here to express their support for an optional protocol to the covenant
2245488 we need pressure from ngos stakeholders and policy makers back in the philippines and around the world to support this important process in order to obtain a comprehensive and effective optional protocol
2245489 you will never be able to come back to academics
2245490 to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover she thought i was not unworthy to love her there chiefly i sought thee there only i found thee her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee when it sparkled oer ought that was bright in my story i knew it was love and i felt it was glory

2245492 thinking about starting a diet can be hazardous to your health
2245493 write from the heart you must see through to the heart of things
2245494 sometimes i can be a little slow on the learning curve
2245495 i dont know whether im a white dog with black spots or a black dog with white spots why do people have to be so hung up about black and while cant we just love each other
2245496 berkeley is so liberal i have to have to pass out two hats
2245497 i met him when i was a patient at laguna honda hospital in san francisco in about april of 1987 i think he was introduced to me as tommy roberts he gave me a poem i am fairly certain tha t he was a resident of laguna hondas living area known as clarendon this was or is still for all i know an area for people who were elderly and indigent bet essentially independent or needing very little assistance
2245498 by the standards of society my father was not a success
2245499 he didnt make a lot of money he was labeled as mentally ill he liked to live among people that society pretends do not exist
2245500 old madness has become new meaning because of you my tongue is no longer lead
2245501 einstein once said that one should strive to be not a man of success but a man of value
2245502 the whole man program reinvigorating your body mind and spirit after 40
2245503 after seven years in there he escaped one night after a visit with my uncle
2245504 after that he changed his name and never came back
2245505 he met my mother and they married on her birthday october 5 1934 after a somewhat stormy courtship period
2245506 when all the money ran out they would invite friends and acquaintances to their small apartment and my father would put on a show with readings from shakespeare his own poetry or short stories the price of admission was a can of food
2245507 he has a wonderful impishness a beautiful delightful growth about him he has a suppleness of mind and body a rapt attention as he looks for animals and calls to them
2245508 i feel full confidence in my writing ability i know for certain that someone will buy one of my radio shows i know for certain that i will get a good part in a play last night i dreamt about candy there was more candy than i could eat does it mean ill be rewarded for all my efforts
2245509 your flesh crawls your scalp wrinkles when you look around and see good writers established writers writers with credits a block long unable to sell unable to find work yes its enough to make anyone blanch turn pale and sicken
2245510 my hope and my life stream are both running desperately low so low so stagnant that i hold my breath in fear believing that the dark blank curtain is about to descend
2245511 never able to actualize his potential to flower and flourish
2245512 my father couldnt go back into the arts in new york because people were looking for him after he escaped from what he described as a prison
2245513 he showed up at my college graduation in santa barbara
2245514 it was scary to see him out there and then he disappeared like some dramatic film screen moment
2245515 im waiting for a bus in san francisco to go across the bay to marin county and as im standing there day dreaming thinking about my visit to florida i missed my bus

2245705 friends are good to have around but they can only be with you for maybe a couple of hours every weeks and thats if they are single etc once they get into a relationship the hours are bound to be lower
2245706 yeah lar so why get so worked up over the possibility of losing a friend i mean you can try to work it out with him her but after i did what i perceive to be reasonable its up to her him to decide
2245707 maybe you are being too sensitive i dont know what he she said but i dont put too much stock in what other ppl say p
2245708 yeah lar i mean if you can criticize or talk about other ppl youll have to be big enough to receive criticisms etc
2245709 when i mean you i dont mean you personally i mean ppl in general
2245710 knowing you well means he she has to always tell you things that you like to hear only
2245711 well in that case youll have to analyse and see if what he she said is truth
2245712 and why does it upset you if all she he is doing is tell you what he thinks
2245713 well if you are bold and straight why would you be upset just because he said you are sarcastic
2245714 first of all i dont know what he said secondly i dont know the tone when you talked to him i mean you may sound like you are being sarcastic for all i know
2245715 lol well are you sure you only feel for him as a friend
2245716 but if you only feel that you shouldnt be together with him cuz of the age difference thats just plain silly
2245717 i mean if i were to find a girl younger than me it doesnt mean that im going to be happy with her
2245718 the same goes with if im with a girl older than me it doesnt mean that im not going to be happy with her as well
2245719 so why think about the age difference when perhaps the more important thing you should think about if whether you like him more than just a friend
2245720 it means he feels like you are treating him like a kid sometimes
2245721 and that he wants you to treat him like a mature man someone who is able to carry himself and perhaps take care of you etc
2245722 lol well if you cant get past the age thing nobody can really help you no matter what we tell you the age difference isnt going to be smaller
2245723 so decide for yourself find out wat you really want from him and stick wit that decision
2245724 lol forgive me for saying this but i always laugh when my friends tell me that they are haunted by their past relationships
2245725 in that case tell him once and for all that you can only treat him as your bro and nothing more
2245726 i mean if he cant accept that theres nothing you can do anyway
2245727 but why do you keep saying that ppl always comment that both of you are couples i mean does that mean anything to you
2245728 i mean like whenever i go out with a girl or when a girl sits next to me ppl ask us that if its true illl say yes if its not ill say no but i wouldnt keep thinking about what it means when ppl keep telling me that
2245729 no but from what you tell me he seems interested and you sound like you might be as well if not for the age difference but regardless since you decide that you can only accept him as a bro then stick with it
2245730 huh why does it matter if he pampers you or not
2245731 fine fair enough well for someone who only cares about him as a bro you sure seem to care a lot about what he does or doesnt do for you
2245732 every one has to treat you the same way because of what you perceive them to be p

2245746 my ballet teacher would give lessons to the young princesses elizabeth and margaret during the week then teach us at the weekend
2245747 we went dancing in nightclubs every night and it was such fun that i thought there must be more to life than being a secretary
2245748 then i met a girl who danced with rambert and she told me that at 20 i wasnt too old to become a dancer
2245749 people touched me if they wanted to and each touch and caress was so respectful but then one night a young man stuck his finger up my nose which i thought was horrible but i remained still
2245750 my son became a dancer and was right in the middle of the dance world
2245751 so i was back meeting friends i hadnt seen for years and being asked to do things i became accepted by a different generation and because i was healthy and loved dancing ive continued doing it dancing is good for me it makes me happy
2245752 diana was interested in what this project would do for her mind in terms of stitching it together a bit
2245753 she feels as if shes going a bit batty but arent we all the choreographic methods i use trigger memory and help with areas of cognition which dancers are in touch with because they need to remember combinations
2245754 shes just a very enthused and super charged person with a great deal of effervescence
2245755 and thats why any choreographer at any time would be delighted to have her in their ensemble because its great to have somebody who is a bundle of energy

2245763 i was in abu dsheer neighborhood in southern baghdad an hour ago when my eyes saw something extraordinary
2245764 i just wonder why do they arrest the man who is in charge of keeping peace and order how could they put the criminal on the same level with the policeman or the soldier who was doing his duty who are they to do so
2245765 i didnt say a word when i heard that as the driver is right what will the soldiers and policemen do when they see and hear such a thing if the soldier or a policeman made a mistake his officers or ministry should handle the matter not the americans what respect remains by people for the security forces if something like took place what is the role of the government in such cases eventually i would say what one of the iraqi army officers said to me a week ago

2245768 i was projected to go between the 15th and 25th rounds and milwaukee and pittsburgh showed the most interest leading up to today i saw that pittsburgh was taking a lot of pitchers early once it got to the later rounds my father and i were glued to the computer tracking all their picks
2245769 i realized delaney had a chance to be a prospect during his junior year at the university he learned to attack right center field with his hitting marc scarpa hitting coach worked on having him attack hitting there
2245770 he started to hit the ball to both fields once he realized he could do that there was no way pitchers could pitch to him only one way
2245771 like i said i knew he would get drafted not only can he hit but he is also going to be an outstanding utility player he can play shortstop center field right field 2nd and 3rd base he runs well and also has a strong major league arm
2245772 during his sophomore year he adjusted to college hitters the key was when he decided to work on the inside plate once he established the inside fastball thats when i saw he had a chance to get drafted
2245773 i think the tigers will bring him up as a starter
2245774 gloor is the type of pitcher that can give a team seven innings because of his command of the inside part of the plate

2245813 my stay here is being funded by the pentagon but really its not like i share the pentagons world view
2245814 walaupun aku sebenarnya tidak ingin ikut serta dalam urusan ini tetapi mengingat orang yang berada dibelakang peristiwa ini sangatlah berbahaya terpaksa aku yelu ceng ikut campur tangan niocu bukankah tapi bu kiong cianpwe mengatakan kalau tokoh misterius itu adalah orang dalam istana kaisar malah kemungkinan besar mempunyai kedudukan tinggi apakah tidak berbahaya kalau jit goat siang pokiam dibawa pulang ke istana kaisar
2245815 ah aku yang bodoh ini sebenarnya tak pantas memberi pendapat didepan orang kang ouw yang berjuluk ban su to
2245816 pendapat dari keturunan kwee ceng tayhiap tentu saja berharga untuk didengar katakanlah
2245817 baiklah mengingat tokoh misterius itu kemungkinan besar berada didalam istana kaisar sebaiknya kedua pedang pusaka hendaklah dibawa terpisah kalaupun tokoh misterius itu dapat merebut salah satu pedang yang dibawa ke istana pedang yang lain masih dapat diselamatkan dari tangan tokoh misterius itu menurut pendapatku jika jit pokiam dibawa oleh niocu ke kota raja beiping untuk diserahkan kepada kaisar goat pokiam biarlah tetap berada ditangan bu hiante anggap saja niocu meminjamkannya untuk sementara waktu toh jika niocu ingin mengambilnya kembali tidak sulit untuk mencarinya di bu kee cung lagipula aku percaya bu hiante bukanlah manusia rendah yang ingin mengangkangi pusaka milik orang lain
2245818 aku setuju memang ide yelu sicu cukup baik akupun tadi berpikir untuk memisahkan kedua bilah pedang pusaka ini jika keadaan sudah tenang aku akan menjemput kembali goat pokiam
2245819 baiklah siawte akan menjaga pedang ini dengan sebaik baiknya sampai niocu kembali mengambilnya sekarang siawte mohon diri terlebih dahulu
2245820 dan cayhe juga mohon diri untuk berkelana sambil mencari informasi tentang rencana tokoh misterius itu lagipula cayhe ini termasuk masih baru dan belum berpengalaman didunia kangouw sekalian menimba pengalaman
2245821 baiklah kalau begitu harap kalian hati hati karena bagaimanapun kepandaian dan kelicikan tokoh misterius itu jauh diatas kita bu kiong yang berkepandaian hebat itu saja bisa kalah dalam seratus jurus benar benar musuh yang berbahaya kalau ada informasi menarik harap kalian tidak segan mencariku di kota raja beiping
2245822 tetapi toa siok kalau kita cepat kembali ke bu kee cung mungkin tabib sie pe giok bisa
2245823 sudah kubilang kalau waktuku tinggal sedikit tak perlu kau membantah perkataan terakhirku
2245824 ilmu silat yang hebat benar benar lihay dan sulit dicari tandingannya sayang gerakan yang hebat tidak disertai pengerahan tenaga yang tepat apalagi hang liong sip pat chiang yang gerakannya sederhana kalau tidak disertai tenaga yang cukup tentu berkurang pula kedahsyatannya
2245825 dengan kepandaian seperti ini tidakkah engkau berminat untuk menjadi seorang bu lim beng cu ketua umum dunia persilatan
2245826 hmmm aku tidak punya urusan denganmu lagipula masuk kedaerah pemahkaman keluarga bu adalah terlarang bagi orang luar karena itu aku berhak menghukummu
2245827 sayang sekali kalau kwee ceng sendiri yang menyerangku dengan jurus ini tentu aku terperangkap ditengah badai pusaran tenaga dan sulit untuk mengelak
2245828 hahaha sayangnya aku tak tertarik dengan posisi bu lim beng cu kalau aku mau tentu sudah bertahun tahun yang lalu aku sudah dipanggil beng cu cita citaku lebih tinggi dari hanya sekedar menjadi beng cu
2245829 ya dia bilang keluarga chu tidak pantas menduduki tahta kekaisaran karena chu goan ciang menggunakan tipu muslihat curang untuk mendapatkan tahta sehingga keturunan she chu juga tidak berhak menjadi kaisar
2245830 sayang sekali selama 5 kali bertemu dalam 2 tahun ini satu kalipun dia tidak pernah menyebutkan namanya bahkan 5 kali bertemu tampangnya juga selalu berubah dari tampang kakek kakek orang setengah umuran sampai tampang anak muda dengan suara yang berbeda beda dengan demikian aku juga tidak tahu perkiraan usianya orang itu benar benar luar biasa selain ilmu silatnya sangat tangguh pintar bersiasat dan ahli menyamar pula
2245831 lalu engkau sendiri mengapa menceritakan hal ini kepada kami bukankah kami dapat mengadukan dirimu pada pihak kerajaan dengan tuduhan memberontak
2245832 sebab setelah pertemuan terakhirku dengannya aku baru menyadari betapa berbahaya orang gila berambisi seperti dirinya jika mendapatkan kekuasaan kaisar ditangannya rakyat yang sudah hidup tenang dimasa damai sekarang tentu akan lebih menderita
2245833 pertama kali bertemu dia memintaku untuk menyebarkan desas desus mengenai jit goat siang pokiam aku sendiri tidak tahu ada apa dibalik keistimewaan sepasang pedang pusaka itu tetapi yang pasti pada pertemuan kedua dia mengatakan kalau berita tentang sepasang pusaka itu tentu akan menyebabkan ketidakstabilan dan gejolak di dunia kang ouw bila tiba saatnya aku akan dimintanya maju kedepan mengatasi kekacauan memimpin dunia kang ouw sebagai bu lim beng cu dan membantunya dari belakang dalam merebut tahta hanya saja supaya kekacauan lebih parah dia menyuruh beberapa orang anak buahnya membunuhi beberapa tokoh dunia persilatan tahukah kalian kalau orang yang membunuh wakil ketua siaw lim pai tiong ki taysu bu liang tosu dari bu tong pai dan siang wi siansing dari hoa san pai adalah orang orang suruhannya
2245834 astaga orang gila ini benar benar licik rupanya dia bilang keladi ketegangan hubungan antar perguruan besar kang ouw selama dua tahun ini selama ini tersebar kabar simpang siur kalau semua tokoh partai besar yang tewas itu karena berebut jit goat siang pokiam
2245835 betul hal ini baru kuketahui langsung dari mulut orang itu pada saat itulah aku memutuskan untuk merebut sepasang pedang pusaka supaya bisa kusimpan diam diam hingga keributan berakhir paling tidak aku bisa mencegah terjadinya pertumpahdarahan lebih lanjut
2245836 karena secara tanpa sadar orang itu pernah kelepasan kata kata yang secara tidak langsung menyebutkan kalau dirinya adalah orang dalam istana kaisar bahkan sepertinya menjabat kedudukan penting
2245837 untukmu sendiri aku memberikan tugas berat menjaga nama baik dan keamanan bu kee cung jika semua urusan sudah selesai pelajarilah ilmu tata letak pat kwa dan ilmu lima unsur lalu pergilah ke kompleks pemahkaman luluhur keluarga bu dan gunakan pengetahuan itu untuk menemukan kauw koat pusaka keluarga bu
2245838 aku tahu kalau bakatmu untuk belajar ilmu silat jauh lebih hebat dibandingkan aku hanya saja karena kau suka keluyuran latihan silatmu jadi terbengkalai mulai sekarang kau harus giat melatih kauw koat itu sampai sempurna aku takut orang misterius itu akan mengincar bu kee cung jika tahu aku telah melawan kehendaknya tugasmulah untuk menjaga bu kee cung dimasa depan jangan sampai mengecewakan aku
2245839 hai ji anak hai sejak remaja kau sudah ikut denganku karena ayahmu memintaku untuk mendidikmu ayahmu adalah saudara angkatku sendiri dan aku sendiri setelah sekian lama menikah tidak juga dikaruniai oleh keturunan sehingga aku dan istriku sudah menganggapmu sebagai anak kandung
2245840 hai ji berterima kasih atas segala macam budi dan kasih sayang dari gihu dan gibo ayah dan ibu angkat hai ji sendiri entah bagaimana bisa membalasnya
2245841 ayahmu ma huan adalah seorang penjelajah ulung dan siucay hebat yang menguasai banyak bahasa kalau saja dia tidak terus menerus ikut dalam ekspedisi penjelajahan atas perintah kaisar tentu dia dapat mendidikmu dan saudara saudaramu sendiri namamu sendiri hai berarti laut diberikan karena engkau lahir ketika ayahmu sedang berada diseberang lautan dia adalah patriot sejati yang mengabdi pada negara jadi janganlah kau menyalahkan dia tidak mendidikmu dengan tangannya sendiri
2245842 hai ji sama sekali tidak menyalahkan ayahanda hai ji maklum kalau ayahanda adalah seorang petugas negara yang menghabiskan waktunya lebih banyak diluar dari pada didalam rumah ibu sering sekali menasehati kami bersaudara untuk mengerti keadaan beliau karena itu ketika ayahanda mengantarkan aku ke tempat gihu untuk belajar hai ji benar benar beruntung dapat berada dibawah bimbingan gihu
2245843 suhu haji murad telah mengajarkan semua ilmu yang dimilikinya kepadaku sayang sekali beliau sudah meninggal sebelum aku pulang berlayar aku tidak sempat berbakti kepada beliau sewaktu beliau masih hidup
2245844 nyawa manusia berada ditangan allah kita manusia hanya bisa berusaha tapi allah yang memutuskan segalanya engkau bisa membalas jasanya dengan berbuat kebaikan didunia ini dengan mengamalkan ilmu ajarannya
2245845 aku sengaja tidak ikut serta dalam ekspedisi ke enam laksamana cheng ho khusus untuk menggemblengmu menguasai tingkat ke tujuh dan delapan ilmu pai it thian kun hoat ilmu silat menyembah tuhan yang satu aku benar benar bangga kepadamu dari 9 tingkatan pai it thian kun hoat engkau sudah menguasai tingkat ke delapan dalam usia muda aku sendiri menguasainya setelah melewati usiaku yang ke 40 sampai sekarang karena bakatku yang terbatas tingkat sembilan belum juga bisa ku lewati engkaulah harapanku untuk menembus tingkat akhir yang diciptakan oleh sukong kakek guru untuk menghadapi ilmu para tetua bengkauw
2245846 gihu bukankah gihu pernah bercerita kalau sucouw kakek buyut guru adalah bekas tetua bengkauw persia yang telah mengundurkan diri untuk apa pula beliau menciptakan tingkat delapan pai it thian kun hoat apakah beliau terlibat pertikaian dengan bengkauw setelah mengundurkan diri
2245847 ketahuilah sesungguhnya sucouw mu itu dulunya dikenal di daerah persia sebagai bengkauw sintong anak ajaib dari agama terang yang bernama shiraz sebelum usianya ke 20 beliau sudah mampu menguasai ilmu silat rahasia bengkauw kian kun tay lo ie dan seng hwee leng sampai tingkatan sempurna mungkin yang mampu menyaingi bakat beliau di daratan tionggoan hanyalah bekas ketua bengkauw tionggoan thio bu ki karena ketua bengkauw persia dipilih berdasarkan kepercayaan mereka terhadap dewa api bukan tingkat kepandaian silat dengan sendirinya shiraz sukong kebagian jabatan sebagai penasehat tengah penasehat tengah sendiri adalah jabatan tetua bengkauw persia yang paling tinggi lebih tinggi dari pada penasehat kanan dan penasehat kiri
2245848 ternyata sucouw adalah orang sakti jaman dahulu di tanah persia bagaimana beliau bisa dimusuhi bengkauw sewaktu mengundurkan diri padahal beliau kan seorang tetua yang dihormati sepantasnya bengkauw memperlakukan dengan hormat seorang tetua yang ingin mengundurkan diri
2245849 hal itu terjadi setelah sukong bertemu dengan seorang ulama yang bernama bukhari di kota puhe sekarang bernama bukhara ketika beliau sedang bertualang saat itu sukong meninggalkan kepercayaannya terhadap dewa api bengkauw dan memeluk agama islam sebagai agama barunya ketika kembali ke markas bengkauw sukong merasa posisinya sebagai tiangloo bengkauw sudah tidak sesuai dengan kata hatinya sehingga meminta ijin peengunduran dirinya pada ketua bengkauw saat itu kalau saja sukong bukan seorang tetua bengkauw yang menguasai secara sempurna ilmu rahasia bengkauw tentu tidak akan menjadi masalah tetapi sebagai bekas penasehat tengah bengkauw peristiwa itu menjadi bahan pembicaraan para anggota dan menyebabkan keributan karena keadaan ini sangat berbahaya bagi kelangsungan bengkauw ketua bengkauw saat itu memutuskan mengutus penasehat kanan dan kiri serta sepuluh pelindung bengkauw untuk menghukum mati shiraz sukong walaupun ke dua belas tetua bengkauw mengeroyok sukong seorang tetapi sukong tetap saja dapat mengalahkan dan melukai mereka ketika sukong bermaksud pergi dan ingin bersembunyi karena tidak ingin berseteru dengan bengkauw yang telah banyak memberikan budi baginya 2 penasehat bengkauw mengejek shiraz sukong sebagai orang tak tahu malu karena telah menggunakan ilmu bengkauw untuk mengalahkan orang orang bengkauw
2245850 sukong membalas ejekan mereka dengan mengatakan tidak akan pernah lagi menggunakan kian kun tay lo ie dan seng hwee leng seumur hidupnya dua belas utusan bengkauw tersebut pulang dan melapor kepada ketua bengkauw ketua bengkauw percaya kalau sukong akan memegang kata katanya sejak itu bengkauw tidak pernah lagi mendengar kabar tentang sukong dan berhenti mengejarnya
2245851 apakah sejak itu sucouw mulai menciptakan ilmu pai it thian kun hoat
2245852 sukong menggabungkan seluruh pengetahuannya tentang ilmu silat termasuk ilmu rahasia bengkauw itu untuk menciptakan ilmu baru yang beliau beri nama pai it thian kun hoat untuk menegaskan kalau beliau sungguh sungguh telah memeluk agama baru yang menyembah satu tuhan
2245853 sesungguhnya ilmu silat yang tertera di seng hwee leng merupakan tingkat awal dari kian kun tay lo ie ilmu ini awalnya diciptakan oleh pemimpin kelompok hashashin yang bernama hasan al sabah sebuah kelompok pembunuh politik yang sangat rahasia ilmu ini kemudian dikembangkan hingga ke tingkat yang sempurna oleh ketua bengkauw persia prinsip dasar ilmu ini adalah penguasaan alam sekitar sehingga dengan mudah membolak balik dan memindahkan tenaga lawan sekehendak penguasa ilmu kian kun tay lo ie karena dasar dari kian kun tay lo ie adalah keinginan manusia untuk berkuasa maka sukong menciptakan pi it thian kun hoat berdasarkan prinsip kebalikannya yaitu sabar dan pasrah terhadap tuhan sebagai makhluk manusia kata suhu seng hwee leng dan kian kun tay lo ie adalah ilmu yang sangat berbahaya bagi yang menguasainya secara sempurna karena orang bisa menjadi gila dan akan mati dalam keadaan tersiksa sukong sendiri hampir gila dan mati bunuh diri kalau tidak bertemu dengan ulama bukhari di kota puhe yang membacakan ayat ayat kitab suci al quran untuk menenangkan bathin beliau ketika sedang kerasukan kian kun tay lo ie menurut sukong hasan al sabah menciptakan seng hwee leng khusus bagi anak buahnya yang melakukan misi bunuh diri jika seorang hashashin tertangkap dengan sendirinya dia akan mati karena ilmu seng hwee leng kalau tidak menjadi gila celakanya ilmu ini ditemukan oleh ketua bengkauw persia saat itu dan dikembangkannya menjadi kian kun tay lo ie
2245854 guruku itu adalah murid tunggal shiraz sukong sucouw mu itu melarikan diri dari bengkauw dan berdiam di kota puhe hingga akhir hayatnya
2245855 apakah sekarang gihu juga menginginkan agar aku menyimpan pai it thian kun hoat seperti sukong
2245856 ah tidak perlu pengurus bengkauw persia sekarang sudah berganti tentu mereka tidak akan meneruskan permusuhan yang tidak perlu itu
2245857 hai ji pengalamanmu ikut berlayar denganku selama 3 tahun bersama ekspedisi laksamana cheng ho lebih dari cukup untuk berkelana di dunia kangouw hari ini aku memanggilmu untuk mengutusmu pergi ke kota raja beiping karena aku menerima kabar kalau dikota raja terjadi pembunuhan secara rahasia pangeran pangeran putra dari kaisardinasti beng yong le temuilah ban su to niocu di kotaraja beiping dan berikan surat pengantarku ini padanya
2245858 hendaklah engkau berhati hati selama diperjalanan dan di kotaraja karena saat ini kaisar yong le sedang sakit parah setelah pulang berperang malawan pasukan tartar di gurun gobi setelah beberapa pangeran tewas secara misterius sekarang tinggal 2 orang putra kaisar yang berpeluang besar untuk naik tahta bila kaisar yong le mangkat mereka berdua sedang berebut pengaruh dan merekrut orang orang pandai sebanyak banyaknya termasuk dari dunia kangouw
2245859 yang pertama putra tertua kaisar yong le bernama pangeran chu kaoshi dia ini dekat dengan petinggi sipil istana kaisar sedangkan yang lain adalah pangeran chu kaoshu yang dekat dengan petinggi militer dan jenderal jenderal kerajaan sebisa mungkin janganlah engkau memihak karena sedikit salah langkah sangat berbahaya bagi keluargamu yang tinggal di kota raja
2245860 o iya kau masih ingat bukan ketika 6 tahun yang lalu kita berlayar bersama laksamana cheng ho sewaktu melewati selat malaka aku menyelamatkan seorang penduduk setempat dari keroyokan bajak laut
2245861 tentu saja saat itu orang yang mengaku berasal dari kerajaan pasai memberikan sebuah belati pusaka keluarganya kepada gihu dia bilang nama pusakanya tersebut leng tiong to belati pusat hawa dingin
2245862 hahaha pelafalanmu masih kurang bagus yang benar adalah rencong tapi karena aku akan memberikannya padamu untuk bekal perjalananmu kau boleh menggunakan nama leng tiong apalagi memang belati itu memancarkan hawa dingin sehingga cocok dengan nama yang kau berikan
2245863 sebelum ke kotaraja singgahlah dulu ke kota tiang an untuk menemui kakakku siang lojin yang menjadi imam di mesjid besar tiang an engkau pernah bertemu dengannya dahulu sewaktu dia sedang berkunjung kemari mintalah belati yang kupinjamkan itu kepadanya itu katakan pada beliau kalau belati itu sudah kewariskan kepadamu
2245864 kau boleh pergi sehabis sholat zhuhur kalau kau ingin berpamitan dengan tunanganmu yamila kau pergilah sekarang menemuinya
2245865 engkoh hai kanda hai jika kau pergi kapankah akan kembali kemari kota beiping sangatlah jauh berada di timur aku takut kalau
2245866 yamila moay moay dinda yamila bukankah sudah kuberitahukan kepadamu setelah tugas dari gihu selesai aku akan kembali kemari beserta orang tuaku untuk melamarmu pada ibu dan pamanmu jadi janganlah engkau merasa khawatir
2245867 gihu memberikan tugas padaku karena yakin dengan kemampuanku kalau gihu yang mendidikku saja merasa yakin seharusnya engkaupun tak perlu khawatir
2245868 sudahlah moay moay kalau engkau merasa rindu padaku lihatlah batu giok kemala yang menjadi tanda perjodohan kita doakan keselamatanku pada allah dan yakinlah aku akan kembali secepatnya
2245869 wah kali ini hongsiang baginda kaisar rupanya tidak main main urusan mencari pokiam pedang pusaka menjadi urutan nomor satu padahal aku sudah mengajukan cuti selain cuti dibatalkan juga ditambah tugas khusus mencari pokiam nasib nasib
2245870 padahal semua orang tahu bahwa dunia kangouw sangat berbahaya dan telengas
2245871 mata mata yang kusebar dikota hangciu baru saja melapor kepadaku bahwa para piawsu yang diutus mengirim sepasang pedang pusaka secara diam diam dicegat ditepi sungai tak jauh dari dusun bu kee cung aku datang kesini untuk minta bantuan cianpwe merebut sepasang pedang tersebut dari musuh
2245872 kongcu sepertinya salah alamat meminta bantuanku cayhe adalah petualang yang suka rela ikut dengan laksamana cheng ho tanpa masuk menjadi pegawai kerajaan urusan kerajaan adalah urusan kongcu apalagi kongcu adalah petugas dinas inteljen yang gerak geriknya seharusnya dirahasiakan tidak diceritakan pada orang awam seperti cayhe
2245873 cianpwe terlalu merendah mungkin aku juga tidak akan melihat tinggi temuyun siucay kalau tidak mendengar cerita ban su to niocu sendiri tentang kehebatan ilmu siucay yang dikatakan lebih hebat dari ban su to niocu sendiri ban su to niocu juga saat ini sedang mengejar para pembunuh pawsu tersebut harap cianpwe maklum dan membantu
2245874 hmmmm bagaimanapun aku tidak ingin mengkhianati prinsipku sendiri lagi pula dengan adanya ban su to niocu dipihakmu kongcu tak perlu bantuanku lagi maaf toan kongcu aku sendiri tidak ingin terlbat dengan urusan pemerintahan sekali lagi cayhe minta maaf
2245875 hahaha dasar binarto dari dulu tidak berubah kalau ada mau nya baru kirim arak tiok yap jing dasar dasar
2245876 oooo rupanya kau datang karena urusan madu tawon asmara sayang sekali madu tawon asmara hasil pemberian ban su to niocu simpananku sudah habis buat obat penyakit raja singa para pangeran yang hobi pelesiran satu satunya orang yang masih memiliki madu itu sekarang hanyalah ban su to niocu seorang maafkan aku karena dimana adanya ban su to niocu sendiri aku tidak mengetahuinya mungkin toan kongcu ini bisa membantumu
2245877 hey hey aku sendiri tidak punya penawar racun kenapa harus minta tolong padaku
2245878 hahaha setahu cayhe ban su to niocu walaupun angkuh tetapi bukanlah orang jahat aku yakin beliau pasti mau menolong anak ini
2245879 nanti aku akan memperlihatkan pedang ini pada gan bi to siansing beliaukan sering berpergian ke negeri asing dan banyak melihat hal aneh beliau kemungkinan besar mengenal asal pedang aneh ini
2245880 orang tolol sepertimu mana mengerti ilmu hayati tahukah kau kalau laki laki dan wanita punya hormon yang berbeda walaupun efek sengatan tawon asmara pada laki laki dan wanita sama saja tapi kalau memakannya jelas beda selain kulit belang dan efek mata keranjangmu itu muncul pada kedua jenis kelamin efek lainnya tidak lah sama kalau pada lelaki akan timbul lweekang yang tingginya berlipat pada perempuan justru menjadi obat awet muda aku memakan tawon asmara 25 tahun yang lalu menurutmu bagaimanakah tampangku sekarang
2245881 huh jangan harap kalian mendapatkan tawon asmara dari sekian banyak tawon peliharaanku tawon asmaraku hanya tinggal seekor dan itupun sudah dimakan oleh pemuda tolol itu
2245882 lagi pula kalau makan tawon asmara tanpa penawar tentu akan menghadap giam lo ong dalam waktu 3 bulan kedepan
2245883 siawte sudah memesan resep obat penawar yo bi su dan dalam waktu dekat siawte pasti akan mendapatkan yo bi su itu
2245884 huh memang kalau makan resep obat penawar yo bi su dapat menghilangkan pengaruh racun tawon asmara termasuk lweekang luar biasa yang kau punya tapi apa kau tidak sayang melepas tenaga sakti yang langka itu begitu saja
2245885 apa kau pikir selama 25 tahun kenapa aku masih hidup dan awet muda begini tanpa sebab tertentu
2245886 penyebabnya adalah madu tawon asmara yang dicampur obat penawar yo bi su bisa menghilangkan racun tawon tanpa menghapus lweekang bagi lelaki dan awet muda yang didapat bagi perempuan jika kau mau memberikan goat pokiam kepadaku akan aku serahkan madu tawon asmara yang sudah dicampur dengan obat yo bi su kepadamu bagaimana
2245887 she bu dari bu kee cung bukankah turun temurun cungcu kepala kampung dari bu kee cung adalah keluarga bu keturunan dari siang yang siang liong sepasang naga dari siang yang bu tun ji dan bu siau bun murid kwee ceng tayhiap
2245888 julukan ban su to berpengetahuan selaksa cocok sekali dengan niocu memang keluarga bu kami masih keturunan bu bersaudara murid kwee ceng tayhiap dan cungcu sekarang adalah toa siok paman siawte sendiri paman bu kiong setelah moyang kami bu bersaudara gugur membela kota siang yang keluarga bu kami masih tetap berjuang untuk mengusir bangsa mongol dari tanah tionggoan pada saat bangsa mongol terusir dan dinasti beng berdiri kakek bu berpesan kepada anak keturunannya agar tinggal di bu kee cung tanpa mencampuri urusan politik dan dunia kang ouw
2245889 mencampuri urusan politik dan dunia kang ouw emangnya keluarga bu kalian itu punya kemampuan apa apa itu siang yang siang liong bu bersaudara moyangmu itu tidak lebih dari gentong kosong yang keberatan nama julukan malah memalukan nama besar kwee tayhiap apalagi kalau dibandingkan dengan nama keponakan kwee tayhiap yo ko yang berjuluk sin tiaw tayhiap nama bu bersaudara cuma keroco tak ada artinya
2245890 leluhurku bu bersaudara memang tidak dapat menyaingi kebesaran nama kwe tayhiap dan yo tayhiap tapi paling tidak jiwa patriot mereka tidak kalah dibandingkan chu goan chiang
2245891 teecu sekalian sudah berhasil merampas kedua pusaka dari para piawsu tetapi kemudian dua orang ini merebutnya dari kami
2245892 niocu bukankah bungkusan yang kau pegang itu salah satu dari jit goat pokiam
2245893 kau mengirim murid murid mu untuk merampas barang hantaran yang kumiliki tentu saja kau sudah tahu benda apa yang kupegang sekarang hanya saja aku heran darimana kau mendapat kabar hantaran rahasia ini
2245894 asalkan tidak melawan suhu ku tentu aku akan membalas budi
2245895 kalau tolong buka pakaianmu sedikit saja didaerah dada atau buka sedikit celanamu agar aku bisa melihat pahamu
2245896 kalau kau keberatan bolehlah kau sedikit menari striptise yang seksi saja
2245897 tahukah kau pemuda tolol semakin kau mengumbar nafsu birahimu semakin cepat racun itu membunuhmu bisa jadi sebelum satu bulan kau sudah mampus duluan
2245898 aku juga pernah membunuh orang yang semestinya tidak perlu kubunuh dengan ilmu ini
2245899 wah mungkin karena dibelakangmu ada tung tiang yang mendukung sehingga kau jadi banyak lagak
2245900 lihiap pendekar wanita sungguh lihay hanya dengan sebutir kacang dapat menotok tangan orang dengan sempurna sungguh aku merasa kagum bukan kepalang
2245901 siapa yang kau maksud aku tidak mengerti kenapa engkau harus memberi hormat kepadaku
2245902 hai manis bagaimana kalau kita makan siang bersama setelah itu akan kuantar engkau berpesiar keliling kota
2245903 maaf nona temanku ini memang bersikap kurang sopan harap mengampuninya
2245904 ah lihiap sungguh pendekar yang lihay sekiranya lihiap sudi maukah lihiap berkunjung ke rumah tuan kami untuk dijamu makan ala kadarnya tuan kami sekarang sedang mencari orang pandai yang ingin berbakti bagi nusa dan bangsa untuk direkrut
2245905 aku tak tertarik menjadi anak buah tuanmu itu namun aku tertarik untuk mengetahui siapakah tuanmu itu
2245906 tuanku itu bernama cia tayjin kepala pasukan pengawal kaisar kim ih wi yang terhormat
2245907 hmmmm aku sudah mendengar namanya sejak masuk gerbang kota beiping apakah benar cia tayjin tidak pandai ilmu silat bagaimana bisa dia menjadi seorang pimpinan pengawal kaisar
2245908 cia tayjin adalah seorang ahli strategi perang yang hebat dalam peristiwa jinnan sehingga kaisar yong le sendiri menaruh kepercayaan penuh pada cia tayjin untuk memegang posisi kepala kim ih wi walaupun beliau tidak mengerti ilmu silat akan tetapi wakil beliau di kim ih wi adalah seorang ahli silat kunlun pay yang tangguh
2245909 menarik juga baiklah aku akan berkunjung kerumah tuanmu tapi bukan berarti aku akan mandah saja menjadi anak buah tuanmu itu aku hanya ingin melihat nama besar kim ih wi seperti apa
2245910 cuwi sekalian aku bukanlah cia tayjin melainkan wakilnya di kim ih wi yang biasa dipanggil toan kongcu aku menyambut cuwi sekalian atas nama cia tayjin dan menyampaikan terima kasih atas kunjungan cuwi sekalian kalau boleh kita berkenalan lebih jauh sudikah cuwi sekalian menyebutkan asal dan nama cuwi yang mulia
2245911 supaya uji kepandaian ini lebih menarik silahkan ciok kun locianpwe menguji kang sun hong tayhiap hingga 50 jurus kalau kang tayhiap bisa bertahan berarti kang tayhiap lulus ujian untuk menjadi anggota kim ih wi
2245912 hahahaha baiklah silahkan kang tayhiap masuk kedalam untuk melengkapi dan mengisi dokumen resmi anggota kim ih wi
2245913 lihiap apakah tidak sudi memperlihatkan kepandaian yang dimiliki ataukah it liong ci enghiong yang ingin maju duluan
2245914 aku kemari bukan untuk mencari kedudukan ataupun mencari nama besar aku hanya tertarik mendengar nama besar cia tayjin sejak tadi pagi aku masuk ke kotaraja lagipula untuk uji kepandaian tidak perlu ciok locianpwe menungguku lebih baik toan kongcu sendiri yang maju untuk bermain main pedang sebentar apalagi tentu ciok locianpwe masih merasa lelah setelah bertanding dengan si raja pedang itu
2245915 terserah kongcu tapi kulihat telapak tangan kongcu berkulit agak tebal karena sering berlatih silat dengan senjata ku kira lebih baik kalau kita mengadu kepandaian dengan senjata dan senjata yang sering kupakai adalah pedangku ini
2245916 hahaha mata lihiap sungguh tajam sebagai ahli pedang tentu lihiap cukup terampil untuk memainkan pedang tanpa melukai lawan dalam pibu adu kepandaian baiklah ciok boan loheng harap meminjamkan pedang
2245917 ah penguasaan butong kiam sut ilmu pedang butong yang hebat
2245918 hahaha nona muda yang lihay engkau menguasai butong kiam sut dengan sempurna padahal seluruh anggota butong pay adalah para tosu dan kaum lelaki apalagi dengan memperoleh warisan tay kek kiam sut tentunya engkau adalah orang istimewa di butong pay namaku adalah chu kaoshu benar benar mengagumi kepandaian nona yang lihay sedangkan orang ini adalah ayah angkatku pemilik gedung ini cia tayjin siapakah gerangan nona ini dan bolehkan aku mengetahui nama gurumu yang mulia
2245919 nama hamba in siok lan selain ayahku sendiri bu tong ciangbunjin yang mengajari hamba ilmu silat adalah pamanku sendiri hamba datang ke kotaraja untuk mencari bibiku yang bernama yo siang bwe maafkan kalau hamba telah mengganggu datang kemari
2245920 in liang cinjin adalah butong ciangbunjin yang menggantikan paman gurunya ji lian chu sebagai ciangbunjin butong pay ketiga in liang cinjin sendiri merupakan putra pendekar ke enam butong cit kiam in li heng dan yo put hui anak mendiang menteri yo siauw pembesar pada jaman kaisar hong wu menteri yo siauw sendiri memiliki anak dari selir setelah usianya cukup tua tentunya bibi tirimu ini berusia tak jauh beda dengan dirimu bukankah begitu nona in
2245921 kurang ajar sudah menyerangku gelap gelapan am gi mu malah memutuskan tali pancingku harus kubalas perbuatanmu
2245922 biarlah kubiarkan dulu mereka memegangnya toh dengan jaringan mata mataku mudah untuk menemukan mereka lagi
2245923 hahaha apakah cayhe she yelu atau she chu marga keluarga kaisar beng tentulah tak berguna diketahui oleh ban su to niocu yang mulia
2245924 hmmm bekas ketua kaypang yang terakhir menguasai ta kauw pang hoat adalah yelu chi seorang liao yang menikah dengan kwee hu anak pendekar kwee ceng jika keturunan mereka menikah dengan orang han turun temurun tentu saja turunan mereka tidak bisa berbahasa liao bukan
2245925 hahahaha tak percuma niocu bergelar ban su to terpaksa aku mengaku memang aku bermarga yelu namaku ceng yang berasal dari nama kwee ceng tayhiap
2245926 yelu ceng sicu apakah datang kesini juga karena ingin merebut jit goat siang pokiam
2245927 wah wah niocu menuduh yang bukan bukan senjataku adalah tongkat buat apa aku ikut berebut pedang aku hanya numpang lewat saja sambil melihat keramaian orang orang kang ouw berebut pedang sejak peristiwa perebutan ih thian kiam dan to liong to sudah lama tidak terjadi keramaian seperti sekarang ini hanya saja untuk memilikinya aku tidak tertarik
2245928 hmmmm pedang langit dan golok naga tetap dibiarkan patah oleh kaisar hongwu dan disimpan didalam ruang penyimpanan pusaka kerajaan tanpa pernah ditempa ulang kini malah muncul keributan baru karena dua pedang ini
2245929 pedang ini adalah milik kerajaan karena merupakan hadiah dari kaisar tung yang kok negeri diseberang laut timur sekarang jepang kepada kaisar hongwu pedang pusaka ini adalah buatan empu pembuat pedang tung yang kok terkenal yang bernama okazaki masamune khusus dibuat sebagai hadiah untuk kaisar beng yang mengusir bangsa mongol bunga seruni ukiran ini sendiri adalah lambang kekaisaran tung yang kok dengan demikian adalah hak kaisar beng menyimpannya di istana kaisar sedangkan goat pokiam adalah pusaka istana kaisar sejak jaman dinasti mongol tentu pula setelah penguasa mongol telah terusir goat pokiam tetap dimiliki oleh penguasa istana kaisar sekarang
2245930 ahhh siawte bukan anggota kaypang sedangkan baju robek ini gara gara si hwesio cabul
2245931 keluarga bu dari bu kee cung bukankah keluargamu keturunan bu bersaudara murid kwee ceng tayhiap yang terkenal mempertahankan kota siang yang ilmu silatmu pastilah lihay karena kudengar sepasang pendekar bu mewarisi 18 telapak penakluk naga milik kwee ceng tayhiap selain itu juga mereka mewarisi ilmu andalan it teng taysu yang bernama it yang ci dari ayah mereka bu sam tong yang merupakan murid it teng taysu
2245932 ah sayang sekali kepandaian keluarga bu tidak seperti yang sicu perkirakan
2245933 tidakkah mereka mewariskan kitab yang berisikan teori ilmu secara lengkap dengan demikian kalaupun ada keturunannya yang berbakat akan bisa menguasainya dengan sempurna
2245934 kakekku pernah menceritakan hal ini ketika aku masih kecil beliau pernah bilang kalau bu bersaudara pernah menuliskan kauw koat teori ilmu silat yang diberikan kepada anak mereka sebelum siang yang dikepung oleh pasukan mongol pada pertempuran terakhir entah dimana kauw koat itu sekarang entah jatuh ke tangan pasukan mongol yang menyerbu ataukah masih disimpan oleh leluhur kami ditempat rahasia siapa yang tahu cerita kakekku ini lama kelamaan menjadi mirip legenda atau dongeng saja bagi generasi kami
2245935 hahaha keluarga yelu memang tidak seperti keluarga bu yang patriot membela negara dengan ilmu silatnya kakek moyangku turun temurun lebih suka berdagang atau mempelajari ilmu pengobatan dari pada ilmu silat kakekku dan ayahku sendiri adalah tabib yang lebih suka menolong orang terluka dari pada membuat orang lain terluka walaupun demikian jiwa patriot mereka tidak kalah dengan orang lain kakekku sudah banyak menolong para patriot dan penduduk yang terluka ketika terjadi perang mengusir penjajah mongol begitu juga dengan ayahku yang menolong orang saat perang saudara antara kaisar jianwen dan kaisar yong le kauw koat ta kauw pang hoat dibiarkan menjadi pusaka keluarga tanpa dipelajari isinya sekian lama baru aku yang akhirnya membaca dan mempelajarinya
2245936 kali ini dengan adanya yelu sicu disini siawte percaya penuh dengan niocu marilah cuwi sekalian berkunjung ke rumahku di bu kee cung untuk siawte jamu ala kadarnya di bu kee cung nanti siawte serahkan sendiri pedang pusaka ini dihadapan paman siawte dan yelu sicu sendiri
2245937 hahaha janganlah kau panggil aku dengan panggilan sicu membuatku malu saja panggil aku twako saja eh niocu pemuda ini tidaklah setolol yang kau kira dia tidak akan menyerahkan goat pokiam kepadamu sebelum yakin kalau obat yang kau berikan adalah asli hahaha aku sendiri tertarik untuk pergi ke bu kee cung jelek jelek begini leluhurku masih punya hubungan dengan leluhur keluarga bu
2245938 huh jangan dikira aku takut pada keluarga bu kalian lagi pula aku tidak akan menipu obat ayo kita pergi
2245939 toa siok apa yang terjadi mengapa engkau memakai kedok dan menghadang kami

2245952 anyone with any experience says its not going to be an easy 24 months the overall mood and the reality of food price inflation means that next year will be tougher
2245953 the winter season could be tough and spending money for weekend breaks will come under pressure
2245954 if anything the weekend break is an opportunity people will have shorter breaks and you might see a change in the structure of holidays to wards shorter breaks and long weekends
2245955 people are more price conscious searching for deals and looking for flexibility
2245956 they are saying to themselves ive got 200 where can i go they are not saying i want to go to rome how much will it cost
2245957 we are certainly seeing a great strength in european travellers coming to the us
2245958 there is some weakness in the british market the pounds weakness has affected some of the british travel weve seen there is just less travel outside of britain in general

2245969 thank you lord for giving me the peace of knowing that in spite of my trials and tribulations in spite of the challenges of my illness i can choose to be happy and content with the life you have given me to live thank you amen
2245970 since it is the ministers task to make visible the first vestiges of liberation for others he must bind his own wounds carefully in anticipation of the moment when he will be needed he is called to be the wounded healer the one who must look after his own wounds but at the same time be prepared to heal the wounds of others
2245971 two different letters describe the onset of huntingtons chorea a nerve destroying disease that afflicts 50 percent of the carriers offspring and leads to a slow debilitating death one woman first learned she carried the gene when her 37 year old daughter came down with the disease now her 27 year old son has begun to show the symptoms he is very angry at god she says he knows exactly what will happen to him because for three years he has been watching his sisters health deteriorate another man writes that his brother was just diagnosed with huntingtons which means he has a 50 percent chance so far he has declined to be tested does prayer carry any weight against a defect scripted into the genes at conception
2245972 lying beside dad as he sits in his chair working for breath praying for peace wiping his nose rubbing his shoulders watching mom love dad saying goodbye hearing dad express his love for mom and his love for their life together watching dad gaze heavenward and take his last quiet breath the lord is our shepherd
2245973 in the midst of the mans suffering and their own anguish his family was able to provide the strength and comfort that he needed in order to die gracefully
2245974 lord i ask a simple prayer if its your will let the hd come late in my life so that i can minister to those who are wounded like myself use me to talk about write about not my illness but about your grace and i ask that my family will have the strength and the courage to face whatever may come in the future amen
2245975 the hardships we endure require more than words of course even spiritual words eloquent phrases can not soothe our deep pain but we do find something to lead and guide us through we hear an invitation to allow mourning to become a place of healing and our sadness a way through pain to dancing
2245976 why oh god is this happening to me why me this hurts too much all of sudden life as i know it is over why a part of me is gone why my future without hd is gone why why me
2245977 god i cannot go through with this i cannot go down that road of a long drawn out death i cant do it just let me end my life now
2245978 i dont think i can do this i dont want to do this i dont want my family to suffer through this kill me quickly find a different way
2245979 i know not what the future holds but i know who holds the future

2245981 many of us are tempted to think that if we suffer the only important thing is to be relieved of our pain we want to flee it at all costs
2245982 is being a chaplain for two years going to prepare me for this challenge is being a chaplain automatically giving me that connection to god that i am supposed to have
2245983 turn my mourning into dance finding hope in hard times
2245984 father today i am burying life the way it used to be my former goals and dreams are gone i am not sure what to do but i trust you will show me i place my new life in your hands help me develop a new purpose in what is left in this life so it may not be in vain amen
2245985 naked i came into this world naked i will leave it blessed be the name of the lord
2245986 how i am dealing with the spiritual emotional psychological and physical aspects of having hd
2245987 one of the most insidious aspects of fatalism has to do with how it leads us to resist healing we become hostage to a discouragement that insists that nothing more can be done fatalism reinforces our tenacious grasp on the old we become stubbornly unwilling to consider anything outside our narrow experience fatalism can lead to depression despair even suicide
2245988 dad i know we had lots of plans of going to europe and traveling all over so that you could see all these wonderful architectural wonders and take a stroll in paris hop on a train to london i am so sorry that i couldnt give you that but you know what i believe that one day you and i are going to travel all over this planet and not only this planet i believe well travel all over the universe and see worlds that have never been tainted or damaged by sin and we are going to have a wonderful time doing it you will not have this illness your body will be whole again and youll be jumping up and down out of joy and running back and forth like you 18 again i really believe it
2245989 i was born a catholic and i will die a catholic
2245990 i am so blessed because god has given me another day
2245991 whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven
2245992 the disciples were certainly at this odd with this answer they probably murmured in disappointment they had no rights they were nobodies he probably couldnt even quote the torah he had no ministry skills no education no power no money he probably never fasted or gave alms how could he be great in the kingdom what could a little child possibly know that the disciples didnt know this boy knew that he was not in control of the world every child knows that adults are bigger stronger and smarter children are not in charge of the world and they know it thats their key to heaven
2245993 thank you lord for this day and everything that you gave to me so that i could be strengthened and blessed
2245994 thank you lord for another day of life i leave all things in your hands today and i will not worry about anything that happens
2245995 father i confess that i have not had the kind of faith like of a child i realize that unless my faith is childlike i will not be able to survive this crisis i need that kind of faith please give it to me today and everyday amen
2245996 would not be a very good pentecostal because she couldnt move her arms around
2245997 do not be anxious about anything instead in every situation through prayer and petition with thanksgiving tell your requests to god and the peace of god that surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds in christ jesus
2245998 no effort is too limited or too personal to contribute to the larger strategy
2245999 i cant take it anymore alhamdulillah i arrived here by midnight and i was never happier to see my bed

2246079 12 07 del d a voy pedaleando por la carretera 5 norte y con una sonrisa que no podr a describir voy a 32km h en este momento 33 los camiones los autos los furgones los veh culos varios pasan a mi lado a velocidades inalcanzables pero producidas por m quinas yo con mis humildes 30km h a los que voy 31 ahora me siento genial porque lo estoy consiguiendo yo yo solo desde que sal de mi casa he recorrido 27 6km y estoy en el km 13 de la ruta 5 acabo de verlo en un letrero

2246082 llevo 3hrs con 51 minutos pedaleando no de corrido sino que en total he recorrido 74 3km son las 17 26 en mi reloj y para variar delante m o hay una subida es que argh este camino de mierda est lleno de subidas hace rato me contaron por celu que hubo un temblor yo apenas lo sent y pens que se me hab a pinchado una rueda de nuevo pero no era un temblor ahmmm estoy cansado pero contento adem s ya he subido varias cuestas y las subidas que tenga por delante no me preocupan mayormente porque ya hice las peores del camino ahora donde voy sino me equivoco es una de las partes m s altas pero la inclinaci n es menor y eso eso que uno siente cuando como que se te tapan las orejas lo siento ahora y bastante y como que casi me duele la cabeza mejor voy a seguir pedaleando para llegar pronto a la bajada que tanto quiero llegar y que se yo por ah parar y esperar a que me vengan a encontrar si igual ya falta poco
2246083 hace un ratito pas el km83 de la ruta5 y mi veloc mero marca 97 8km no es menor considerando que es mi primer viaje largo y aparte que voy solo y adem s que he tenido dos pinchazos reconozco que vengo un poquito cansado ya pero no cansad simo como cuando iba en las subidas las cuestas y todo eso pero estoy cansado tengo las piernas como chatas como que me piden por favor camilo un rato para para pero no quiero parar por ac no quiero quedar parado as en la nada a 700m desv aci n a llay llay el salitre y el povenir hace un rato sub la cuesta las chilcas y subirlo igual es pesado pero no tanto como el manzano cuando llegu arriba obviamente la baj fue excelenteee alcanc 56 4km h sin pedalear y la dura que qued extasiado ahora se acab la berma as que corto la transmisi n
2246084 son las 00 22 ya estoy en la casa de la playa llegu resulta que despu s me fui pedaleando harto rato m s hasta que llegu a un area de descanso a 37km de la calera donde me detuve me ba o algo as en el ba o que hay ah recib un llamado de mis tatas que llegaron al rato estadisticas generales 99 9km recorridos velocidad m xima 56 4km h velocidad promedio 19 5km h tiempo total 5 14 49 ac termina la bit cora del capit n camirrakiu hasta la pr xima cambio y fuera
2246085 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2246086 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2246087 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2246088 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2246089 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2246090 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2246091 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2246092 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2246093 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2246094 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2246097 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2246597 margin of safety risk averse value investing strategies for the thoughtful investor
2246598 this book alone will not turn anyone into a successful value investor value investing requires a great deal of hard work unusually strict discipline and a long term investment horizon
2246599 this book is a blueprint that if carefully followed offers a good possibility of investment successes with limited risk
2246600 ability to make long term investment decisions based on business fundamentals
2246601 often inadvertently result in the creation of opportunities for value investors
2246602 the most beneficial time to be a value investor is when the market is falling
2246603 value investors invest with a margin of safety that protects from large losses in declining markets
2246604 mark twain said that there are two times in a mans life when he should not speculate when he cant afford it and when he can
2246605 investors in a stock expect to profit in at least one of three possible ways a from free cash flow generated by the underlying business which will eventually be reflected in a higher share price or distributed as dividends b from an increase in the multiple that investors are willing to pay for the underlying business as reflected in a higher share price c or by narrowing of the gap between share price and underlying business value
2246606 speculators are obsessed with predicting guessing the direction of prices
2246607 value investors pay attention to financial reality in making their investment decisions
2246608 successful investors tend to be unemotional allowing the greed of others to play into their hands by having confidence in their own analysis and judgment they respond to market forces not with blind emotion but with calculated reason
2246609 yet if the security were truly a bargain when it was purchased the rationale course of action would be to take advantage of this even better bargain and buy more
2246610 think for yourself and dont let the market direct you
2246611 security prices sometimes fluctuate not based on any apparent changes in reality but on changes in investor perception
2246612 financial market innovations are good for wall street but bad for clients
2246613 investors must recognize that the early success of an innovation is not a reliable indicator of its ultimate merit
2246614 although the benefits are apparent from the start it takes longer for the problems to surface
2246615 what appears to be new and improved today may prove to be flawed or even fallacious tomorrow
2246616 the eventual market saturation of wall street fads coincides with a cooling of investor enthusiasm when a particular sector is in vogue success is a self fulfilling prophecy as buyers bid up prices they help to justify their original enthusiasm when prices peak and start to decline however the downward movement can also become self fulfilling not only do buyers stop buying they actually become sellers aggravating the oversupply problem that marks the peak of every fad
2246617 it is only fair to note that it is not easy to distinguish an investment fad from a real business trend
2246618 you probably would not choose to dine at a restaurant whose chef always ate elsewhere you should be no more satisfied with a money manager who does not eat his or her own cooking
2246619 an investors time is required both to monitor the current holdings and to investigate potential new investments since most money managers are always looking for additional assets to manage however they spend considerable time meeting with prospective clients in addition to handholding current clientele it is ironic that all clients present and potential would probably be financially better off if none of them spent time with money managers but a free rider problem exists in that each client feels justified in requesting periodic meetings no single meeting places an intolerable burden on a money managers time cumulatively however the hours diverted to marketing can take a toll on investment results
2246620 the largest thrift owners of junk bonds columbia savings and loan centrust savings imperial savings and loan lincoln savings and loan and far west financial were either insolvent of on the brink of insolvency by the end of 1990 most of these institutions had grown rapidly through brokered deposits for the sole purpose of investing the proceeds in junk bonds and other risky assets
2246621 far wests earnings are likely to sink 30 35 in 1980
2246622 one of the recurrent themes of this book is that the future is unpredictable
2246623 the river may overflow its banks only once or twice in a century but you still buy flood insurance
2246624 targeting investment returns leads investors to focus on potential upside rather on downside risk
2246625 rather than targeting a desired rate of return even an eminently reasonable one investors should target risk
2246626 value investing is the discipline of buying securities at a significant discount from their current underlying values and holding them until more of their value is realized the element of the bargain is the key to the process
2246627 the greatest challenge for value investors is maintaining the required discipline being a value investor usually means standing apart from the crowd challenging conventional wisdom and opposing the prevailing investment winds it can be a lonely undertaking a value investor may experience poor even horrendous performance compared with that of other investors or the market as a whole during prolonged periods of market overvaluation
2246628 value investors are students of the game they learn from every pitch those at which they swing and those they let pass by
2246629 for a value investor a pitch must not only be in the strike zone it must be in his
2246630 above all investors must always avoid swinging at bad pitches
2246631 value investing can work very well in an inflationary environment
2246632 investors can not predict when business values will rise or fall valuation should always be performed conservatively giving considerable weight to worst case liquidation value and other methods
2246633 a margin of safety is achieved when securities are purchased at prices sufficiently below underlying value to allow for human error bad luck or extreme volatility in a complex unpredictable and rapidly changing world
2246634 the problem with intangible assets i believe is that they hold little or no margin of safety
2246635 investors should pay attention not only to whether but also to why current holdings are undervalued
2246636 diversify your holdings and hedge when it is financially attractive to do so
2246637 a market downturn is the true test of an investment philosophy
2246638 value investing is in effect predicated on the proposition the efficient market emt hypothesis is frequently wrong
2246639 value investing is simple to understand but difficult to implement
2246640 the trick of successful investors is to sell when they want to not when they have to investors who may need to sell should not own marketable securities other than u s treasury bills
2246641 the most important determinant of whether investors will incur opportunity cost is whether or not part of their portfolios are held in cash
2246642 maintaining moderate cash balances or owning securities that periodically throw off appreciable cash is likely to reduce the number of foregone opportunities
2246643 the primary goal of value investors is to avoid losing money
2246644 npv is the discounted value of all future cash flows that the business is expected to generate
2246645 an irresolvable contradiction exists to perform present value analysis you must predict the future yet the future is reliably predictable
2246646 a discount rate is in effect the rate of interest that would make man investor indifferent between present and future dollars
2246647 depending on the timing and magnitude of the cash flows even modest differences in the discount rate can have a considerable impact on the present value calculation
2246648 investors relying on conservative historical standards of valuation in determining pmv will benefit from a true margin of safety while others margin of safety blows with the financial winds
2246649 at most pmv should be used as one of several inputs in the valuation process and not the exclusive final arbiter of value
2246650 fundamental analysis seeks to establish how underlying values are reflected in stock prices whereas the theory of reflexivity shows how stock prices can influence underlying values
2246651 it is important to remember that the numbers are not an end in themselves rather they are a means to understanding what is really happening in a company
2246652 a bargain should be inspected and re inspected for possible flaws
2246653 high uncertainty is frequently accompanied by low prices by the time uncertainty is resolved prices are likely to have risen
2246654 the motivation of company management can be a very important force in determining the outcome of an investment
2246655 investment research is the process of reducing large piles of information to manageable ones distilling the investment wheat from the chaff there is needless to say a lot of chaff and very little wheat the research process itself like the factory of a manufacturing company produces no profits the profits materialize later often much later when the under valuation identified during the research process is first translated into portfolio decisions and then eventually recognized by the market
2246656 high quality research is not performed on a continuing basis
2246657 when properly implemented troubled company investing may entail less risk than traditional investing yet offer significantly higher returns
2246658 caution is the order of the day for the ordinary investor
2246659 as a rule investors should avoid the common stock of bankrupt entities at virtually any price the risks are great and the returns are very uncertain
2246660 all investors must come to terms with the relentless continuity of the investment process
2246661 when investors do not demand compensation for bearing illiquidity they almost always come to regret it
2246662 investing is in some ways an endless process of managing liquidity
2246663 the tension between earning a high return on the one hand and avoiding risk on the other can run high this is a difficult task
2246664 portfolio management requires paying attention to the portfolio as a whole taking into account diversification possible hedging strategies and the management of portfolio cash flow
2246665 my view is that an investor is better off knowing a lot about a few investments than knowing only a little about each of a great many holdings
2246666 diversification after all is not how many different things you own but how different the things you do own are in the risks they entail
2246667 the single most crucial factor in trading is the developing the appropriate reaction to price fluctuations investors must learn to resist fear the tendency to panic when prices are falling and greed the tendency to become overly enthusiastic when prices are rising
2246668 i recommend that you adopt a value investment philosophy and either find an investment professional with a record of value investment success or commit the requisite time and attention to investing on your own
2246669 the unofficial story of the making of the spice girls
2246670 india must be able to pitch for hosting the olympics in 2020 if not 2016 by that time we much become an economic super power with resources and capacity to stage the worlds greatest sports event
2246671 the only country india can compare with is china everyday i compare our country with china and ask why we cant overtake it when can we overtake china only when we have the resources and the courage to stage the olympics

2246674 it is mostly its the medical feed and electricity to pay for we dont get a cut on electric and to pay for this barn is starting to add up on us a little bit

2246676 the entrenched clerical system of patriarchal power in addition to creating conditions in which the sex abuse scandal could occur has also at times been deeply suspicious of the charism of religious life and where it would lead the church i think of the jesuits and justice of the option of so many womens religious orders for a collegial style of leadership and obedience etc

2246696 a novelist is by nature a person espically good at imitation the emotional devices of others in other words especially good at noticing what people are really thinking and feeling
2246697 it is a fact of life that people are only as
2246698 young people do not realize this because theyre not fully aware that they will die and not only that they themselves will die but their whole civilization everything they love and believe in will die and sooner than they dream
2246699 in this world you simply cannot win no matter how noble you are the best you can hope for is fame and fame eventually dies
2246700 in other words one of the main things beowulf is about is how in this world you simply cannot win no matter how noble you are
2246701 the best you can hope for is fame and the poet undercuts even that in many many ways starting with the poems first line which means literally lo we have found by search the glory of the speardanes in other words fame eventually dies
2246702 i staggered out into the open and up toward the hall with my burden groaning out
2246703 one of the main things beowulf is about is how in this world you simply cannot win no matter how noble you are whatever values we hold dear we must treasure especially because they cannot outlast the planet
2246704 i grew more and more afraid of him and at the same time who can explain it more and more eager for the hour of our meeting
2246705 i was sickened if only at the waste of it all they killed cows horses men they left to rot or burn
2246706 my chest was full of pain my eyes smarted and i was afraid
2246707 a novelist is by nature a person especially good at imitating the emotional devices of others in other words especially good at noticing what people are really thinking and feeling
2246708 the writer is likely to have his own pretty strong opinion but if hes a true artist he doesnt ram it down the readers throat he sets up the alternative possibilities he explores every avenue of the question and he leaves the reader free

2246735 do you believe abortionist henry morgentaler deserves the order of canada
2246736 cleary the waves of offended canadians speaking out have had an impact
2246737 join the growing wave of canadians demanding that the award be revoked
2246738 to express their revulsion at the prospect of presenting such an award to the nations largest and most outspoken abortionist
2246739 it is imperative for us to urge our canadian government leaders to ensure that this act of dishonour against our country and our families is revoked
2246740 we are not surprised as canadian catholics who have seen the poisonous effects of abortion on so many lives to witness now the negative and polarizing effect abortion will continue to have on the order of canada
2246741 unless the decision is reversed this sad legacy will be the continuing stain on your time in office and indeed on the order as a whole
2246742 that in itself is sending a very strong message to the catholic population
2246743 this whole thing has put abortion squarely on the front burner
2246744 they dont want to make a big fuss about it
2246745 i believe that abortion is a great human tragedy for both individual women and all of us as a society
2246746 at the very least the destruction of human life is never something to be celebrated as dr morgentalers award seems to be doing
2246747 you know where i am at and i aint goin nowhere just yet

2246756 away you go i want to examine that ancient gold gaze my fill on those garnered jewels my going will be easier for having seen the treasure
2246757 as god is my witness i would rather my body were robed in the same burning blaze as my body than go back home bearing arms
2246758 far fetched treasures were piled upon him and precious gear i never heard before of a ship so well furbished with battle tackle bladed weapons and coats of mail the massed treasure was loaded on top of him it would travel far out into the oceans sway
2246759 a few miles from here a frost stiffened wood waits and keeps watch above a mere the overhanging bank is a maze of tree roots mirrored in its surface
2246760 and so he mourned as he moved about the world deserted and alone lamenting his unhappiness day and night until deaths flood brimmed up in his heart
2246761 so the geat people his hearth companions sorrowed for the lord who had been laid low they said taht of all thekings upon the earth he was the man most gracious and fair minded kindest to his people and keenest to win fame
2246762 a protector of his people pledged to uphold truth and justice and to respect tradition is entitled to affirm that this man was born to distinction beowulf my friend your fame has gone far and wide in all things you are even tempered prudent and resolute so i stand firm by the promise of friendship we exchanged before forever you will be your peoples mainstay and your won warriors helping hand
2246763 look at this foolish man see how both beowulf and youself are in danger of becoming this way be careful
2246764 saw treasure in abundance but carried no spoils from those quarters except for the head and the inlaid hilt embossed with jewels its blade had melted
2246765 we are glad to bring this booty from the lake it is a token of triumph and we tender it to you
2246766 going will be easier for having seen the treasure a less troubled letting go of the life and lordship i have long maintained
2246767 gracious and fair minded kindest to his people and keenest to win fame
2246768 never once think about the fact that none of it will mean anything when they die
2246769 now war is looming over our nation soon it will be known to franks and frisiansfar ans wide that the king is gone nor do i expect peace or pact keeping of any sort with the swedes
2246770 i give thanks that i behold this treasure here in front of me that i have been allowed to leave my people so well endowed on the day i die
2246771 they sang then and played to please the hero words and music for their warrior prince harp tunes and tales of adventure
2246772 o flowers of warriors beware of that trap choose dear beowulf the better part eternal rewards do not give way to pride
2246773 we have gone through with a glorious endeavor and been much favored in this fight we dared against the unknown nevertheless if you could have seen the monster himself where he lay beaten i would have been better pleased

2246781 youre here long time no see you didnt get fired again did you
2246782 for your information no as a matter of fact im getting promoted the boss just gave me a day off
2246783 but ill spare the details oniichan forbade me to share stories with anyone while were not complete yet
2246784 i dont want oniichan to strain his brain too much
2246785 besides we just played to keep ourselves busy until your brother arrives
2246786 who needs a movie as an excuse to eat popcorn
2246787 oh are you guys done with your game did hikaru lose again
2246788 she didnt get lucky oniichan she got really good but that doesnt mean youre not good either
2246789 i try what i can to keep oniichan out of trouble
2246790 naaaa oniichan you missed seeing yuki beating hikaru at chess countless of times well actually i did too but thats not the point
2246791 i just taught her the basics hikaru besides you better be happy she actually got better at chess i almost lost hope when i was teaching her at times
2246792 everyone i mean almost everyone is here let us therefore begin our meeting
2246793 ill make it sound formal because as you know me i like to make things dramatic life is after all a drama
2246794 and from one crossroads to the other we may encounter bumps along the way and let me tell you it may be a pebble a rock or a boulder but never fail to learn from them sometimes we take things for granted we only realize their importance when theyre already gone
2246795 thank you well then we shall commence being the sensei it gives me the privelege to go first the investments ive previously bought are thankfully doing well and are providing for my needs quite nicely the potentials are behaving well and i see no need to take anyone in at the moment my observations are continuing without a glitch and that by itself is a very good thing
2246796 college is well college its hard but im surviving uh i finally gave up my one job as a student assistant and just focused on the one at the cafe near my house its doing real well and im hoping to reach the managerial staff soon
2246797 dont worry im not but i really am working hard for it so i could move to a better apartment the one i have right now just isnt condusive to studying and yeah thats it
2246798 oh man not this again rub it in will you
2246799 i was in fact invited to the chess club but seeing that im at the bottom of that club while im practically at the top of the skating club i decided to stay with where my gifts are
2246800 are finally convinced that i indeed did not elope with hikaru
2246801 please refrain from calling my parents lord and lady with the underlying meaning of them being dominant and scary guys theyre actually very nice
2246802 but its just well whenever theyre trying to chop off head
2246803 actually no they literally lit up when i mentioned kaji i think that pretty much convinced them plus the fact that i finished high school among the top 25 students of my class
2246804 oh thats cool isnt it so does that mean that hikaru kun can officially visit you at your mansion now that he doesnt have to climb up your balcony just to see you
2246805 if yuki doesnt have anything else to add lets move on kamui
2246806 the competition has been tough but yeah i did and i got into tokyo u too
2246807 sure i was just about to ask you about that
2246808 typical that school is all youre going to report about
2246809 i dont think i have anything that interesting to tell
2246810 i mean im still in high school i havent dropped out im still in the gymnastics club and im likely to be the president next year i think thats it everythings pretty much the same
2246811 well she does have that annoying kid following her all the time
2246812 oh oniichan dont speak about him as if he was a stalker
2246813 besides he isnt following me around he just happens to be in the places where i am and its not like we like each other or anything thatd be like yuck
2246814 of course he wont tell you he likes you and really he just most conveniently happens to be where you are yeah right do you honestly think that i dont know what a guy does just to catch a girls attention
2246815 well i dont see you trying to catch mais attention
2246816 he doesnt need to catch mais attention sara he already has it
2246817 um well im i dont have anything to report really
2246818 didnt you take the entrance exam to tokyo u too
2246819 no way really but you did pass mai i looked for you on the list too
2246820 i think thats it unless you want to include the fact that people still call me aiko
2246821 i dont think youll get out of that mai it comes with being twins
2246822 yes yuki i will seriously i mean what on earth was he thinking leaving like that without a trace without even the slightest bit of warning and before aiko woke up too i always knew hes impatient but come on is one week too long for him to wait
2246823 its hard to know whats going on in his head sometimes
2246824 you cant just kiss someone and then leave them didnt he know how affected aiko was going to be when he left
2246825 listen hikaru not to put you down but theres a lot about kaji that you dont know ok he may look confident even over confident at times but hes got a number of skeletons hidden in his closet hes been through things that you and even i might never know so cut him some slack yeah
2246826 i understand and im sure kaji will also understand your desire to kill him
2246827 i think aikos going to beat you to it though

2246834 its been said and i think its accurate that my husband was obsessed by terrorism in general and al qaida in particular

2246840 many of you are well enough off that president bushs tax cuts may have helped you were saying that for america to get back on track were probably going to cut that short and not give it to you were going to have to take things away from you on behalf of the common good
2246841 why do i have to keep proving to people that i am not a liar
2246842 no matter what you think about the iraq war there is one thing we can all agree on for the next days we have to salute the courage and bravery of those who are risking their lives to vote and those brave iraqi and american soldiers fighting to protect their right to vote
2246843 put this on the ground i left my sunglasses in the limo i need those sunglasses we need to go back
2246844 a right wing network was after his presidency including perverting the constitution
2246845 what are you doing inviting these people into my home these people are our enemies they are trying to destroy us
2246846 i mean youve got a conservative and right wing press presence with really nothing on the other end of the political spectrum
2246847 come on bill put your dick up you cant f k her here
2246848 you know im going to start thanking the woman who cleans the restroom in the building i work in im going to start thinking of her as a

2246850 we are at a stage in history in which remolding society is one of the great challenges facing all of us in the west
2246851 the only way to make a difference is to acquire
2246852 we just cant trust the american people to make those types of choices government has to make those choices for people
2246853 i am a fan of the social policies that you find in europe

2246855 we wanted to make him a character who can handle things beyond his control and stay optimistic
2246856 its very interesting that 30 years later you can bring this character back
2246857 it tells me that theyre really going after 44 plus year olds which would make sense since this is a group with more disposable income
2246858 its hard to say that this is completely true to the real mr bill in the ad mr bill always finds something positive that wasnt true in the original series he just got hurt
2246859 hes a little clay guy who things happen to and hes just fine
2246860 ive been doing everything i can to kill him off for 30 years but he seems to be coming back
2246861 i didnt want mr bill associated with the end of johnnys college fund
2246862 i think its the times like how charlie chaplin flourished in the depression
2246863 having a character stepped on and crumbled was just not funny
2246864 how can it be that mr bill was better informed than mr bush
2246865 the everyday categories with gasoline taking up a larger part of consumers pocketbooks
2246866 the pitch for debit is that it gives consumers control and versatility
2246867 mr bill uses it to buy everyday items and to pay a recurring bill
2246868 if youre using plastic you tend to spend more than when using cash
2246869 zero liability promises on debit cards are only promises theyre not the law
2246870 little else is requisite to carry a state to the highest degree of opulence from the lowest barbarism but peace easy taxes and a tolerable administration of justice all the rest being brought about by the natural course of things
2246871 they that can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety
2246872 any fool can criticize condemn and complain and most fools do
2246873 the state is that great fiction by which everyone tries to live at the expense of everyone else
2246874 when somebody persuades me that i am wrong i change my mind what do you do
2246875 whatever it is that government does sensible americans would prefer that the government do it to someone else this is the idea behind foreign policy

2246879 yes i will acknowledge that mccain loves to sponsor liberal legislation and eschews sponsoring conservative legislation but he does at least support the war in iraq of course he is one of the weakest senators regarding border security and yes he does want to close gitmo and bring enemy combatants into the us court system thereby making it impossible to prosecute their crimes given that doing so would reveal our intelligence methods and of course he is against giving intelligence officers the ability to use non injurious interrogation techniques like water boarding against known terrorist leaders but hey at least he was for the surge along with most of the rest of the senate
2246880 mccain has an acu american conservative union rating of 82 3 clinton has a rating of 9
2246881 thank you jesus for the thunder that is just like a song
2246882 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
2246883 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
2246884 i never think that people die they just go to department stores
2246885 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
2246886 no ones gunna buy the ice cream truck if youre handing out the popsicles for free
2246887 life is a journey time is a river the door is ajar
2246888 life is a journey time is a river the door is ajar
2246889 havent you been listening to a word i just said this is it this what weve been trying to find out for years
2246890 and how are you sure that this is the real thing
2246891 you know that im not usually one to doubt you yuuji
2246892 but do you really expect us to believe that mai sama and kazetenshi aiko are sisters
2246893 so what do you plan to do just go up to mai sama and say hey guess what you have a sister
2246894 of course not if we do that mai sama will just go to youko and ask him whats going on meanwhile the silver haired moron will go to us crush our puny lives and all our efforts will be fruitless
2246895 look i know you want to help the princess but
2246896 you told me once that well tell her the truth once you get the facts straight you dont have the facts straight
2246897 what more evidence do you need these are four accounts written by four roses hidden in four different places in the library none of the writers were in the same lifetime none of them read the others work but they all say the same thing about the history of deathrose youko was the survivor of the overthrown clan not mai sama
2246898 dont call him youko sama in front of me fuu he doesnt deserve that honorific
2246899 hes youkos brother yet he killed every elemental there is now hes the sensei of the stars doesnt that make them the bad guys so why would we want to free mai sama from youko if hes the good one anyway
2246900 just because someones not a member of the bad guys doesnt mean hes good hes the antagonist in his own way i mean youko lied to mai all her life he lied to all of you besides dont you see that hes making us kill people dont you want all this to stop dont you want all this to end fuu
2246901 consider this ran may have killed all the elementals before but according to these accounts it says here that a group of power hungry elementals were the real culprits and that they just used ran to eliminate the other elementals
2246902 well yeah but the point is he hasnt killed anybody since then
2246903 you mean you mean youre siding with blue star yuuji kun
2246904 i guess you can say that maya i dont see anything wrong with what theyre doing from where im standing add the recent discoveries id actually prefer to be a star than a rose
2246905 if the ice maiden wasnt a star thatd be a bonus too
2246906 i cant i promised myself i was going to take mai with me when i do that and i cant take her with me without a good reason
2246907 what are we going to do i mean weve all left the lives we had our families think were dead where are we going to go after this
2246908 we can easily live somewhere else in japan or maybe even in other countries you guys are all intelligent able and resourceful i dont think well have a hard time living back on the ground
2246909 why so soon we barely have time to prepare for it
2246910 i i didnt want to tell you this yet but youko told me to gather all of you in the throne room tonight
2246911 thats the point youkos never gathered all of us there before
2246912 maybe he does heck maybe mai sama already knows the truth too but whatever it is at least were not in the dark we have to be ready for anything
2246913 well roses what do you say i know this is a pretty big decision and believe me i didnt want to rush you into it if you arent with me then i wont leave its all of us or none of us
2246914 i joined deathrose just because i didnt want to die yet but since theres still life even after i leave im in
2246915 i joined because i thought id be fighting the bad guys
2246916 turns out i was actually working for the enemy i thought i was fighting with and i just have to say that im feeling really guilty for almost killing sister count me in
2246917 i guess im in too although i dont think im siding with blue star if youko san was really a good guy then he wouldnt be keeping things from us would he
2246918 i want in i have no reason to stay in deathrose the only reason i could possibly think of is that ill miss this palace
2246919 since you guys all decided to go with this plan then i guess i have no choice
2246920 everyone can you leave us for a while you can start preparing for tonight if you wish
2246921 considering that this could be the last time theyll get to talk id say it might take them a while
2246922 do you think theyll really fix things this time haruna
2246923 although youre mostly silent you were always the opinionated one i find it hard to believe that you wouldnt have your own decision about such a serious thing
2246924 although leaving seems to be the most logical choice all good things have a bad side too
2246925 stop acting like you actually want to know me i am not maya i dont need you to make me feel like im loved because i know im not
2246926 just just just free your princess ride off into the sunset and leave me alone
2246927 i dont act like i want to know you fuu
2246928 they havent im still me youre still you whats the difference
2246929 fuu weve been playing this stupid guessing game for three years id appreciate it if we stopped now
2246930 mai sama is your reason for joining deathrose isnt she
2246931 will you please use the stuff you have in here
2246932 you joined deathrose because of her you stayed in deathrose because of her you promised yourself that you werent going to leave deathrose without her everything you do is because of her why on earth are you grinning
2246933 no i dont and stop smiling the least you could do is pretend like youre not amused with me
2246934 why do i need to pretend i am amused with you
2246935 argh cant you at least hide the fact that you are
2246936 after a pretty frighteningly heart felt talk with one of my friends he suddenly disappears the next day which is the very same day i realize that ive been in love with him for the last two years heck maybe even longer and so i go on thinking that he was dead only to find out a few months later that he was still alive and as an added bonus hes in love with another girl which is the self same girl whos practically his reason for living
2246937 i am not going to calm down cant you see im baring my soul here girls are supposed to be all panicky and talking non stop without pausing to breathe when theyre baring their souls either that or bawl our eyes out take your pick and why are you still smiling
2246938 cant i listen without your face being so close to mine
2246939 she had been six years old and i was 10
2246940 when youko himself told me about this i wanted to kill him i even tried i jumped at him put my cute little 10 year old hands around his neck and seriously attempted to strangle him needless to say i failed i fainted right after i suppose its because of stress imagine that huh a 10 year old suffering from stress when i woke up mai sama was sitting by my bed i hated her the instant she introduced herself to be the deathrose princess i figured that my sister died because of her but then youko told me the truth that she wasnt who she thought she was so i thought that if i could set mai sama free then my being taken wont be in vain my sisters death wont be in vain you were right mai is the reason why i stayed shes the reason why i decided to let youko train me
2246941 and after that if id ever ride off in the sunset itd be with you
2246942 will you please use the stuff you have in here
2246943 i the first time i saw you here in the palace you looked like you didnt want me here
2246944 well to be honest i didnt want you here that time having you here meant that id die of embarrassment
2246945 remember that night before i left for deathrose you laughed in my face when i told you that i liked you
2246946 personally yuuji i dont call asking a girl what would you do if you were forced to be my fianc e as telling her that you liked her
2246947 well what was i supposed to say i didnt know you liked me then too
2246948 the reason i agreed to be a rose yuuji is you and it hasnt changed i go where you go
2246949 me your reason was me i was your unimportant reason gee thanks a lot
2246950 the unimportance doesnt lie with you per se i mean just look at everyones reason for being a rose haruna wanted to live her life to the full and continue doing something for others kaori wanted to help out thinking that she was doing the right thing maya probably just joined because i told her to you joined because you wanted to free mai sama but me i was utterly selfish
2246951 were all selfish in a way fuu we all became roses because we chose to
2246952 yuuji do you really think we can pull this off tonight
2246953 im not sure but im ready to put up a fight if i need to
2246954 though it may be true that some lives dont end the way people want to everyone still has a happy ending everybody deserves one
2246955 would ja let me be honest for one freaking second
2246956 as canadians we were able to play a role in initiating what is truly the modern petroleum age that has shaped our western life for the past 150 years
2246957 theres the drake oil well at the pennsylvania site that claims that and others that say theyre where the modern petroleum age began but we just happened to beat them to it
2246958 most people who do come through the door they say we had no idea what was here that there was even oil in this area
2246959 weve got an industry thats surviving as a cottage industry
2246960 the day may well come that we have to pump those wells and get every last bit of oil out of the ground it may not always be as liberally flowing as it has in the past and the oil has to be coaxed from oil wells of the planet and thats exactly what this system excels at
2246961 three tablespoons for instance is the work of a man for eight hours
2246962 if you look at oil in terms of the energy it has weve devalued it weve cheapened it so that we can commit the kind of folly we do in which we have a 4 000 pound carapace as a car which takes us to buy a quart of milk at the store
2246963 were the bunch that drilled the first well in the middle east for instance six people from petrolia drilled that well on may 26 one oclock in the morning 1908
2246964 oh maybe i should draw a line so you dont eat any of my half
2246965 i keep hearing ashton kutcher say how he was responsible for trucker caps ive heard him make that statement before
2246966 trace and i were wearing them when we were seventeen
2246967 the biggest lie in this preposterous tale that has been told is that my client drove from houston texas to orlando florida nonstop wearing a diaper
2246968 i then asked mrs nowak why she had baby diapers
2246969 mrs nowak said that she didnt want to stop and use the restroom so she used the diapers to collect her urine
2246970 it jeopardizes our ability to have a fair trial when the accused is the butt of jokes
2246971 the question is when to patch what and in what order
2246972 microsoft should have been better prepared with the exchange tool for recalculating and rescheduling appointment dates that are affected by dst i think its very difficult to follow their 25 page outline
2246973 whats not clear to some people is that we provide a lot of documentation of these tools its not a single page
2246974 the second challenge is identifying on each one of those all the different pieces that need to be patched or updated
2246975 not only your operating system but also your applications your custom applications time is such an important element in so many applications from calendaring to bank transaction processing it people are the ones who are going to have a lot of the challenges
2246976 microsoft kept changing the web sites the information the order in which to patch things to the point where absolutely nobody including microsoft had any idea as to what to do
2246977 the steps in which you deploy significant updates may change depending on your scenario
2246978 and it didnt seem to matter who the user was
2246979 there was no rhyme or reason for how it behaved even on the same user the march appointments might not be fixed correctly while the fall appointments were
2246980 to be perfectly honest i am not sure what happened next or if it was fixed it never said download successful or anything like that
2246981 the fact that i still have no idea if the patch worked and what will happen on march 11th is curious to me and i imagine that it may be a rude awakening to many others
2246982 wouldnt you rather be dreaming about something nice back home
2246983 people generally in life will take what you give them
2246984 man i love that bmore shake chune and man tajs club classic is a bonafied killer on the floor and will be played at every rock the bells show this summer
2246985 yall better watch out cause he is fire and people yes hes a white boy

2247052 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
2247053 tell them to look up tell them to remember the stars
2247054 life is a journey time is a river the door is ajar
2247055 this isnt the first time thats happened now is it
2247056 before you remember that youre supposed to be angry at me
2247057 im going to take this chance and apologize i should
2247058 although i still maintain that its dangerous for you to go back there
2247059 i realized that shouting at you wasnt going to help any
2247060 honestly i looked everywhere for you like a madman last night but then whoop dee doo you were here the whole time sleeping like a baby
2247061 i was wondering how you got blood on this though
2247062 i mean the only wound you had was on your arm
2247063 but then who cares what matters is youre safe now right
2247064 im sure youd be more comfortable there than here in oniichans sloppy room wont you
2247065 hikaru shouldnt be here in a while you can still get some rest
2247066 i was just excited to see you ok mai sama
2247067 so i suppose youd like to say that youre walking around
2247068 thats correct besides ive barely gotten out of the room
2247069 well at least its good to know youre back to your old self
2247070 ah yes i m pretty sure kaoris on her way up with your lunch would you like maya to accompany you while you wait
2247071 maya why dont you go downstairs and tell the others that mai sama is having lunch with us
2247072 and you know mai sama i thought i heard dog barks outside my window last night imagine that dog barks of course it was impossible because we dont have dogs around do we i wonder what its like to have a dog dont you think it would be nice mai sama having a dog i mean i bet itd be nice if we had dogs here i had a kitten once but it ran away i dont know why though because i was soooo nice to it wasnt i nice to it fuu chan
2247073 it was a cute little brown kitten i gave it milk everyday but then one day he was just gone he just left just like that
2247074 yes it should taste good since you cooked it for three hours
2247075 oh my mistake i forgot to specify that you cooked it for just a few minutes but you spent more than two hours looking for the vegetables to put in it honestly kaori youre a great cook but you really should remember where you put thi hey
2247076 no throwing anything on this table do it during training
2247077 yes very much its nice to see the girls as they were today
2247078 if i may be so bold where did you go last night
2247079 i only found you being attacked in that alley but that had been a few hours after you left i was wondering where else you went if you dont mind me asking
2247080 hime sama you may be right when you said that we dont tell you much about whats going on but there are just some things that are better left untouched
2247081 things may be unclear right now but since i admittedly know more about you than you do then
2247082 you were expecting we had already reached the third floor am i right
2247083 why dont you go where you were supposed to be going
2247084 yes i was just about to ask you if we will follow our schedule and train this afternoon
2247085 i know you want to train as youve never backed out of an appointment but you dont have to force yourself if youre not up to it
2247086 kazetenshi two toriyama zero man whats gotten in you today
2247087 i was starting to wonder until when youre going to keep that style
2247088 well although you still look pretty that way i still prefer your blue hair and grey eyes
2247089 hey dont get offended ai chan all im saying is i like your original look better
2247090 well being my best friend i just thought youre supposed to approve whatever hair color i have
2247091 i do ai chan i swear its just that well if youve got black hair and brown eyes too it just makes everything confusing
2247092 do not speak of this switch to anyone or else i will have your head ill make it a point that well meet again
2247093 nah i remember you had a collared blouse on after i picked you up from kamuis this morning
2247094 why the sudden interest in my clothes anyway youre not thinking of cross dressing are you
2247095 i was kidding i promise ill never joke about that again
2247096 youre not dead youre just floating between the conscious and the subconscious
2247097 between your conscious and your subconscious and at the same time between yourself and the self that youko developed
2247098 yes thats correct we can see your friends because even though you are physically asleep your senses are still working thus they send the information they get to your mind where we are now
2247099 so the reason you can read my thoughts is precisely because were in my head
2247100 uh huh so if were in my mind then why is it that i dont know who you are
2247101 my name is yume you do not remember me because i am not supposed to be in your memories to begin with i am from youkos memories some of which have been transferred to you when he altered your mind that though was not supposed to happen i suppose he was trying too hard to penetrate your mind
2247102 yes although the real yume does not exist anymore i am her as youko remembered add the information in youkos mind that was also transferred to you plus the information in your mind and viola you have me the yume in your mind that is why i am able to explain these things to you which the real yume would never be able to due to her limited knowledge
2247103 perhaps you can ask ran to explain how brainwashing works and the complications involved perhaps he can present it to you in a more comprehensible fashion i never was able to teach well
2247104 only youko san and i have the ability to use it he said but he never did let me
2247105 ok this shows the ki concentration in the palace to detect foreign presence
2247106 i know its unlikely but i just thought anythings possible and
2247107 he must have planned this from the beginning he captured oniichan so well be forced to come here and fight a brainwashed aiko so that he can duel with ran sama without us getting in the way youko san must be thinking he can change history by killing ran sama at the exact same place of the war its totally logical kamui youre absolutely brilliant
2247108 you dont mean the one where shindou fought against the elementals do you
2247109 ran may have told it as a bedtime story but i knew it aint no fairytale
2247110 ever wondered why the princesre the only ones in the freakin story who dont have no names theres gansei and zai and shindou and yume an everyone else but the princes the main characters dont have any names ever wondered why the storys so long and detailed but there aint no inconsistencies and ran doesnt get anything wrong its because its his story yuki
2247111 well fine if one of the princes then whos the other one
2247112 might we continue this on the way mai did say this is gonna be a long explanation
2247113 yeah oniichan whoopee so does practically every girl in your school
2247114 how come were still here i mean arent we supposed to be watching them still
2247115 perhaps the effect of the roses are completely diminishing now
2247116 wha so the weird things that i was supposed to see thats it
2247117 yes perhaps your resolve on the truth seems to be strong
2247118 but arent i supposed to be waking up if the effect has diminished
2247119 yes that is the way it is supposed to be
2247120 somehow things are happening differently with you but almost everything is different when it comes to you anyway you are different from the rest in more ways than one kazetenshi aiko
2247121 it was attack youko threw it towards us it wasnt fatal
2247122 im not sure why rans not trying to kill youko right now but since he isnt then it gives us no reason to do so
2247123 hikaru keep alert for any second were going to need a distraction
2247124 mai i know this is gonna be hard but im going to need you to focus
2247125 sara you dont have to do this right now rest for a second will you

2247131 im tryina communicate through yer head sara if you can hear me say somethin

2247133 woman i did it without training you can do this i know you can its yer gift sara
2247134 my princess i have to admit youve improved greatly since the last time we sparred
2247135 as a matter of fact i am who do you think taught you everything you know for the last 12 years
2247136 forgive me but i decided to give your newfound friends a break seeing that theyre already terribly tired
2247137 then pray tell me how you reached such a conclusion
2247138 you fought with ran sama this whole time you fought the stars whose level is nowhere near yours yet you have yet to inflict real damage it makes me wonder if you really want to eliminate us at all
2247139 then i suppose im going to have to prove it to you yes
2247140 and our elements cant either but the ground under his feet is there whether youko likes it or not
2247141 well well i wonder what your brother is planning now
2247142 i thought wed already established that nothing can pass through the barrier
2247143 nothing can go in but youko just demonstrated that things can come out
2247144 oh dont be so sad wind angel youll be joining her soon enough
2247145 i think she can still hold out for at least a few more minutes
2247146 hino my sister is walking towards the e n e m y are we seeing the same thing here
2247147 you think that it was your fault for falling for shindous plot for not seeing his plans in motion
2247148 for not being able protecting ran like an older brother should
2247149 you blame yourself for the war so everyday everything you do is simply to provoke ran so that one day he would just kill you but he just wont
2247150 there has to be something we can do to help her
2247151 ran sama cant we do soemthing like a long distance healing or something
2247152 yes but thats objects oniichan i havent tried it on people
2247153 will you please for once stop thinking that you need to sacrifice yourself for everyone
2247154 despite everything that had happened ran still sees you as his brother youko
2247155 i shot the void ran as the wind angel said i m the one whos going to stop this nonsense
2247156 im sorry for being a blind selfish idiot i wasted not only 300 years of my life but of yours as well i should have listened to you and im sorry i know this wont give anybodys life back but im saying sorry anyway
2247157 youre forgiven on behalf of everyone involved im forgiving you
2247158 thank you and i forgive you for being the foolish little brother who never thought about the consequences of your actions and for always getting me into trouble
2247159 ran youre a big kid now i think you can take care of yourself without my help
2247160 i think im going to sleep now try not to go and run into scrapes again yeah
2247161 sometimes we take things for granted we only realize their importance when theyre already gone
2247162 kazetenshi aiko never uses hi but this isnt the first time i used it
2247163 dont worry after tonight i dont think its going to be so confusing anymore
2247164 i thought oh my goodness when i saw you yesterday i thought youko san had killed you i thought i was never going to see you again im so glad youre all right im so glad youre all right
2247165 im trying to get rid of you you filthy witch
2247166 if it wasnt for you she wouldnt have given up being a star
2247167 if it wasnt for you she wouldnt have been killed you killed her
2247168 the evil one the one who tried to kills us which do you think
2247169 yes only nobody knew about it because i was raised as a rose and i thought the stars were the bad people which was disproved when aiko and i met by accident and we decided to unearth the truth about how our mother died so we switched places two weeks ago so that i could investigate ran
2247170 yes but i couldnt bring myself to and aiko stayed here at the palace as she was investigating youko but he found her out so he tortured her and now i think he brainwashed her
2247171 what happens when someone is brainwashed is parts of the persons memories are tweaked or magnified therefore leading forcing rather the person to think a certain way in aikos case youko made her angry at me using what happened to our mother then magnified it and since i think youko has led her to believe that ran killed our mother then i suppose shes angry at everyone connected to blue star
2247172 so shes still our aiko but her perspective has changed
2247173 in a way yes but we are only seeing part of her the brainwashed part of her
2247174 initially the real aiko could still see and feel what is happening outside her body and even though she cannot control it a small part of her still appears in the brainwashed person after a certain period of time depending on the persons willpower she receeds lower until it comes to a point that she does not know whats happening at all it is like she falls asleep i think by now thats whats happening judging from the deviation of her ki if we do not wake her up soon the brainwashers ki will swallow her entirely and the rest of aikos personality totally disappears
2247175 we need to get a reaction from the confined aiko but not just a slight reaction like surprise that can fade after a few seconds it has to be something major youko san told me that the death of a loved one never fails to awaken brainwashed people but of course that is not included in our options
2247176 mostly just cheerful i cant think of anything that we can do that can make her majorly happy right now i dont think chocolatell be enough
2247177 this is way harder than picking out the perfect birthday gift
2247178 were her family and friends for goodness sake im her brother for goodness sake and we cant think of anything thatll get a reaction from her
2247179 yes but at the moment shes angry at us at me for a specific reason we can make the real aiko angry because of something else can you remember any major fights you had with her recently
2247180 if its about making ai chan angry youre the pro
2247181 besides since you have such a quick brain of a genius im sure you can think of something
2247182 well you were but since youre the frontman right now and youre supposed to be thinking of something thatll get aikos reaction i thought i should take the initiative
2247183 i wont accept that you havent come up with anything yet
2247184 shes gonna wanna kill me if i do what ive thought
2247185 ok you got wounded even though you were weilding your ever mighty fire sword
2247186 seeing that i still have the honor of a warrior im going to fight without a weapon as well
2247187 aikos voice echoed through the four corners of the huge throne room
2247188 ai chan its you its really you i was a little doubtful about kajis plan but look it worked it really worked im so glad youre back to your old self
2247189 to make a long explanation short kaji had to kiss you to turn you back to normal
2247190 the two of you still have a lot more explaining to do do you know that
2247191 im really relieved that this problem is solved and all hikaru stop it already but i have to remind you that we still have ran and youko to worry about
2247192 ki roses aiko theyre black roses youko san keeps them in a vase in his office
2247193 youko san might have used those when he brainwashed her
2247194 ai chan you must listen to me the effect of the ki roses must be diminishing its like youll be going to the border between your old self and being controlled by youko san things are going to look strange but you have to remember aiko listen you have to rememember how things really are do you understand
2247195 yes she will it just depends on how strong she clings on to the truth how long shell be out of it it took me a while to wake up because i wasnt so sure of my past but since aikos sure of hers she should be fine and even if it takes her a long time her memories wont be damaged shell have to be treated with the ki roses for years before she can be permanently convinced of something unreal even then she can still be convinced otherwise if you have concrete proof like being faced with a person that she was led to believe to be non existent
2247196 why do you think i believed i was an orphan and that the stars were the ones who killed my parents
2247197 no youre still weak you shouldnt exert yourself too much
2247198 but you should save your strength itd be better if i carried her
2247199 and no hikaru im not gonna get ny ideas you can stop glaring at me now
2247200 they should be fighting right now and even if they were done we should be able to sense where they are
2247201 so what were gonna do old school divide and conquer
2247202 unless you have other ideas of finding them mai you seem to know a lot more than we do
2247203 no i dont think id like to play hide and seek with youko san mai sama
2247204 didnt you say something like that to ai chan before
2247205 she exclaimed whirling around to see a brown haired boy practically rolling in the snow in laughter
2247206 hey ai chan did you know you look like a fish when youre angry
2247207 its all right aiko ill always be here for you ok
2247208 because if it does then that means youre a blue star doesnt it
2247209 im going to kill you as i did your mother
2247210 i did and now im going to kill you too
2247211 it wasnt your fault she died it wasnt your fault it was beyond your control and beyond mine youko killed her not you

2247217 white eagle medicine woman suraj holzwarth is the director and drum keeper of the international grandmother drum peace project she is an international renowned shaman seer and performance artist of seneca and celtic descent her cds include journey of the heart and songlines of the soul she is the director and co producer of the newly released documentary film grandmother drum awakening the global heart she is also the founder and director of the whirling rainbow foundation and the rainbow fire dream institute in palmer
2247218 they specifically didnt like the sale of tickets to a sacred ritual
2247219 a person was caught impersonating a priest or a psychiatrist
2247220 is supposed to allow us the right to determine the usage of our sacred items
2247221 this is about exposing them to native american culture and custom
2247222 all things indian for a good part of my life because they had a human eugenics program in canada until the 1970s where it was considered a good thing to sterilize natives and my grandmother was sure i would be separated from my ovaries on a dentists visit
2247223 class they had no defense against and yet took from our peoples those very things it is not hatred it is simply defending our right to survive to raise our children in their own traditional ways a hope to live in peace and keep our cultural ways
2247224 i have this from a posting on a site i belong to
2247225 what about the people who come from other places and cannot afford to attend helen kanclerz like bernard red cherries due to gas prices and airfair how are they to be addressed
2247226 incested if thats true and needs prison and professional help she has to understand if she changes all this information from senecas to athabascans to lakotas to hopis to jews and scots obviously its a big fat lie and i dont believe the creator would make a big fat liar into an emissary of light creators got a lot of other non lying people to choose from to make into an emissary then theres the part about redirecting your income so the irs cant see how much your 501 c 3 is taking in now that would be cheating and you think the creator applauds that also i might point out that a large number of the photographs
2247227 everything will be fine ill have one of my peace and light
2247228 appreciate her behavior this would be quite well covered michigan penal code chapter xlix indians 750 348 inciting indians sec 348 inciting indians to violate treaty etc any person who shall incite or attempt to incite any indian nation tribe chief or individual to violate any treaty of peace with any other indian nation or tribe or with the united states or to disturb the peace and tranquility existing between any indian nation or tribe and any other indian nation or tribe or the people of the united states or who shall incite or attempt to incite any indian nation tribe chief or individual to violate any law of the united states or of this state shall be guilty of a felony she can add that to her list of possible charges some might think its a stupid law but its on the books and i would say flaunting another cultures sacred items and making a mockery of that culture knowing that this act has caused upset of native americans and other indigenous people in the past and having received many many requests to not do this to the point of bloodshed and doing it anyway would clearly constitute a felony in this case even before she sets foot in the state april 28 2008 at 11 13 pm i think the center of light et al whoever is insisting on having this shindig again in spite of the known issues would probably also be considered a knowing accomplice and be charged as well april 29 2008 at 12 54 pm just so nobody gets excited that law was repealed in 2002 in those words i do believe another was instituted to take its place with better wording not an amendment but a re write as some people may have found the wording inappropriate or not politically correct
2247229 there is no doubt that elders will be present and there is no doubt that this will end up being a lose lose situation for the white folk who take our culture and abuse it we will keep you in mind
2247230 wow i couldnt even get home and the moccasin telegraph was working already

2247232 update for today ms holzwarth since she gets a little over the edge if you call her by her given name was a woman of her word or maybe some of her supporters kept her to it i do not know for sure it was a long day yesterday and a short night last night so my typing may have missed a bit in brief since 4 00am yesterday morning it is now 8 30pm today i have managed 2 hours sleep so forgive me if my typing is worse than last night please we gathered between 9 00 and 9 30 this morning the hosts were all there pictures were taken of our license plates one of the hosts came and was speaking with us trying to get us to leave we told him we were there peacefully and with respect to ensure she was an honorable woman following the agreement she had with us the sheriff was called he came and asked us what was going on we explained the situation and that the fish and wildlife had taken her eagle feathers last night and we only wanted to ascertain that the agreement was being followed he showed great respect for our purpose and asked us to move all our vehicles to one side of the road for safety purposes which we were in the process of doing when a police officer from a neighboring town drove up they had a brief talk and the sheriff came back with him and again asked our purpose we explained we were there peacefully and with no anger but simply assuring our agreement of the previous evening was being met the sheriff informed us that they were told of all things to say about natives i was in shock over this we were protesting against a veteran who had just come home from the war i am positive they saw by our reaction that nothing could be further from the truth as the police left they waved at us realizing we were there in a good way the owner of the property came back and asked two of us to come and walk his land and speak with him this we did we walked and spoke honestly from the heart i felt him to be an honest man who had made a simple mistake in not understanding our protocols he asked us to bless the land which we did this blessing was for the earth and to ask the creator to remove any bad spirits from this place and cause it to be a place of understanding he guaranteed us by his word that the drum would be kept in its trailer we chose not to enter the event at that point not wanting to taint the good that was happening our drum came and sang a song to bring us all good feelings one of our members proceeded to go to the event and see what needed to be seen ms holzwarth was dressed in the same outfit we had seen the night before a white robe covered by a long white coarse woven poncho she had a small hand drum and was using it to sing our member returned and we sang some more we had discussed leaving after a couple more songs and the sheriff returned he had been told more people had arrived wer causing a traffic hazard on a dirt road and came to see he informed us he felt we were doing this in a good way but needed to be sure there were no emotions going to flare our people were well aware of our position here and were all in a peaceful way a tow truck with a motor home and a following car drove by and blew the horns giving our singers a thumbs up a woman drove up and welcomed us she told us if the parking was an issue we could park on her land just down the road she is appalled by the pay to pray concept of this venue so it was a good day
2247233 humble respectful manner taking very good care not to arrogantly overstep
2247234 why does she deny her own past last night i was there she vehemently denied having any caucasian blood
2247235 you do all the wrong things for all the right reasons
2247236 we were not there to abuse her we were there to teach her and help her understand the error of her way
2247237 lost but looking bunch her biggest mistake was using a drummed up pardon the pun heritage using sacred items to cement the fantasy and making herself a non profit rather than just biting the irs bullet and not trying to portray herself as a religious personality
2247238 i am a little bit native but i cant prove it
2247239 no matter what happens its ok to lie as long as your hearts in the right place
2247240 i paid that much money for it its mine and ill do with it as i please

2247255 i love you mommy i love you mommy im really not kidding
2247256 well i dont particularly care much for the mpaa im not particularly affected by them being based in the uk but anyone whos plugged in to the internet cant fail to have heard of them and the tactics that they have employed in supposedly enforcing artists copyright regardless they are still a large well known organization and i was pretty stoked to see that they had chosen my software however when i discovered that they had actually removed all of the back links to my site i was annoyed to say the least anyone whos been following this will know that people removing the back links without permission isnt anything new despite giving this away for free some people still dont think that my work deserves any recognition that a company whose sole reason for being is to enforce copyright protection would then show such blatant disregard for my copyright was understandably galling
2247257 now i know im not exactly renowned for my legalese but i did think that the terms and conditions that i had released forest blog under were pretty solid specifically the section relating to removing the back links you may not remove alter or otherwise disable all or any of the hyperlinks to the host forest website all images links or text must remain unchanged intact and visible when the pages are viewed unless you first obtain explicit written permission from the copyright holders
2247258 should we have decided to make the move to production then we would have paid the twenty five pounds that would have authorized us to run a version of the blog without the logos and links
2247259 from their response they probably went to the lawyers ianal but if it was for testing purposes why did they have it on their public web server instead of an internal development environment or accessible through a vpn i suppose that means that if you download a movie and its for testing purposes only that they wont go after you
2247260 please consider one more public service and seek effs assistance to highlight their hypocrisy while its certainly not your civil duty youd be doing a greater good for the public at large you have been gifted a rare opportunity do you think they would grant to you the same forgiveness youve shown them if they discovered you were in possession of some unauthorized copyrighted work of theirs
2247261 i had never really thought about taking any legal action over the issue until the story started getting coverage on the web and i started getting comments of support on my site and a few emails from various lawyers offering me representation with all of the attention coming in i must say that legal action crossed my mind but after talking to my friends and family i decided against it much to the dismay of many people personally im not a fan of litigation and the culture of suing though i do support it in deserving cases whilst whats happened to me could be considered as a deserving case i think that highlighting their hypocrisy within the mpaa and their actions is more meaningful

2247343 your jog you look like you just came from one
2247344 hey marty may i use this to call a cellphone
2247345 if it isnt the girl who fooled the judges at the tokyo open
2247346 hikaru and i went out on a date last night
2247347 the walk home was pleasant actually it was a new moon so the stars were visible and the wind was cool as well it was quite perfect i must say
2247348 well i just thought id let you in on the news so you know where you stand that date wont be the last you see im sure you know what this means
2247349 i hate seeing a girl crying in front of a boy darling so i took the liberty to tell you this myself at least when karu chan tells you youll be prepared comprende
2247350 yes im sure youd make a really great one youre so good at fabricating stories
2247351 its just a dream mai wake up its just a dream
2247352 for the gazilllionth time this morning mai are you ok
2247353 well i guess im going to have to believe you you dont look too scared anymore
2247354 a few minutes ago you were screaming in your sleep
2247355 my best friend whatre you talking about you are my best friend
2247356 it was just a dream ai chan its not real
2247357 please dont tell me that its a dream because you already said that and you died you died right in front of me
2247358 look at me ai chan im here i am not dead ok do you understand me
2247359 ah were getting somewhere see yes it was in your dream and now youre awake or do you want me to pinch you to prove it
2247360 the room looked like it was a cross between my room on the ground and the one in the palace
2247361 and you and me and oniichan and yuki and kaji attended the same school
2247362 and i couldnt fly and you werent a star and nobody was a star and you called me by my name and you said you didnt know aiko and
2247363 i was talking to you and called you by name but i didnt know aiko hows that possible
2247364 i i dont want to see you die kamui i dont want you to die
2247365 im not going to die ill always be here ok
2247366 how can you be so sure what if my dream was a premonition or something
2247367 we should go on over to his office but if youre not up to it rookie im sure hell understand
2247368 well it wasnt exactly the roses as the rest of you know them it was youko
2247369 dont worry youko assured me that your brother is still alive
2247370 is one of the two remaining people who has the power to permanently kill elementals
2247371 if im not mistaken you had a confrontation with him yesterday correct
2247372 but youre not doing it alone you cant handle it in spite of your being the strongest out of the stars dont even think of protesting kaji
2247373 tonight were all going to go to the roses palace
2247374 kamui in case youve forgotten your sister is a healer
2247375 kaji if you care about kazetenshi aiko you will not object
2247376 honestly i dont want to take all of you with me
2247377 i dont know what waits for us at the deathrose palace youko himself sent an invitation to me to go there tonight thats how i found out that he had taken hikaru i know we dont have enough time to prepare properly but im sure that with common sense teamwork and the will to fight we stand a chance against a waiting enemy am i understood
2247378 yuki go with sara and get yourself healed you have a few hours to rest kaji kamui i suggest you both prepare without attempting to kill each other we will all assemble at the main hall by sundown
2247379 you really worried everyone when you arrived last night you know that
2247380 ah the mans really powerful isnt he well im glad to see that your ki has almost recovered fully im going to heal you a bit more in a few minutes but i want to speak with you first if its all right
2247381 you may already know that im not one to tell someone everything that they want to know instead i tell them what they need to know at that moment there is an opportune time for everything you see when i feel that the time has come for me to reveal something i disclose it without hesitation even so i apologize for being so blunt earlier about your brother
2247382 its all right its best not to sugarcoat it i suppose
2247383 im glad you feel that way that would mean i wont need to apologize for asking a pretty straightforward question now do i
2247384 you were the one who gave that personality altering speech last week didnt you
2247385 i had a hunch was that the first time you encountered the stars
2247386 i met kamui first at a carnival several months ago
2247387 after that i met aiko during the skating open and then she and i accidentally switched places a couple of weeks ago this switch well this one isnt accidental
2247388 i see and have you met your father i heard he was away
2247389 yes hes out of the country he wont arrive till next week
2247390 mai i want you to know that im really relieved to see that youre still ok the last time i saw you you were still a little kid the five of you kamui sara hikaru aiko and yourself were running all over the place rieka once blamed me saying i continuously healed you so you wont run out of energy thus keeping her hands full
2247391 so im guessing that now that youko had attacked you it means you already know his side of the truth correct
2247392 is it really true that you and youko san are both of kurobara that youre brothers
2247393 yes its true though he never acknowledges that ever since he disowned me when our father died he blamed me for the war and for fathers death im sure he told you that
2247394 well in a way i guess it was because of me
2247395 youko didnt tell you zai was our father youve heard of him havent you
2247396 zai was your father but wasnt he the reason for the split
2247397 so the split happened just recently i thought it happened like a hundred years ago or something
2247398 mai maybe you havent noticed but youko and i havent aged a day since we turned 20 or at least i was 20 then that would make him 23 oh no wait twenty four
2247399 thirty decades so that makes you three hundred years old
2247400 around that number yes i suppose so it comes with being a kurobara i still have a choice not to stay young forever though i could still choose to grow old like a normal human being
2247401 remember that i was a rose before it happened the leader of the stars at that time was gansei sama his daughter yume was my friend even when the elements had split into two factions there were still a few rare times when i would see her a rose named shindou saw this and told my father that i was planning to join the stars although it wasnt true that i had decided to switch sides my father was disappointed with me but he was furious at gansei sama accusing him of using his daughter to lure me
2247402 shindou eventually plotted to pit the two leaders against each other upon learning from shindou about yume and myself my father went to confront gansei sama about it but instead of a war erupting the two leaders actually reached a conclusion after a long discussion they decided that they should just let stars and roses mingle if they want to of course shindou wasnt pleased with his followers they stole my fathers ki roses
2247403 when a rose collects a persons seed it turns into a black rose
2247404 those ki roses can be used by an elemental to increase his own power its sort of like healing with enough roses one could have the power of a kurobara maybe even more it can get really really dangerous so my father used to keep the roses inside a vault shindous followers broke into the vault used the roses and took matters into their own hands that was the start of the war
2247405 youko youko has always been protective of me he was the first to know about me and yume actually like our father he thought that gansei sama had used his daughter to get to me so he barged into the star palace and challenged gansei sama to a duel in his own turf
2247406 he was a lot like kaji now that i think about it
2247407 he was still in the middle of hundreds of stars
2247408 i need to clarify this if not to youko then at least to you
2247409 when youko finally got to the battle grounds when he got to where we were everyone and i mean
2247410 when we go there tonight were going to get aiko and oniichan were going to free the roses and well set things straight with youko san right
2247411 i promised you i wasnt going to let you back out on this
2247412 you can see me but i wont be able to see you
2247413 the other day you said just think of the daughter i still have if we dont do this what will become of her that was what you had said and it struck me to the core that was what convinced me
2247414 i sensed it when you did the transfer rieka what if the roses sensed it too what if they come to get you
2247415 hes right beside me megumi hell always be beside me
2247416 hey kaji can i ask you a weird favor can you go the mound right now dont tell anyone youre going ok
2247417 no really thanks its already late and i realized that maybe i dragged you out of bed i didnt want to disturb you its just i just didnt know who else to call
2247418 its just that the phone at kamuis place was busy saras probably having having her usual all night chatting sessions with her friends and kamui isnt answering his cellphone either and oniichan wasnt at home and so was midori
2247419 if you could be something anything what would you be
2247420 so i could watch over the people i the people i wanna watch over
2247421 among the numerous stars in the galaxy there could be two stars that are exactly alike
2247422 tell me something do you know yourself i mean like entirely know yourself inside out do you think you know exactly who you are
2247423 i dont think i know myself entirely i mean i didnt create myself right
2247424 i never considered soulmates to be two people whore exactly the same
2247425 how you can be as brilliant as you are but at the same time totally suck at chess
2247426 you know yuki you shouldnt make a move just to make a move
2247427 i dont make a move just to make a move
2247428 i make a move to eat as much of your pieces as possible isnt that what im supposed to do
2247429 well sort of remember the objective of the game is not to eat your opponents pieces the objective is to catch the king you have to be willing to sacrifice some of your pieces if itll trap your opponent to compromise his king you have to have an endgame yuki not take things move by move
2247430 i didnt know aiko did this when you guys were kids
2247431 then how come she looks like this in this picture
2247432 shes just four years old there yuki she cant wear contacts yet
2247433 oh ok aiko looks cute with a boys cut i wonder why she keeps her hair long
2247434 she always liked her hair long actually i dont remember her ever having a boys cut if it werent for this i wouldnt have believed it myself either
2247435 most people dont remember anything that happened before they turned 5
2247436 i promised dad i was going to clean the attic
2247437 but i havent been training the past days either and rans going to clobber me if i dont show up there today
2247438 please o wonderful beautiful magnificent darling sister of mine whose kindness and compassion is beyond understanding
2247439 my goodness i dont think i can find a man as clich ic if there is such a word
2247440 i was painting a piece requested by one of my most important clients when he went to my studio today
2247441 anyone told that cryptic line would have asked what i did i asked him why he said because im in the presence of the perfect woman now if that wasnt clich ic i dont know what is
2247442 but if you ask me i dont think ill find a man as romantic either oh my goodness i think im blushing just thinking about it
2247443 oh megumis calling me ive got to go ill write about that later i promise i cant not write down what happened
2247444 i im not hungry kaori san you can go on and eat without me
2247445 im all right kaori san maybe i just ate too much at lunch
2247446 i dont have the luxury of time so listen carefully go to the ishiyogi park tonight theres a place there i call the thinking mound its hard to give you directions but we can talk privately there just go to the park and use my ki to find me if you dont show up tonight ill tell the stars and the roses that we switched you wouldnt want that right
2247447 go tonight or our pretty little secret is out go there alone
2247448 how can i trust you when you sent me such a treacherous message
2247449 it was the only way i knew you would do anything just so i wouldnt tell anybody that we switched places for a day
2247450 but you have to know i will get this back in perfect condition else i will have your head
2247451 i also need you to promise me one thing before i let you lay your eyes on it
2247452 keep an open mind and consider the possibilities i didnt come here to fight with you but i did come here to discuss an important matter
2247453 i know that by now youre probably very confused im sorry sometimes i wish i had enough power to permanently erase your memory but i know you might not want that if you knew the whole truth
2247454 do you remember aikos 6th birthday you had promised me that youre going to take care of her no matter what happens i know you were only 7 years old then but i also know that you are a good child and that you love your sister very much so im secure that you will take care of her
2247455 i know that your first encounter with mai would be very disturbing
2247456 yes hikaru mai is aikos twin now that ive told you who mai really is the next logical question to answer is this how did mai get separated from us it happened when she was four
2247457 we were at the beach that day but aiko had a fever so she was left in the hotel with me
2247458 i know it looks like im trying to turn you against deathrose and i understand that your loyalty
2247459 i already know that youre my sister i figured it out last night
2247460 i saw that one in your photo album the other one is mine i figured out that you were my sister and thats totally logical since that explains why we look entirely the same the conclusion i reached though is obviously different from yours i thought
2247461 lets just say for the sake of debate that deathrose is the enemy the bad guys what if we just planted it in your house so you would pity me so we could lure you out here and trust me what if i was going to make myself your weakness and use you to finally destroy blue star
2247462 if that was true then you wouldnt be telling me this
2247463 what if i told you that just so you would eliminate the possibility that i might be lying
2247464 just for the sake of debate if blue star is the enemy then you could be the one being lured into a trap right
2247465 we just didnt want to accept it at once what with us being on opposite sides
2247466 the question now is which side is the side to be on blue star or deathrose
2247467 precisely it looks like we have to figure this out ourselves
2247468 i have a question disregarding what you know about me what do you know about deathrose and blue star
2247469 a pretty self explanatory one if you ask me im just trying to reconcile what i know with what you know so we can straighten this out
2247470 everything like history or whatever you know about us pretend that im just a normal human and i know nothing about blue star and deathrose
2247471 the beginning would be nice up to the present if you can
2247472 one who has the character and capability to handle the elements is what we call a potential and he is given a chance to join the elementals
2247473 blue star is the faction that say that people should be given the choice whether or not to be an elemental they monitor the people if someone shows potential to be an elemental they take him in and train him deathrose on the other hand followed zais ideology they want death to the seed
2247474 i have to warn you the next part is probably the one where youll have the most objections i request you to hear me out for i will listen to you when you get your chance to defend your side
2247475 there were some instances when blue star did more than monitor sometimes they do more than strip a persons seed sometimes they strip the life force of the person when the stars cant keep them under blue star that is what had happened with my parents
2247476 inter marriage between stars and roses was preposterous but one of an elemental and a potential was more welcome even if the potential was an offspring of someone from the other faction as in the case of my father
2247477 there was this man a powerful star that was my mothers friend
2247478 as you said we monitor potentials but thats not our main mission our main mission is to protect people from collection
2247479 i dont know why roses collect all i know is that i dont want to see people getting killed for apparently no reason kaji you know kaji right
2247480 the maroon haired guy whose picture you keep in your closet door
2247481 yes thats him he told me once that its all in a matter of belief that we all have reasons for the things we do i joined blue star initially because it gave me a chance to be with my family again after after minors caused a car accident leading to my death but when i saw the roses try to kill kamui i realized that my view about being a star had changed now i want to protect the people from the minors i know how it feels to lose someone i dont want anybody else experiencing it so i guess thats it all i have is faith and as long as what im doing isnt destructive to anyone then ill keep doing what i do
2247482 its strange hearing that one of your friends actually tried to kill someone
2247483 its weird seeing the roses as they were when we switched
2247484 i suppose there is no way of sugar coating it is there attack kill same banana
2247485 say mai theres something thats been bothering for a while now why do roses collect
2247486 to tell you the truth collection is putting death to the seed at least thats what its supposed to be
2247487 i never saw what collection really is until that night we switched
2247488 i guess to be fair i should read the rest of that right
2247489 ran i assume you already know ran sama and the other stars tried to defeat the roses to get her back
2247490 if you notice all our pictures have only one of your sisters in them we kept only the ones with aiko in them i hid all the pictures we had of mai you know where they are maybe you just havent remembered it yet but dont try too hard to remember you might strain your brain and i
2247491 i love you my son remember that remember that you will never be alone as i am always with you
2247492 that man that had your mother killed what was his name
2247493 irakta saddam rejimi devrildi i ve b lge abd kontrol nde oldu u i in talebiniz red edilmi tir
2247494 its not my fault it was too late when you told me
2247495 im sorry for not paying attention what did you say earlier
2247496 since when do you not comment when the boys throw a comment about any of the girls
2247497 well i just decided to have a personal make over
2247498 youve already taken a bite out of that eat it
2247499 can i have just a plain hotdog without the bread
2247500 you say that as if you dont know us aiko
2247501 nothing so heres my personal make over plan ran sama
2247502 i decided to try to be less assertive but not to the point of being passive i thought maybe id try to be quieter than i was before i think id like to see how it is when im not over reactive ill restrain my violent tendency maybe ill stop myself from commenting on the smallest things instead im just going to keep my opinions to myself unless it was necessary to share my thoughts also thisll probably be the last time ill explain something in a long paragraph unless it was necessary of course because im going to try to be a girl of a few words from now on
2247503 ok ai chan you got our attention whatre you really going to say
2247504 isnt this what they call schizophrenia this is schizophrenia ne oniichan
2247505 that man that man that had your mother killed what was his name
2247506 see thats the thing i cant investigate blue star properly because im biased for them same goes with you and deathrose
2247507 but what if they get suspicious of us were not exactly the same when it comes to our personality not to mention hikaru already knows
2247508 i dont think oniichan found the letter yet if he had he would have hid it somewhere or he would have told me about you as for everybody else were just going to make an excuse in advance first thing this morning we tell them that weve decided to do a personal overhaul this way they wont be suspicious of the overnight attitude change because weve already explained it
2247509 dont treat this as if its not a big deal
2247510 you call toriyama kamui being late for class not a big deal
2247511 as if the worlds going to crash down just because i was late
2247512 but youve never been late before youve never even come close to the first bell you were always way too early
2247513 just because its never happened before doesnt mean its impossible midori
2247514 what do you have to say about all this ai chan
2247515 i woke up a bit late id rather not go into the details why
2247516 but doesnt ishida sensei punish latecomers what was your punishment
2247517 hes to sing in front of the class first thing tomorrow morning
2247518 but then she had a question for me did she not
2247519 kamui why are you so shy to sing anyway dont even attempt to say that you dont have a singing voice because you do
2247520 ishida sensei said she was going to just randomly pick a track from a cd shes going to bring
2247521 according to the group constitution article ii section 5 the term fangirls when addressed to toriyama kamui is authorized to be used only by kazetenshi aiko
2247522 any user of the term aside from the aforementioned authorized user will be subject to
2247523 if you asked me that 10 years ago i wouldve said no
2247524 i expected you to say that really ran holding grudges is bad for the health
2247525 the reason im here is to as you a few questions
2247526 remember that powerful elemental that all the guys wanted to have but never got
2247527 you know ive always wanted to ask you did you
2247528 and i swear you will regret having been born with a tongue
2247529 why did you always push her away ran you couldve had her you had her wrapped around you finger ran you had everyone wrapped around her finger why did you throw it all away
2247530 simply put whereas before you had something i wanted i now have something you want
2247531 does that personal make over thing really include you being hostile towards me
2247532 if this is hostile to you then i wonder what you call the roses
2247533 ever thought that maybe the roses are thinking the same way about us
2247534 i mean this is a war aint it in every war each side thinks theyre the ones who are right
2247535 so were just going to sit back and let this go on arent we going to try and resolve it without violence
2247536 we already tried to talk to the roses but their answer was always a punch or a kick
2247537 yeah it was right before your first fight with the roses dont you remember that
2247538 uh that was that was a year ago already wasnt it
2247539 are you sure your make over thing doesnt include your brain youve been forgetting a whole lotta things lately
2247540 heres the phone oniichan thanks im going out for a while ok
2247541 a friend who wishes to remain anonymous is currently bawling her eyes out
2247542 this is girl talk oniichan i doubt youd want to be there
2247543 just try to avoid shuriken ok just because youre a star doesnt mean its all right to get hurt over and over do you understand me
2247544 hao yes im fine i just wanted to see how you were doing
2247545 fine and dandy everyone bought my make over excuse both fuu and yuuji looked puzzled but they didnt ask anything no one objected youre used to having your way arent you
2247546 most times yeah maa i still cant believe we survived a week and here i thought i was going to get caught on the first day pretending to be you for half a day around three stars was hard enough doing it it amidst all the stars let me just say im amazed with my own guts
2247547 ok so he didnt look scary in the strict sense of the word but he smiles so much i get the feeling that he knows something i dont
2247548 mai of course he knows something you dont thats the whole point of this switch right
2247549 ran isnt scary at all sometimes he acts more like a mascot than a sensei
2247550 maybe you only perceived him to be scary because of the image already formed in your mind
2247551 i guess im going to make a whole lot of effort to forget what youko had told me about ran for a while but really the way he looked at me on my first day almost convinced me that my investigation had ended before it even began
2247552 he looks pretty easy going but theres a deep unknown untouched side of him
2247553 no way youve been there for a week and you havent met him
2247554 the man doesnt show himself yuuji always says that youko doesnt want to be disturbed
2247555 lest you want him to throw daggers at you through his eyes i know yuuji told me that too but i have to ask hes nice to you right
2247556 its just that the way the roses talk about youko gave me the idea that theyre distant from him
2247557 youko san isnt as close to the roses as ran is to the stars but although hes nice to me remember to be extra extra careful with him hes one discerning man but i guess youre already used to keen people arent you
2247558 like kamui for one the first time we switched he was the one with all the questions but i guess thats a good thing because he didnt ask a lot this time sara is of course included in the list
2247559 because she can read minds right youre right about yuki too shes an observer she never pokes around kaji though is another story
2247560 he asks a lot about your past experiences good thing you already told me most of them aiko i think he knows somethings up
2247561 im not trying to poke around i just want to know how you feel about him so id know how to act
2247562 just act normally and youll do fine its not like i act differently towards him
2247563 just a while ago he told me that i was being hostile towards him i know for sure that i wasnt trying to be hostile towards him or anything if hes suspicious aiko ive got to make adjustments tell me how do you act around him
2247564 lets give another subdued applause for toriyama kun who bravely sang the song i randomly picked for him
2247565 are you all right mai sama your hands are cold
2247566 he smiles so much i get the feeling that he knows something i dont
2247567 youve improved a lot hino have you been training behind our backs
2247568 who do you think taught you how to be a star i think youre forgetting which one of us is the teacher and which is the student
2247569 no but i dunno i just find it weird why would she wanna be someone new
2247570 why are you making a big deal out of this anyway
2247571 were back where we started so ai chan wants to change her image let her do it everybody changes anyway right
2247572 what im sayin is she just acts way too different for her to be the same person
2247573 think about it maybe shes that person the roses carried off before yknow the one ran told me about what if she happens to look exactly like aiko and she decides to take her place
2247574 it did maybe maybe like ran sama she hasnt aged a day
2247575 well her ki is a bit different didnt you notice
2247576 would you like me to call the mental hospital now
2247577 sometimes the people you trust are exactly the people who will betray you
2247578 whats that supposed to mean youre not saying ai chan of all people will betray me are you watch it hino thats my best friend youre talking about
2247579 i know full well aikos your best friend ayt look just dont get too close to that girl until i make sure she really is our wind angel
2247580 youre just saying that to separate aiko and i arent you
2247581 the truth is you want aiko for yourself you want me not to trust her
2247582 i may be in love with her but i wont go as far as put a wedge between the two of you do you actually think id stoop so low
2247583 could ya please just stop being biased for one freaking second
2247584 fine i wont deny it im in love with my best friend kazetenshi aiko there happy but if my judgement is impaired because of my feelings for her then doesnt that apply to you too
2247585 forget my name forget my face forget everything you know about me
2247586 ey lk da lar m z usunuz k l gibi keskin olsun tanr t rk kan ta yanlar korusun
2247587 i stubbed my foot painfully on my cabinet and what do i get for it
2247588 yeah yeah its fine lets try that again shall we
2247589 youre making such a big deal out of this its just a word
2247590 no its not just a word kazetenshi aiko is known for always using hao
2247591 kazetenshi aiko never uses hi but this isnt the first time i used it
2247592 why are you referring to yourself in the third and first person in the same sentence
2247593 kamui you do know that sometimes your sister can hear other peoples thoughts without meaning to right
2247594 well she asked me something a few minutes ago and i was thinking that youre the best person to ask about it
2247595 because sara chan said there were several times when she would hear your mind say mai when you were talking at me or something
2247596 well first of all she looked a lot like you
2247597 aiko you were supposed to have dark blue hair and grey eyes but then you dyed you hair and wore contacts making you look exactly like her and you made that personality altering speech thing and you start acting like her so every time i see you i remember mai or at least thats how it was for the first few days i kinda got used to it now
2247598 mai is basically you you with the brown eyes and black hair and that personality thats pretty much un aiko
2247599 i know how much you love your name ai chan what with blue being your favorite color i didnt really mean to give you another name but youre not angry are you
2247600 dont worry after tonight i dont think its going to be so confusing anymore
2247601 meet you in the main hall in a few minutes ok
2247602 remember what yuuji said he said we dont have to divert from a normal meeting for all we know this is just a normal night so dont be nervous ok things are going to be fine
2247603 and what if they dont what if we have to fight
2247604 just because things dont always go as we want them to doesnt mean that its not going to work out in the end
2247605 i guess youre right i wish i can be as calm as you are
2247606 it took you long enough to finally use your arrow kaori san
2247607 what youre seeing right now whatever youre hearing right now trust me its going to get worse
2247608 the battle has just begun sara whoevers screaming shes not going to be the only one there will be more and you have to be able to handle it you have to bear it do you understand me can you do that
2247609 the sooner we get there the sooner this is going to stop do you understand me
2247610 but i have to know can you handle this because if you cant im going to have to send you back
2247611 well that was a really clever use of her last remaining energy what a way to go kaori i must say you taught her well yuuji
2247612 for a minor there isnt supposed to be anything more important than collecting or taking a star down
2247613 go with yuki and see if shes right dont take too long if you see nothing dont go digging understand
2247614 i cant imagine what they would be guarding in there though
2247615 i cant either but i guess theres only one way to find out
2247616 thatll have to do for now aiko use wind and carry him upstairs well try to wake him there we cant afford getting locked down here too
2247617 well it seems like they didnt think wed find him
2247618 i think so where are we are you guys alone
2247619 were in the deathrose palace ran sama and the others went ahead to look for youko
2247620 is that supposed to weaken my defense in any way yuuji
2247621 thats why he didnt move when i attacked him cmon haruna
2247622 and will my sister be able to live again as well
2247623 this is how its going to be either my sister comes with me or i go with her
2247624 sorry but the hiroguchi sisters come as one package you cant have one without the other
2247625 thats what i like about you fuu san straighforward with spunk
2247626 sir maybe you havent noticed but i am dead i dont exactly have anything to lose
2247627 very good fuu san very good you love your sister very much dont you
2247628 i already lost the man i love im not going to lose maya too
2247629 tsk tragic it is when a woman sacrifices her life for a man
2247630 more tragic it is when the man wouldve been better off dead
2247631 its pointless to use your element on me yuuji i gave that to you therefore i can control it
2247632 shaping the network society documents and analyzes the emergence of civil society in cyberspace based on contributions by some of the best experts in the world it is essential reading for students and practitioners of the new forms of democracy in the information age
2247633 doug schuler and peter day have done it again this book challenges us to ensure that the benefits of a network society flow to all not just the rich or well educated activists educators academics students and citizens alike will all find inspiration here
2247634 this book adds two important concerns to an urgent agenda for research and action in the field of network technologies how can we raise the profile of social responsibility in a field dominated by business interests and how can we make this a genuinely international project rather than one dominated by nation specific interests

2247645 no shit roger our leaders are like you they were educated at good schools they have plenty of money they live in washington dc and are obsessed with dc society minutiae they attend cocktail parties with tim russert and maureen orth

2247648 all i can tell you is that he was claimed but nothing came to fruition
2247649 is it wrong to visit the library every now and then
2247650 and hes always always there whenever i have to work its so frustrating fuu chan why do i always have to fight him he fights so unfairly you know
2247651 he makes everything so dark its so unfair that know it all swishing his bokken at me the whole time im starting to really really not like him
2247652 and tonight did you see what he did he demanded i tell him where his sister went how was i supposed to know where the wind angel was fuu chan im not her keeper besides i hadnt seen the angel for several months now what do you think fuu chan do you think shes missing
2247653 why are you prowling around like a thief princess arent you too old to be playing hide and seek
2247654 well then mai sama i have a surprise for you wont you come with me
2247655 i never took you here before have i mai sama
2247656 in a way yes this is the prison several storeys below ground level the palaces ground level this is where we kept elementals who couldnt control their seed
2247657 yes since we started collecting the seed we didnt have a need for this place until today
2247658 i dont know how it happened but the palace had been infiltrated by an enemy
2247659 this is a blue star mai sama her name is kazetenshi aiko
2247660 as you can see she has taken on your image
2247661 so she can pass herself off as your highness without anyone being suspicious and given the speech you gave last week no one suspected her until i found her this afternoon oddly her ki is uncanningly close to yours as well
2247662 what im wondering is how she managed to walk around the palace without bumping into you
2247663 if you had gone out of the palace again today
2247664 well just get rid of her we have no use for her here
2247665 i didnt tell you to torture her i meant get rid of her as in take her out of the palace
2247666 this is taking her out of the palace mai sama
2247667 turning against your own sensei for this star mai sama
2247668 i gave you an order youko and you disobeyed it
2247669 i am your princess and as such i have authority over you despite the fact that you are my adviser you are just my adviser i have the final decision and you are to follow it
2247670 why so shocked mai i thought you already knew seeing that you collaborated with the stars already though i must say youre a very good actress if i didnt know what was going on you couldve fooled me
2247671 you were a means to an end you should be grateful you had a purpose for living
2247672 no mai it wasnt sixteen years it was twelve i only had you under my care when you were four and this is real mai sama the life you thought you knew that wasnt real im not the one brainwashed and neither was kazetenshi aiko it was you kazetenshi mai
2247673 there are some things we are not meant to understand mai
2247674 you had the wrong reason to be scared of him mai he didnt kill your father your fathers alive as he still lives with your brother and twin and he didnt kill your mother either
2247675 im offended mai sama do you not think im a powerful elemental im a kurobara mai i have the power to kill any elemental if i wish to like you rieka was a means to get to ran the reason why i took you was so she would give up her being a star which she did so that i could kill her which i did
2247676 perhaps after he blindly lashed out perhaps he suddenly realized exactly what he did perhaps he felt guilty and decided to spare me to tell you the truth i would have preferred it if he killed me as well you may know how hard it is to grow up without your family but at least you had friends at least you had the roses didnt you mai as for me i had no one do you know how hard that is mai i had to live in this empty palace by myself even for a grown man that could get pretty depressing no man is an island so they say
2247677 but if the kurobara clan had been the strongest then how did ran defeat you
2247678 simple ran was a kurobara himself he was my brother
2247679 now that historys out of the way lets get to the next part of the programme shall we
2247680 you actually think i shouldnt be worried about this would you just look what you did to the dojo what on earth has gotten into your brains
2247681 spars dont last this long kaji and they dont involve stars lashing out at their teammates with their best attacks at full force and what were you two doing not even planning to avoid an assault do you realize what could have happened if we hadnt arrived do you realize you couldve died without that force field around you
2247682 stars dont die yes thank you i know that kamui but you couldve gotten seriously hurt dont even begin to think of saying that i can heal you anyway because judging from the intensity of your attacks i doubt i can heal you both in one day and what if there was an attack hm whos going to defend
2247683 that is not the point hino argh honestly you two i expected both of you to be more sensible than this
2247684 i wasnt decided i was freaking asking you to help me make sure toriyam aaaah
2247685 youve caused enough trouble for one day both of you aiya
2247686 kaji take her to her room as fast as you can open the window and make sure the air is circulating and that she can breathe easily do not leave her alone kamui get your sister and yuki go look for hikaru come back as soon as possible
2247687 you never liked research in high school whenever we had a reading assignment you always asked me if i wanted a group study and what always happens is i end up reading the whole thing and just reiterating it to you
2247688 you were a pretty diligent student always ready for quizzes and exams but when it came to long reading assignments and research you take on the attitude of a juvenile delinquent
2247689 yes it was that bad that was just three years ago matsuo i cant believe you already forgot about that
2247690 it was three years ago hiroguchi i cant believe you still remember that
2247691 yes well high school is one of the most exciting stages of life so they say its pretty hard to forget
2247692 i never did find out if i passed tokyo u
2247693 i checked the results the day it was out you passed
2247694 everyone expected it you were the only who thought that you werent going to pass
2247695 mom mustve been jumping around with joy that her prediction came true
2247696 of course your mom didnt jump around with joy yuuji why on earth would you think that
2247697 the the results came out the day after you disappeared yuuji no one really bothered to see if you passed or not because they were too busy being shocked that you were gone no one cared if you made it if you were dead anyway it was pointless to look for your name on the list

2247804 i have a few but i dont have enough it also drops because were back in points so we need to keep working on where we are in the points and try to gain another few positions we have to focus on doing all that we can to get more bonus points that will be pretty big heading into the chase
2247805 its been nice the gillett family has done a great job doing things to make our teams better we still have a long ways to go but weve made some good progress real quickly im looking forward to the future with them
2247806 it was really important the best way for us to make the chase is to remain consistent with our racecar each and every race its a tough battle right now for us to come out of pocono and gain two positions in the chase is a credit to kenny francis and all the guys that work on this budweiser dodge theres still a lot of racing left but last weekend was a good day for gillett evernham and all the guys that work on our team

2247812 it has been an eventful week with a lot of rumors and a lot of things that people come up with and i have no idea where its coming from
2247813 this defines where we are at and i am really excited about the opportunity that these guys gave me six years ago
2247814 we felt like we had a deal a long time ago with tony with a handshake the test was just trying to get it on paper tony is what we consider a franchise player and one of the foundations of the team hes part of the family
2247815 tony gave us our first pole our first win and our first championship and thats the kind of relationship that weve had
2247816 you know like so many families once in a while we have our squabbles sometimes they get pretty loud but i promise you that guy sitting up here theres nobody more motivated in the sport
2247817 theres still a few things to iron out but hes going to be here next year
2247818 now we can concentrate on finishing out this season strong and getting ready for next year
2247819 we thought we should have at least three of the four as championship contenders
2247820 weve been very competitive at almost every racetrack and thats probably the most frustrating thing weve been in the position to win quite a few races but either an incident on the racetrack has taken us out or driver error or in fairness some bad strategy on our part
2247821 i had a little meeting with them after the last race and i think we all are pretty much on the same page
2247822 there is no no 1 driver what has made this team work i think is that there isnt that its the four working together have we had that all year this year no has there had to be some reminders yes

2247832 in our world in which the generation of new knowledge and its application to change the human condition is the engine which moves human society further away from barbarism do we not have need to recall africas hundreds of thousands of intellectuals back from their places of emigration in western europe and north america to rejoin those who remain still within our shores i dream of the day when these the african mathematicians and computer specialists in washington and new york the african physicists engineers doctors business managers and economists will return from london and manchester and paris and brussels to add to the african pool of brain power to enquire into and find solutions to africas problems and challenges to open the african door to the world of knowledge to elevate africas place within the universe of research the information of new knowledge education and information

2247839 most of these college educated professionals from developing countries go to the united states as well as the european union australia and canada in fact canada and australia have the largest share of educated migrants out of the total number of migrants to those countries

2248033 nosotros lo que hemos hecho con sto es desarrollar la constituci n todas las leyes est n apegadas estrictamente a la carta magna ahora hay personas que lo consideran como un contrabando de la reforma constitucional y son los mismos argumentos que siempre han pronunciado as como lo hicieron con el tema de la propiedad privada que le iban a quitar la panader a a la gente que le iban a quitar a los ni os es el mismo argumento de siempre cuando se trata de medidas que van a beneficiar al com n de los venezolanos
2248034 nosotros si somos defensores de la constituci n y no hacemos nada que se salga de lo estipulado por ella
2248035 se aprob el primero de febrero del a o pasado el presidente fue habilitado en una serie de materias y dentro de las facultades que le confiri la asamblea nacional estuvo tambi n la de preparar o promulgar leyes con car cter org nico cumpliendo con el requisitos de enviarlas a la sala constitucional del tribunal supremo de justicia cosa que se cumpli
2248036 evidentemente no han le do la ley puesto que los componentes de la fuerza armada en la nueva ley siguen siendo el ej rcito la armada la aviaci n y la guardia nacional y a la reserva se le cambia la denominaci n a milicia nacional bolivariana aparece como un elemento de complemento a los componentes de la fuerza armada as est establecido en la ley
2248037 por ejemplo est la ley de migraci n de las actividades en la faja petrol fera del orinoco que implic la recuperaci n y la nacionalizaci n real de las operaciones en la faja pero hay otra ley que no se menciona en ning n momento que es la famosa ley de amnist a que sali a mediados del a o pasado y que gracias a ella muchos de los que salen hoy atacando la habilitante pueden hacerlo libremente sin ning n riesgo porque estaban acusados de violar la constituci n y del golpe del 11 12 y 13 de abril de 2002
2248038 no existe ning n art culo de la constituci n que lo prohiba porque el pa s se denomina rep blica bolivariana de venezuela la constituci n igual es decir que el calificativo de bolivariano para la rep blica puede ser utilizado por cualquiera de los entes nada lo prohibe
2248039 eso es mentira nadie est nombrando poderes locales ni regionales lo que establece la constituci n las competencias y facultades que tienen los gobernadores y alcaldes en ning n momento est n disminuidas
2248040 se est n refiriendo fundamentalmente a una ley que debe ir a un proceso de discusi n m s amplio que tiene que ver con el reordenamiento del territorio sin embargo hemos tenido en el pa s autoridades de desarrollo regional que han sido nombradas previstas en la constituci n del a o 1961 por eso vemos corpozulia corpooriente corpollano corpoandes que existieron en determinado momento
2248041 est en un proceso de inscribir nuestros candidatos a las alcald as y gobernaciones porque el proceso para nombrarlos es por medio del sufragio
2248042 la propiedad privada se utiliza como argumento para tratar de justificar la especulaci n el acaparamiento y el boicot la persona que realiza actividades donde se prestan servicios a la gente como alimentos medicinas sabe en todas partes del mundo que tiene que cumplir las reglas porque est obligado a prestar ese servicio
2248043 eso no tiene que ver con la propiedad privada tiene que ver con las actividades que inciden en el funcionamiento del estado y est n orientadas a satisfacer las necesidades de la gente

2248063 we hope that we will not be drawn apart and that we will be able to remain in serious dialogue in search of full unity so that the world may believe
2248064 it is a strength of anglicanism that even in the midst of difficult circumstances you have sought the views and perspectives of your ecumenical partners even when you have not always particularly rejoiced in what we have said
2248065 is well founded in the old and in the new testament
2248066 the catholic church finds herself bound by the will of jesus christ and does not feel free to establish a new tradition alien to the tradition of the church of all ages
2248067 the catholic church must now take account of the reality that the ordination of women to the priesthood and the episcopate is not only a matter of isolated provinces but that this is increasingly the stance of the communion
2248068 while our dialogue has led to significant agreement on the understanding of ministry the ordination of women to the episcopate effectively and definitively blocks a possible recognition of anglican orders by the catholic church
2248069 it now seems that full visible communion as the aim of our dialogue has receded further
2248070 it would not be sustained by the dynamism which arises from the realistic possibility of the unity christ asks of us or the shared partaking of the one lords table for which we so earnestly long
2248071 should we and how can we appropriately and honestly engage in conversations
2248072 your deep attentiveness to human challenges and struggles your desire for human dignity and justice or your concern with the active role of all women and men in the church

2248076 i added and this is not my vision yes she said
2248077 the speaker would be someone whose theology or teaching were pretty much in concert with that of the church

2248111 the tbi just left my house not only do they have a file on it now but theyre investigating it after all
2248112 i shouldve known youd be in this section you damn feminazi
2248113 shes been calling me too you never shouldve told her you and i were doing something today i had to convince her you came all the way to nashville so she didnt try to come here but she still got mad and said she would have ridden with you if she wouldve known so i just told her we were on a top secret mission and i couldnt talk about it
2248114 now she probably thinks were off getting each other into some kind of trouble
2248115 well there has to be an entrance to the roof upstairs
2248116 because one night my dad walked upstairs to get something and there was a crack head sleeping on one of the couches and i remember my dad saying that guy jumped up and dashed to the door in the file room and climbed out before he could even say anything
2248117 like a utility knife is really going to do anything
2248118 forget that if i see a crack head im running
2248119 this must be stationary leftover from when my dad worked for the tbi during law school
2248120 first i must mention that you are not suspected of any criminal involvement
2248121 we are only requesting that you provide us with any information you have about a particular date and or anything you feel will be helpful to our investigation into the activities of lisa l walker and perilee j willis cell phone records indicate that you had contact with both walker and willis on saturday march 19 2005
2248122 both walker and willis have been tied to an underground radical feminist organization known as the womens justification coalition
2248123 i cant believe were using my p o box oh i hope she writes a letter to harry weiner ill frame it and hang it on my wall
2248124 i cant talk perilee all i can say is watch your back and you need to be careful what you say on your cell phone ive gotta go ive said too much already
2248125 why dont you tell me whats going on callie perilee said you think were in some sort of trouble with the government or something
2248126 i dont have much time i got a letter from the tbi and it said that you and perilee were getting yourselves in all kinds trouble and they want to know if i know anything about it and i dont i dont know what yall are doing but apparently you need to stop because they know all about your little underground feminist crime posse
2248127 well yeah im going to write that local tbi agent guy like they told me to my parents said i have to
2248128 they snatched it out of my hand as soon as i read it because they saw the expression on my face my parents said i cant risk talking to either of you anymore
2248129 she gave the letter to her divorce lawyer were in deep trouble
2248130 yes im serious this is like tbi serious her lawyer gave the letter to the da who sent it to the tbi were in big trouble lisa what are we going to do
2248131 see perilee and i were goofing off upstairs one night and i know im not supposed to be up here at night but thats not really the point the point is that we decided we were going to play an april fools joke on callie and it didnt turn out how wed thought
2248132 well see we found this box of your old stuff and it had some tbi stationary in it
2248133 you dont say a word to anyone do you understand
2248134 youve committed forgery mail fraud the impersonation of a government official and thank god you didnt ask her to send money or something because then you wouldve been charged with a heck of a lot more holy cow not to mention if she wouldve killed herself or someone else over this you couldve even been charged with murder dead gummit lisa
2248135 they do say that a real friend wont be the one bailing you out of jail theyre the one sitting right beside you laughing
2248136 well the da actually got a pretty good kick out of it and the real local tbi agent
2248137 yes lisa and he was not so entertained by it but he agreed to recommend that the investigation be dismissed since it was a harmless prank as long as nothing like this happens again even though there is still a file on it in nashville its a good thing you put your own p o box since that pretty much showed you werent trying to hide it wow i cant believe you did that
2248138 what an idiot i cant believe she believed that how stupid can she be
2248139 the things they carried was from the perspective of someone who was there and was just telling the events whereas

2248149 although a healthier downtown with reasonable density is good for the entire region the high density focus does not make a good fit for a predominately middle class family oriented region such as sacramento
2248150 long term demographic trends and perhaps common sense suggest that most people do not move to sacramento to indulge in a
2248151 the fact sacramento has fared far better than these cities over the past 15 years suggests the regions recent problems lie not in a lack of downtown condos and nightlife but with a housing market that as in much of california has been totally out of whack
2248152 as a result the refugees from the coastal counties who had been coming to sacramento for affordable housing stopped arriving net migration to the region more than 36 000 in 2001 fell to less than 1 000 in 2006
2248153 all of the local taxes must survive proposition 218 a measure approved by voters as a follow up to proposition 13 that raises the voting threshold for local taxes that are used for general purposes such as the proposed santa clara tax for schools
2248154 that hurdle was driven home in a supreme court decision last month that invalidated another santa clara county tax a property assessment imposed by the santa clara county open space authority in 2001 to finance expansion
2248155 the assessment violated proposition 218 because it failed to connect the revenue being collected to specific public improvements the court said in a ruling that contained this somewhat acidic observation

2248260 bristols just another high banked short track that you have to turn left on weve got enough testing time to get the hang of the place but a racecars still a racecar at the end of the day the similarities are they both have steering wheels and four tires my objective is to get it around bristol as fast as i possibly can and as consistently as i can the differences are in the weight and the motor but the only big difference i see is the open area that i have in a pro cup car versus a super late model
2248261 ive got a picture at the house of me and freddie from when he won the all american 400 a few years back hes always been a great guy that i can really relate to he used to be a school teacher so he can do a good job of explaining things to me that i can understand all i have to worry about is driving the racecar because ive got a good guy helping me that i can trust and understand
2248262 since we bought the pro cup equipment a while back weve been wanting to get out and race them but we stay so busy with our super late model and pro late model stuff we just didnt have the chance to get out there just yet we moved into a new shop over the winter and didnt really get into it until about mid season but everythings happened so fast weve got everything just about ready and well get out and test a couple times before the race so that we can go out there and have a good solid first race

2248287 we have had some very positive discussions with houston involving ron but no trade is imminent at this time
2248288 he never wanted to leave sacramento but because of business he has to
2248289 ron is grateful adelman wants him to play for him again its a wish come true
2248290 hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands
2248291 thats not going to change im never going to change my culture yao has played with a lot of black players but i dont think hes ever played with a black player that really represents his culture as much as i represent my culture once yao ming gets to know me hell understand what im about
2248292 if you go back to the brawl thats a culture issue right there somebody was disrespecting me so hes got to understand where im coming from people that know me know that ron artest never changed
2248293 weve still got to make sure theres still a commitment from the rockets
2248294 thats the main thing is to make sure theres still a commitment when i speak to the powers that be of the organization were going to find out how much they really want me there well find out im still waiting to find out if this is just a trade or if this is like a long term commitment type thing i havent spoken to anybody yet im still waiting
2248295 i guess once yao ming approves the deal ill be a houston rocket
2248296 yao probably shouldve called me first but at the same time its yao mings team
2248297 whatever yao ming wants me to do ill be there whatever tracy mcgrady tells me to do thats how its going to go down ultimately whatever rick adelman tells me to do is exactly what im going to do
2248298 because in the games we play against him i hate him
2248299 when i text messaged with luis scola we talked about team chemistry
2248300 theres worry obviously yes hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands i have to find a way to talk to him and see what we can do as a basketball team he has a history but we know he is a physical player he is a good player he really can help us

2248322 as an expression of his ongoing pastoral concern for those who have been abused by members of the clergy his holiness pope benedict xvi today celebrated mass with a representative group of victims he listened to their stories and offered them consolation assuring them of his spiritual closeness he promised to continue to pray for them their families and all victims through this paternal gesture the holy father wished to demonstrate again his deep concern for all those who have suffered sexual abuse
2248323 the meeting took place at the celebration of mass in the little chapel of sydney s cathedral house where the pope has been staying over these days the celebration began at 7 a m
2248324 four people were present two men and two women with their attendants and a priest responsible for pastoral care and accompaniment
2248325 concelebrating with the holy father were cardinal george pell archbishop of sydney archbishop fernando filoni substitute of the secretariat of state and the popes two private secretaries
2248326 at the end of the mass the guests had the chance to speak individually to the pope who addressed to them affectionate words of concern and comfort
2248327 the meeting ended shortly before 8 a m everything took place in an atmosphere of respect spirituality and intense emotion
2248328 as happened in the united states the pope wished to meet a number of victims as a concrete way of conveying sentiments he has previously expressed on various occasions concerning the drama of sexual abuse
2248329 in australia he wished to do so after the events of world youth day because that was the specific reason for his trip
2248330 we have been able to witness at first hand the joy that so many thousands of young people find in their faith and we have been able to offer praise and thanksgiving to god for his goodness to us we have had a taste of the warmth and generosity of australian hospitality and we have glimpsed something of the glorious scenery of this beautiful continent it has truly been a week to remember
2248331 i want to thank all of you for the generous commitment of time and energy you have made in order to ensure the smooth running of each of the events we have celebrated together your efforts have prepared the ground for the spirit to come down in power forging bonds of unity and friendship among young people from widely differing backgrounds and rekindling their love for jesus christ and his church in the crowds that have assembled here in sydney we have seen a vivid expression of the unity in diversity of the universal church a vision in microcosm of the united human family that we long to see in the power of the spirit may these young people make that vision a reality in the world of tomorrow
2248332 as i set off on my journey back to rome
2248333 i shall treasure the memory of the many grace filled events we have experienced together
2248334 i pray that you too will take many precious memories and spiritual insights away with you and will return to your homes and families with fresh zeal to spread the gospel of jesus christ in the power of the spirit go forth now to renew the face of the earth
2248335 you have extended a warm welcome to me and to countless young pilgrims who have flocked here from every corner of the globe
2248336 the principal actors on the stage over these last few days of course have been the young people themselves world youth day is their day it is they who have made this a global ecclesial event a great celebration of youth and a great celebration of what it is to be the church the people of god throughout the world united in faith and love and empowered by the spirit to bear witness to the risen christ to the ends of the earth
2248337 for the opportunity to pray at the shrine of their co foundress
2248338 was a moment of joy and great hope a sign that christ can lift us out of the most difficult situations restoring our dignity and enabling us to look forward to a brighter future
2248339 and without doubt the gatherings at barangaroo and southern cross were high points of my visit those experiences of prayer and our joyful celebration of the eucharist were an eloquent testimony to the life giving work of the holy spirit present and active in the hearts of our young people world youth day has shown us that the church can rejoice in the young people of today and be filled with hope for the world of tomorrow
2248340 these words which i command you today shall be in your heart you shall teach them diligently to your children and shall talk of the m when you sit in your house when you walk by the way when you lie down and when you rise up

2248356 it is unfortunate that cases of this nature the way things are attract overwhelming media publicity
2248357 there is no doubt a prurient interest in the case that people will want to read about unfortunately that is human nature
2248358 this is such perverse and depraved behaviour it reflects a person of enormous deficiency in personality

2248363 we have been very concerned about the misunderstanding of our product in the marketplace and want to provide the facts so that consumers can make their choices based on science rather than urban myth
2248364 our message is that people should cut down on both

2248367 let me finish with this lady first as she was here before you
2248368 she was surprised and said that the main goal of doing business is profit and that company is sure to close soon with those prices she said that bell spends so much in maintenance and customer support that they cant offer prices any lower than the current ones

2248371 i think if he ever gets to canada hell probably incorporate that and newfoundland and something with the residential schools
2248372 individual bishops in individual dioceses have made apologies they were made here with bishop macdonald and before but to have it come from the holy father himself im sure it will have a much greater impact
2248373 the present pope is a shy man but he has a very pleasant personality the thing that strikes you about him is the speeches and talks that he gives he weighs every word and i think what he says he means for people to reflect on it and for universities to study what he says
2248374 i think the whole sexual abuse stuff has been a great pain for the pope it has been a pain for most bishops and for the church and it really hurt the church there was a tremendous loss of trust and a loss of faith because of the abuse and the scandal
2248375 i think its wise that he does it it comes from the top and he shows that he is concerned that he does know what is going on and this has hurt not only the church here but it hurt the church universal
2248376 he is trying to make inroads of trying to set up a process where people who have been abused can return to the lay state so he wants to deal with it in a very effective way

2248379 the remarkable accomplishment of that exemplary american priest the venerable michael mcgivney whose vision and zeal led to the establishment of the knights of columbus
2248380 indigenous peoples and campesinos represent a high percentage of the population of latin america the rapid process of urbanisation of the continent and the imposition of a post modern culture have isolated these peoples from the social context and from the development to which others have had access thus they have been largely marginalised and lack protection on many occasions unjustly losing ownership of their lands the efforts of the ecclesial community to defend and assist these peoples have been broadly supported by recent popes from paul vi to servant of god john paul ii to benedict xvi and one sign of such concern is the pontifical populorum progressio foundation
2248381 the projects presented to the foundation prepared by the various ecclesial communities and by pastoral groups within dioceses are first approved by diocesan bishops then examined by the administrative council
2248382 they are all aimed at the integral development of peoples and involve the following sectors 29 9 percent to agriculture livestock and small businesses 33 2 percent to public service infrastructures such as the supply of drinking water fencing toilets and communal halls 19 46 percent to the building of schools houses and health centres 12 3 percent to professional training communication tools and publications 5 14 percent to healthcare medical equipment and staff training
2248383 in spite of how frequently businesses of all kinds are forced to deal with changing technology and markets its surprising that a significant percentage would feel theyre bad at managing the process
2248384 the good news is that e mail is an inexpensive and flexible medium making it the best communication option in many ways the bad news is that its also a thin medium that the research shows is easy to misinterpret and otherwise abuse its no wonder that information overload continues to plague a lot of organizations
2248385 outsourcing transactional processes frees up internal staff but many firms feel that outsourcing relinquishes too much control
2248386 costs are reduced service is improved and hr gets more opportunities to strategize rather than just serve as an administrator
2248387 in order to maintain high productivity levels while keeping expenses in check its clear that companies are quickly changing work practices and policies in response to rapidly rising fuel costs
2248388 however its also clear that there is room for improvement while the flexibility in work hours and travel is admirable very few companies are spending the time to educate employees about ways to curtail their fuel consumption sometimes education is the best form of prevention
2248389 for all the public gnashing of teeth about the impending retirement of all those knowledgeable hard working baby boomers relatively few organizations are doing much about it
2248390 theyre going to wind up in a mad bar the doors scramble in the near future if they dont start trying to tap the knowledge of their most knowledgeable boomers
2248391 certainly people who believe they are homosexual need love support and understanding

2248400 this must be it the most urgent and explosive and powerfully swinging new big band to have appeared in years
2248401 kwela jauntiness plus a sort of ceremonial abandon which seems to inform some of dudu pakewanas sic more inspired flights
2248402 im not interested in that highly organised compositional aspect of big band music i go for moods for feelings and textures and most of my things are very sketchy that way the guys themselves can contribute more to whats going on
2248403 there are so many ways of making music and they all interest me
2248404 but there seems little hope of their becoming more than merely available
2248405 this is a great shame because by the time these bands he was writing about the brotherhood as well as graham colliers septet and the mike westbrook band are well known enough to force companies to record them whole stages of their development will have vanished forever
2248406 if anyone tells you that happiness has gone out of jazz tell them about the brotherhood of breath
2248407 if anyone says that the new music is committed to overtones of anger and hatred tell them about chris mcgregors big band if anyone asks you where have all the firemen gone tell them about chris mcgregors brotherhood of breath
2248408 and say it loud for if you dont the band will stow away their charts and fold up their music stands for another three years
2248409 they keep on trying to tell us that jazz is dead and rocks the thing but not so folks with men like mcgregors around jazz will never die

2248414 if i have a kid at forty ill be nearly sixty when they graduate
2248415 its remarkable that so few companies are proactively addressing retirement issues
2248416 especially when you consider the wave of baby boomers who are almost eligible for retirement now you would think that more companies would be paying attention to ways of capturing and keeping all that accumulated knowledge unfortunately it appears most will probably not worry about it until the day they see it walking out the door for good
2248417 we recognize the need to formalize a program but have not done so yet some of the more progressive areas of the company are working with potential retirees to help transition them into retirement and to enable the company to benefit by obtaining the knowledge the future retiree has acquired
2248418 businesses must find ways to handle religious conflicts while allowing room for employees spiritual needs
2248419 effectively handling religious differences not only requires specific attention but also creativity empathy and fairness
2248420 this is interesting because by law all companies are supposed to offer reasonable accommodations
2248421 theyre citing not enough time talent or money and too many conflicting priorities as top impediments to accomplishing their employers goals
2248422 finally the reverend billy graham dean of american evangelism reminded us of the fog of historys unfolding in his remarks at the service in the national cathedral for the national day of prayer and remembrance on september 14 2001 reverend graham insisted that he did not know the answer to why god allows tragedy and that there is a mystery at the heart of this question september 11 did teach some lessons however lessons about the mystery of iniquity and evil but secondly its a lesson about our need for each other and in this need lies hope this may be the only true christian message to have come out of the horror of that day a message of hope and human solidarity
2248423 i think the world would be better off if everyone focused on their own family
2248424 i grew up saying the words liberty and justice for all
2248425 neurotransmitters maybe havent figured out how to let me sleep peacefully
2248426 studies show that anti depressants work best in conjunction with therapy
2248427 oxygen levels while they remain lower than waking levels through the night due to my hypopnea shallow breathing my insurance doesnt cover the treatment so i categorically shouldnt have a sleep problem
2248428 i dont know if you can learn too much from last year the road course stuff i feel like our cars are really good i had a really fast car last year its the best ive ever run here at sonoma we were extremely fast so ive been really excited to come back here the number one thing is just dont make any mistakes in your strategy dont run off the race track stuff like that its a really fun race track
2248429 you can pass at a lot of places on this track it just depends on how you set someone up the best way to pass here is to let the guy in front of you make a mistake somewhere and then capitalize on that but definitely into turn one into that last turn before the esses at the bus stop right there you can pass there you can get started on a pass at least theres a lot of opportunities here to pass
2248430 oh yeah these next five races are win at all costs just get the wins get the bonus points we not really worried about anything other than that
2248431 for us our team is really in a position right now ehere we dont have to worry too much about having a bad race but for a lot of the teams at the tail end of the chase field this tracks really important you can have such a bad day here through a small mistake that this will be a little bit of a bottleneck for a lot of guys theres a lot of pressure this is really nice to come here without that pressure because i know how that feels
2248432 i liked racing in the rain i thought it was fun it looks like we might race in a little bit of wet on saturday it would be crazy to do that two weeks in a row it looks like its going to rain a little bit today but the rains fine with me i had a blast it was a new experience and something ill never forget
2248433 oh yeah for instance this weeks been great i know that im coming here and all i have to do is try to win the race i dont have to worry about points ive got no stress its just go out and have fun and thats a real rarity in spring cup competition you never are able to come to the race track without any stress
2248434 the guys put a great deal of effort into the entry and i appreciate that they tried to accommodate my desire to race in front of my hometown fans in upstate new york
2248435 ill be there to support ron fellows and my guys any way i can and i look forward to getting back in the car next week at michigan
2248436 in this uncertain economic environment its clear companies are intent on not being caught flat footed
2248437 but so far its looking more like careful surgery than a bloodbath layoffs dont seem to be the first choice for a lot of companies
2248438 many business leaders are pretty canny about how to deal with a downturn raising productivity and designing new strategies to boost revenues are good business practices at any time but economic slowdowns seem to kick this into gear for many organizations
2248439 the two major league stadiums being built today represent private investments of more than 2 billion in two underserved and deserving neighborhoods
2248440 we believe its not fair to change course midstream of a transaction
2248441 im not saying that theyll change but its an important issue and were going to continue working on it
2248442 en een voor mij nieuw blog met het thema strand
2248443 however modern one is on the wedding day you should look traditional
2248444 youve had enough fun in life now time to have some babies
2248445 its ok to put off babies for first 2 years but you should have babies after that
2248446 when are you giving us a good news we need company
2248447 everyones asking me you are 30 what are you waiting for
2248448 im not worried about points im going to win the race
2248449 if you win the race then the points will be there im going to try my hardest to win these last two races and the snowball derby this year winning the snowball derbys been our big goal all year and that hasnt changed
2248450 i just go out there and do the best that i can
2248451 however the points shake out thats how they shake out i won the blizzard championship last year because i just go out there and try to win whatever race all the races actually and see how it shakes the points just kind of go with it
2248452 i think the competition has been a lot tougher this year
2248453 a lot of the guys that had been strong in races past arent as dominant as they used to be
2248454 weve had three different winners in three races but i wouldnt mind being the first repeat winner
2248455 because we are points racing you cant be as aggressive as you would like to be i am just ready to get back out on the track and see how it goes
2248456 im not saying that theyll change but its an important issue and were going to continue working on it

2248459 leftists have been the loudest and most successful activists on college campuses since the 1960s
2248460 for over a half century the intercollegiate studies institute isi has worked against the collectivist ideas on college campuses and has countered with the mission to further in successive generations of american college youth a better understanding of the economic political and spiritual values that sustain a free society
2248461 college campuses today have become bastions of marxism and political correctness
2248462 our time of troubles is like the disorder of the roman republic in the first century before christ and like the catastrophic collapse of roman civilization in the fifth century after christ as individuals and as a civilization we people in the twentieth century grope for order
2248463 the american revolution was not an innovative upheaval but a conservative restoration of colonial prerogatives thus men essentially conservative found themselves triumphant rebels
2248464 who could argue that this was a revolution whereby the colonists rebelled precisely to preserve their rights as british citizens when listing the grievances in the declaration of independence that brought forth the revolution thomas jefferson mentioned policies that the king and parliament had instituted that had violated the colonists rights most of these policies were recently enacted after the french and indian war it was the king and the parliament and not the colonists who were changing things therefore the revolution that ensued sought to restore things as they were before the innovations of the british government this was a conservative revolution
2248465 is there a possibility that the government of nations may fall into the hands of men who teach the most disconsolate of all creeds that men are but fireflies and that this all is without a father
2248466 that all men are born to equal rights is clear every being has a right to his own as moral as sacred as any other has but to teach that all men are born with equal powers and faculties to equal influence in society to equal property and advantages through life is as gross a fraud as glaring an imposition on the credulity of the people as ever was practiced by monks by druids by brahmins by priests of the immortal lama or by the self styled philosophers of the french revolution for honors sake for truth and virtues sake let american philosophers and politicians despise it
2248467 all sober inquirers after truth ancient and modern pagan and christian have declared that the happiness of man as well as his dignity consists in virtue
2248468 is and always has been that absolute power intoxicates alike despots monarchs aristocrats and democrats and jacobins and sans culottes
2248469 the most successful conservative device in the history of the world
2248470 leaders are considering establishing a city controlled nonprofit organization that could help create a bookstore and other programs to promote literacy
2248471 the move may enable pittsburg to enhance the creative arts community without dipping into its own pocketbook city officials say
2248472 there are few examples of city controlled nonprofit organizations like the one pittsburg has in mind said peter guadagni a city business development manager
2248473 what were trying to do is be a little more novel and innovative
2248474 first peter had to help its readers justify their existence as christians living as a holy community within society it was a single strategy with two interlocking components creating an identity that separated them from roman culture and yet showing how they as a community of the elect upheld the best of greek and roman values by living honorably among gentiles first peter does not urge its readers to reject the larger society wholesale instead it urges a policy of selective accommodation those values that contribute to moral ruin it rejects wholeheartedly those that foster political stability and social order it upholds steadfastly and encourages vigorously
2248475 these decisions are being made in secret in these soviet style meetings and it is outrageous
2248476 without counting bond proceeds the gap between last years revenues and expenditures was more than 7 billion
2248477 without a spending plan in place the state will run out of cash at the end of september and be forced to engage in costly borrowing to cover its bills
2248478 of course because some p2p applications bittorrent for example restrict download speed to the maximum upload speed provided by the user a customers p2p download speed can be limited by the upstream cap but that is a result of the business decision taken by the p2p applications provider

2248484 paul is pointing out the sharp distinction between the gentile polytheistic environment of the gentiles and the exclusivist monotheistic stance look at the language used idols versus a living and true god
2248485 essentially paul directs his converts to shun any overtly pagan religious activity and practice and he does so in the strongest kind of terms
2248486 demanded that because of this suspicion he undergo the usual purity probe in the temple and that four oath bound penitents be called in

2248491 for if these qualities are yours and are increasing they will keep you from being useless or unfruitful in the knowledge of our lord jesus christ the person who lacks these things is blind and shortsighted and has forgotten the cleansing from his past sins
2248492 hear the word of the lord people of israel for the lord has a case against the inhabitants of the land there is no truth no faithful love and no knowledge of god in the land
2248493 my people are destroyed for lack of knowledge because you have rejected knowledge

2248502 but one of the nice things about writing for my own soul and my own prayer is that i kind of move along with the community of people who know his music and i can write things that are meaningful for those same people

2248505 we had a huge shift that came with the second vatican council and a call to adapt our liturgy to this modern world rather than living and worshiping in a way that was somewhat disconnected from our daily and weekly experience it was a shifting of the ground beneath many peoples feet
2248506 a shift of the pendulum in the other way sort of a balancing were being reminded not to lose some of the pieces of music and rituals that have been part of our long roman catholic tradition
2248507 over the centuries the church has not adopted any one form of music as the way people should pray they the bishops legitimize contemporary music and other styles

2248510 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
2248511 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
2248512 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

2248523 indirect leadership is perhaps the most difficult to harness but it can be done atlantas mayor shirley franklin effectively used an indirect leadership strategy when she was determined to improve the services of the citys judicial system and eliminate wasteful practices in the organization by building support in the citys legal community and leveraging the expertise and influence of outside advocates to make a clear case for change mayor franklin led the way to a series of critical municipal court reforms despite her lack of direct authority
2248524 preparations for an african wall of trees to slow down the southwards spread of the sahara desert are getting underway
2248525 north african nations have been promoting the idea of a green belt since 2005 the project has been scaled down to reinforce and then expand on existing efforts and will not be a continent wide wall of trees despite the name of the project
2248526 according to a report in enn environmental news network the great green wall will involve several stretches of trees from mauritania in the west to djibouti in the east to protect the semi arid savannah region of the sahel and its agricultural land from desertification

2248540 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
2248541 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
2248542 political parties are very much like corporations were before the advent of the networked computer they are hierarchical and rigid with leadership that is hard to displace or enter on any terms other than those laid down by the longest serving veterans as the networked computer broke down the old boys networks within companies and opened the membrane surrounding senior management not to mention unleashed a wave of outsourcing and exporting of formerly core assets to partners and overseas the internet is about to hollow out the major political parties as more people connect and learn through the internet public debate about the direction government should take has reached a critical mass that could transform the very notion of democratic systems this transition will not end differences of opinion nor will it abolish ideology from public debate it will simply make the debate more fluid with many more specific perspectives represented because the massive party infrastructures are becoming more porous the howard dean campaign where it was possible to find far left democrats hoping to stop the war in iraq working with moderate and center right republicans angry about runaway deficits working together demonstrates how an extremely democratic technology can bring together many perspectives its massive fund raising success of the howard dean campaign during 2003 and early 2004 which built a war chest of 45 million for a candidate who began his quest for the white house as an asterisk is the proof point for the transformation of politics via network that campaign failed for a variety of reasons but the example is a clear statement about peoples willingness to work together despite their differences when they see a clear opportunity to make a difference

2248557 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
2248558 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
2248559 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
2248560 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

2248576 i feel the greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion because it is a direct war a direct killing direct murder by the mother herself and we read in the scripture for god says very clearly even if a mother could forget her child i will not forget you i have carved you in the palm of my hand that unborn child has been carved in the hand of god
2248577 many people are very very concerned with children in india with the children of africa where quite a number die maybe of malnutrition of hunger and so on but millions are dying deliberately by the will of the mother and this is what is the greatest destroyer of peace today let us ensure this year that we make every single child born and unborn wanted have we really made the children wanted
2248578 i find the unborn child to be the poorest of the poor today the most unloved the most unwanted the throw away of the society

2248599 making the ownership link is relatively easy because water is already claimed by someone either a municipality individual farmers or a government agency
2248600 in practice however claims compete with one another especially when water is scarce
2248601 the recent drought in the southeast has raised a red flag about scarcity the best mechanism for allocating water is to clarify the ownership among municipal agricultural industrial and environmental users and allow trades if atlanta must buy water from lower valued agricultural users farmers will have an incentive to save water and sell it and municipal consumers will face a higher price and thus an incentive to conserve
2248602 streets account for as much as a third of the land in a city and historically they served as public spaces for social and economic exchanges
2248603 ironically the single minded pursuit of creating efficiency for the automobile travel has also failed to successfully address transportation issues as sprawling land use patterns and traffic congestion continue to grow exponentially despite new roadway mileage that generally outpaces population growth

2248619 our study shows for the first time the surprising speed with which humans make body fat from fructose
2248620 all three can be made into triglycerides a form of body fat however once you start the process of fat synthesis from fructose its hard to slow it down
2248621 its basically sneaking into the rock concert through the fence
2248622 its a less controlled movement of fructose through these pathways that causes it to contribute to greater triglyceride synthesis the bottom line of this study is that fructose very quickly gets made into fat in the body

2248673 congress has passed numerous laws protecting rights of conscience in health care beginning in 1973
2248674 the critics surprise that conscience protection may apply beyond the specific issue of abortion seems based on a lack of knowledge of existing federal law

2248756 you will receive power when the holy spirit has come upon you and you will be my witnesses
2248757 as the source of our new life in christ the holy spirit is also in a very real way the soul of the church the love which binds us to the lord and one another and the light which opens our eyes to see all around us the wonders of gods grace
2248758 the power of the spirit never ceases to fill the church with life
2248759 this power the grace of the spirit is not something we can merit or achieve but only receive as pure gift
2248760 gods love can only unleash its power when it is allowed to change us from within we have to let it break through the hard crust of our indifference our spiritual weariness our blind conformity to the spirit of this age only then can we let it ignite our imagination and shape our deepest desires that is why prayer is so important daily prayer private prayer in the quiet of our hearts and before the blessed sacrament and liturgical prayer in the heart of the church
2248761 which has come down to us like a treasure passed on from generation to generation
2248762 all those heroic missionaries dedicated priests and religious christian parents and grandparents teachers and catechists who built up the church in these lands
2248763 dear young people let me now ask you a question what will you leave to the next generation are you building your lives on firm foundations building something that will endure are you living your lives in a way that opens up space for the spirit in the midst of a world that wants to forget god or even rejects him in the name of a falsely conceived freedom how are you using the gifts you have been given the power which the holy spirit is even now prepared to release within you
2248764 empowered by the spirit and drawing upon faiths rich vision a new generation of christians is being called to help build a world in which gods gift of life is welcomed respected and cherished not rejected feared as a threat and destroyed
2248765 needs this renewal in so many of our societies side by side with material prosperity a spiritual desert is spreading an interior emptiness an unnamed fear a quiet sense of despair how many of our contemporaries have built broken and empty cisterns in a desperate search for meaning the ultimate meaning that only love can give
2248766 she needs your faith your idealism and your generosity so that she can always be young in the spirit
2248767 to those of you whom the lord is calling to the priesthood and the consecrated life do not be afraid to say yes to jesus to find your joy in doing his will giving yourself completely to the pursuit of holiness and using all your talents in the service of others
2248768 not being afraid to stand up for christ letting the truth of the gospel permeate the way we see think and act as we work for the triumph of the civilisation of love
2248769 the lords summons to dedicate her life to him in a very particular way a way that would involve the generous gift of herself her womanhood her motherhood
2248770 she was filled with apprehension utterly overwhelmed at the prospect that lay before her the angel understood her anxiety and immediately sought to reassure her do not be afraid mary the holy spirit will come upon you and the power of the most high will overshadow you it was the spirit who gave her the strength and courage to respond to the lords call who helped her to understand the great mystery that was to be accomplished through her
2248771 this scene is perhaps the pivotal moment in the history of gods relationship with his people
2248772 in fairy tales the story ends there and all live happily ever after in real life it is not so simple for mary there were many struggles ahead as she lived out the consequences of the yes that she had given to the lord simeon prophesied that a sword would pierce her heart when jesus was twelve years old she experienced every parents worst nightmare when for three days the child went missing and after his public ministry she suffered the agony of witnessing his crucifixion and death throughout her trials she remained faithful to her promise sustained by the spirit of fortitude and she was gloriously rewarded
2248773 we too must remain faithful to the yes that we have given to the lords offer of friendship we know that he will never abandon us that he will always sustain us through the gifts of the spirit mary accepted the lords proposal in our name so let us turn to her and ask her to guide us as we struggle to remain faithful to the life giving relationship that god has established with each one of us
2248774 the time has come for me to say good bye or rather to say arrivederci i thank you all for your participation in world youth day 2008 here in sydney and i look forward to seeing you again in three years time world youth day 2011 will take place in madrid spain until then let us continue to pray for one another and let us joyfully bear witness to christ before the world
2248775 not only for those sacrifices but even more for the confidence you have shown in our young people and your trust in gods grace at work in their hearts let us pray that the investment which so many of you have made in them will bear fruit in their own lives for the life of christs church and for the future of our world
2248776 st paul who devoted his entire life to the service of the gospel reminds us that it is more blessed to give than to receive your generosity and sacrifice have been an essential yet often hidden ingredient in the success of this world youth day may the spiritual joy the satisfaction and the fulfilment that we have all experienced in these days be an unfailing source of blessings in your own lives may you never doubt the truth of our lords promise that whenever we give our creativity energy resources and our very selves to him we will gain them back abundantly

2248808 i looked for one that would grieve together with me and there was none and i sought one that would console me and i found none

2248810 her painful darkness mysteriously united her so intimately with her crucified spouse that he became the sole object of her thoughts and affections the subject of her conversations the end of her actions and the model of her life her total surrender to his will and her determination not to refuse him anything allowed him to manifest through her his love for each individual it was the light and love of jesus himself that radiated from her in the midst of her own darkness and that had such an impact on others

2248826 we are used to seeing people with flags painted on their faces so i thought why not just put them into your head
2248827 i dont believe in god i dont believe jesus christ was the son of a god that i dont believe in nor do i believe jesus rose from the dead to ascend to a heaven that i dont believe exists my decision to join a church was more a political than a theological act

2248837 was kinda tired last night that i actually went to bed at 9 pm
2248838 if even one patient given the needle treatment had come back without a hole i might have had my doubts but this shows that acupuncture works
2248839 as you can see when the needle is pushed into the patients skin it breaks through the outer layer and so creates a tiny hole but even after you remove it the hole remains still think its all in the mind
2248840 a report came out last week that said acupuncture is no help whatsoever if you are trying to get up the duff call that science what about china
2248841 that a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout

2248846 set the stage for what i think is a much needed more serious real debate on the issues
2248847 i have absolutely no interest in dick armey as president but the ideas are very important and i dont see anybody out there right now who has taken on the big ideas
2248848 hes so bogged down in the war he did not give it the leadership attention he should have i dont think you can mark that as a failure just because it didnt get done it didnt get done because the president was so wrapped up with the war in iraq that he didnt get the chance to spend the time on it and assert the leadership
2248849 with people still killing each other in horrific numbers in eastern congo why worry about the destruction of a national park and its few hundred gorillas because according to the dian fossey gorilla fund one is closely tied to the other
2248850 in the past decade thousands of people both soldiers and civilians have fled into the kahuzi biega national park a swathe of tropical forest near congos border with rwanda
2248851 but war alone is not responsible or more subtly one of the causes of the war is also a cause of deforestation coltan colombite tantalite to give its full name is a valuable mineral spewed out by the local volcanoes it is found scattered widely over the area including in the park and demand for coltan has thus mushroomed over the past decade this demand lured 12 000 people to kahuzi biega where they could earn a princely 80 a day with just a pick a shovel and a sieve
2248852 kinkan shonen has the clear smooth grace of a rock in a japanese garden and the impact simultaneously of the same rock hurled
2248853 so to a certain extent when the water level goes down it affects all of the companies
2248854 we go through it in practice every day thats the presence that a quarterback has with his team and i think its coming along
2248855 its not something i think about as being a major or minor step
2248856 its just this is my role right now im just going to go out there and do my job execute the offense as well as i can and play each play and go from there
2248857 all im really trying to focus on is just my reps when i get in there what i do with them thats the biggest deal right now taking advantage of that getting out there executing the offense moving the ball
2248858 he did a nice job of that the other day
2248859 i also thought the other guys did a pretty good job of that but that is one of the things i saw a few times where he improvised and made a couple of plays i am pleased with all three quarterbacks though so its good competition but i am pleased with all three
2248860 it was hard for me to watch knowing i was supposed to be there
2248861 if they try to stick a safety or a linebacker on me im going to run right by them davis said
2248862 ever since ive been here ive been running by guys
2248863 you get bored with the same thing but thats just part of it it was fun a lot more productive than i thought it was going to be i thought peoples tempers would be flying but it really wasnt it was good it was a good practice i got a lot out of it
2248864 i think it seemed like the defense got the best ends on both sides of the field which would be normal situation with guys coming in and not knowing what the other side is going to do exactly and what theyve been doing all offseason
2248865 it was just that when i hit him it kind of lifted him up i guess it was kind of too hard for him i didnt really hit him that hard but he got kind of upset
2248866 if things are important to you you will fight about it
2248867 we had a couple of those it was nothing that took away from our ability to work
2248868 i didnt look to start any fights or anything like that
2248869 as my coach said if you get into anything be careful to do it safely and be smart i just pretty much walked away from everything
2248870 those are the guys that brought me into this league like family in a sense
2248871 theres not the sense of vindictiveness as much as its like playing against your sibling
2248872 the app is a work of art and included a secret mantra thats all
2248873 i want this shirt you are going to be so proud of me
2248874 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
2248875 we hope to guide customers to the right information faster
2248876 since only a handful of pages are responsible for most of our site traffic were making it a little easier to find the links to those pages
2248877 im open to all three right now and thats where my mindset is
2248878 were all anxious to get to one i know i am and then again im not
2248879 its early in camp theres a lot of work to get done i want to know if we do have to go to another if we get to a second quarterback or a third something like that what is he capable of doing so this is a valuable time for us this is not just trying to find out whos no 1 this is also trying to find out who gives us a chance our very best chance to win
2248880 there is a sense of familiarity with the offense and im trying to grow from that
2248881 what i really try to do is get better and better every day my job is to be ready
2248882 its evident that hes been in it because with the limited reps hes had so far if it was all new to him this year he wouldnt be where hes at
2248883 so he is further ahead that is one of the reasons too we felt early in training camp in fairness to the other two guys we needed to get them up to speed because j t does have a year under his belt
2248884 weve only been here a week so its still early but thats an important decision i dont want to sell us short its going to happen on the field its going to happen in fairness and three guys are competing for it
2248885 its not going to be 100 percent fair with reps practice snaps but were doing the best we can
2248886 theres a pretty big difference between all three of them with their personalities
2248887 its probably why they get along as a group pretty well if two of them were like j t there might be some in house duking
2248888 and if there were two of them like alex or shaun its just not enough competition its a good complement for one another kind of like opposites attract
2248889 im been studying fullback tight end slot wide receiver i can do all those things i can line up in the backfield the wing or the slot im fired up because im in the rotation a lot more i expect a lot out of myself this season
2248890 just because our offense wasnt productive last year doesnt mean that we cant see who a good player is
2248891 hes a good character guy the kind of guy that you want to sign early and keep him around
2248892 id like to know what the 31 other teams are doing with it it would help me
2248893 obviously the whole premise of the thing is to make sure people quit stealing signals as we saw last year what occurred last year with the new england patriots is not right so this will eliminate all that and stay focused on the game and the way it should be played with integrity and sportsmanship
2248894 not that guys back off in regular practice but you know what youre going to get
2248895 a game isnt that way when you go into a game you feel guys out theres the unexpected
2248896 why would the raiders even want to practice with a pop warner team

2248907 when you consider the fact that he won five super bowls in 22 years that puts him in very rare company in our league
2248908 using a different calculator i see eddie as a no brainer
2248909 if youre able to remove yourself from the way that the game pulls you in in terms of history he is huge figure in the history of the game
2248910 vince lombardi was the image that was projected of nfl head coaches at the time
2248911 and i know because i was there i did bill walshs contract for the 49ers
2248912 eddie saw beyond that and saw something in bill that was special and frankly im not sure bill could have succeeded in the nfl aside from that environment created by eddie
2248913 i think the debartolo walsh partnership had a great deal to do with changing the nfl
2248914 the organizational set up of the 49ers greatly influenced the league if bill could think it up eddie would pay for it
2248915 eddie is about the best owner you could ever work for he was passionate about his team he was generous to the point that the league had to come up with a lot of rules we went to hawaii for a super bowl ring ceremony and he took everybody players coaches families everybody
2248916 eddie was so filled with pride so driven and passionate about building the team into something great
2248917 it was really something to me because here he was the son of this real estate magnate his dad basically came up with the idea for strip malls and he was driven to accomplish something himself
2248918 i remember when we went to hawaii and eddie brought everybody players families the front office everybody his father was 80 something at the time and had never been off the continental united states but he went to hawaii for that and you could see how much that meant to eddie that his father was so proud of him
2248919 if it were the other owners in the league he probably wouldnt get in but its the writers who do the voting so they might now view those transgressions the same way
2248920 i dont think that was the easiest moment for them
2248921 if you know eddie debartolo it was the ultimate sacrifice for him to lose that team
2248922 when he lost the team he lost a portion of his identity that was a hell of a price to pay hopefully as time goes one people can look at him with untinted glasses and understand what he brought to the league
2248923 this suite does deep scanning of your system offers to turn on security settings and finds system errors other scanners miss
2248924 i dont know why any quarterback wouldnt want to be a part of this im much more comfortable now than the first few days thats for sure this is the most throwing well do at any time to blow it out in the first few weeks would be dumb when your pitch count is that high its time for a day off
2248925 im still going to try to take advantage of the reps i get out there obviously there will be a difference with three guys instead of two as far as the numbers go other than that whether youre competing against one or two guys that really doesnt change my mind set
2248926 that was in the plan all along as far as how to get these guys some rest
2248927 naturally its his turn now i am confident that we have three quarterbacks we can win with i feel very good about that but the competition obviously is still going on
2248928 it definitely took longer than i thought but having the chance to get more reps now definitely helps out
2248929 im feeling a lot more comfortable with the position weve got another great fullback whos been here and been the starter for a while so were just working together to push each other and compete
2248930 i hadnt played fullback at all that year or at all in college but it was something intriguing i knew it would be a good challenge and thats something im always looking forward to maybe playing linebacker has helped out a little bit it helps me to have a little better understanding of what the defense is trying to do
2248931 zak has got a real good feel for getting through traffic and getting on linebackers and dbs as a blocker
2248932 hes unusual about it its kind of a lost art if you will he sees things and reacts to things very quickly and has such good body control that he can avoid blockers and get into little tiny holes and jump through and get to a linebacker its hard to find guys that can do that and he does that very well

2248935 as ive said all along weve got three quarterbacks battling for the position
2248936 j ts not back in it hes been in it this quarterback position is open whoever gives us the best chance to win is the guy
2248937 i think right now its just organized chaos and theyre just trying to learn all this stuff
2248938 i had no expectations about when my reps would come
2248939 im strictly about me being ready if they would have said the first day to jump in there i would have been ready if they say a month from now im going to be ready its about me doing my job as well as i can it doesnt change if im in the first group or the fifth group
2248940 i feel fine its just noticeably tired coaches felt like i needed a rest so thats what we did its kind of normal for this time of year were ready to go now

2248967 it was definitely important for me to be here day one and that was something my agent and myself both stressed
2248968 im sure the team was eager to hear that as well and we got it done as expected
2248969 this is an opportunity to work against some unfamiliar faces
2248970 players sometimes become comfortable with the level of competition during training camp this gives us the opportunity to raise that level and learn more about ourselves both individually and collectively
2248971 if we had one established quarterback it would be different but in our case we do not rather than name a guy and have it be his position to lose which is done in some cases and is something we might have done here in the past its different this time around
2248972 the whole foot was swollen up like one of those blowup gloves
2248973 i couldnt even put weight on it i couldnt even bend it my toes were so swollen it was really gross
2248974 the media and the fans look at the left side as being the premier position so it gets more publicity
2248975 youre more in the public eye if youre on the left side but i dont really concern myself with all that stuff
2248976 its good to be out here and not in my room
2248977 it was killing me not to be with my teammates
2248978 im growing i do miss a couple of guys back where i left but im here now
2248979 for the young receivers back there when were going through these routes he quietly will talk to these guys about how to beat coverage
2248980 the confidence it takes and changing direction just the technical aspect of it i think hes a help there and theres some things that he can do that hes not going to be able to teach anybody else hes just isaac thats isaac
2248981 i played against this defense for the last two seasons and this defense has been really good
2248982 special teams has been good as well they have a lot of different nuances that they can run with the players that they have
2248983 when i start to explain that to you youll be messing with my speech so you know i can only say that mr d eddie d hes instrumental in my life in more ways than one some ways probably more than mr d even knows himself
2248984 but he gave me a lot of inspiration and so did coach walsh to me it was one of the lower moments in my life i was kind of depressed because i was leaving the chargers coach bill walsh he brought me in mr eddie he accepted me you know theres so much inside of me that its really difficult for me to explain right now
2248985 the pressure he could apply from the outside and the push we got on the inside really people forget how good of a defense it was
2248986 he was the freak before the freak he was like in that he wasnt especially big he was barely bigger than a linebacker at that i probably weighed more than him fred was quick and he was strong he had natural strength
2248987 being paid less than a truck driver at that time you know that makes a difference in life for me when my brother in law would tell me hey i make that much driving a truck you know things like that
2248988 when he was traded in 81 that really changed things for our defense it put a lot more strain on the front and the linebackers it affected our effectiveness
2248989 obviously he had great success in san francisco im happy for him
2248990 i actually stepped on the other side for a minute breathed in the air looked at it as a rainbow i made it to the other side of the rainbow for me that was the pot of gold it was a different lifestyle for me altogether i felt free to perform once i got there
2248991 i started for the chargers was a down lineman played every down with coach walsh he said im going to use you sparingly for rushing the passer he said he didnt know what my condition was
2248992 the first game he said id only play like 10 or 12 plays
2248993 yes i take a great deal of pride in that because you know to be the person that does something regardless of what it is if its anything out of the ordinary it makes you real good it makes you proud of it
2248994 its that whether youre 14 2 and youre marty schottenheimer or if youre 5 11 and mike nolan you can lose your job it doesnt really matter and if youre afraid of that in this profession youre in the wrong profession ive always known that
2248995 this was the day we wanted to give him a little bit more reps
2248996 he wont do a lot in two practice days but one of the practices he will he got more today

2249048 as california looks for new ways to increase water supplies in the face of mounting shortages this monstrous 602 foot facade holding back the sacramento river seems destined to grow even taller
2249049 its a perfect spot for expansion although its not the only site under intense scrutiny in this scramble for new water storage
2249050 shasta dam was designed to be 800 feet tall so adding concrete to its top presents no significant engineering obstacles
2249051 this is like adding a room on a house rather than building a new house
2249052 but most importantly the clean cold water it would add to the states supply is exactly what water managers are looking for
2249053 from an engineering standpoint its a piece of cake the dam built between 1938 and 1945 was originally planned to be 200 feet taller at 800 feet it would have been the highest and biggest in the world
2249054 if shasta dam had been built up to its engineering limit in 1945 it is arguable that northern and central california would not be facing a critical water shortage now
2249055 according to a 1999 bureau of reclamation study a dam 200 feet taller would be able to triple storage to 13 89 million acre feet of water
2249056 still tripling the size of shasta lake on paper at least would store nine times the projected 2020 water deficit for the sacramento san joaquin and tulare lake basins during normal water years
2249057 but the bureau of reclamation concluded in its 1999 report on shasta dam that raising it by 200 feet would be prohibitively expensive 5 8 billion
2249058 but as for the catholics it seemed in pops mind that there was a certain sinister note of malice connected with the profession of anything like the catholic faith the catholic church was the only one against which i ever heard him speak with any definite bitterness or animosity this was one of the few things i got from pop that really took root in my mind and became part of my mental attitude this hatred and suspicion of catholics there was nothing overt about it it was simply the deep almost subconscious aversion from the vague and evil thing which i called catholicism which lived back in the dark corners of my mentality with other spooks like death and so on i did not know precisely what the word meant it only conveyed a kind of cold and unpleasant feeling
2249059 the devil is no fool he can get people feeling about heaven the way they ought to feel about hell he can make them fear the means of grace the way they do not fear sin and he does so not by light but by obscurity not by realities but by shadows not by clarity and substance but by dreams and the creatures of psychosis and men are so poor in intellect that a few cold chills down their spine will be enough to keep them from ever finding out the truth about anything
2249060 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

2249064 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
2249065 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
2249066 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
2249067 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
2249068 im getting married and ill be back at about 3 00 when i returned there was a bottle of champagne at my workspace

2249070 of the different malicious attacks outlined in this document conventional attacks on transport systems are judged to be some of the more likely to occur this assessment is supported by the many examples of this type of attack perpetrated by different groups across the globe
2249071 this is such a case which leads from dirty looks to death in one hour
2249072 the public have every right to be concerned about the increase growth of this sort of violence
2249073 it is a tragedy that this sort of triviality caused such a young man to lose his life and has caused enduring heartache to his friends and family
2249074 because in the games we play against him i hate him
2249075 when i text messaged with luis scola we talked about team chemistry
2249076 theres worry obviously yes hopefully hes not fighting anymore and going after a guy in the stands i have to find a way to talk to him and see what we can do as a basketball team he has a history but we know he is a physical player he is a good player he really can help us
2249077 weve still got to make sure theres still a commitment
2249078 thats the main thing when i speak to the powers that be of the houston rockets organization were going to find out how much they really want me there
2249079 if he wanted to me to close deals i could close it yes
2249080 were not going to rush through this process were going to go through this process pursuing all of his options
2249081 both of us would like to try to get it to resolution
2249082 were both struggling with the next steps a little bit
2249083 well clearly pay what the market will bear but the market is not clearly defined due to lack of information regarding his medical situation someone is worth what someone will pay as a club well go with the market or with what allows us to get other good players with him i do think well get this figured out were optimistic
2249084 its the 6 6 part that really puts him in a bad way is he a three or a four i think he still needs to work a little bit on chasing the scoring threes around the court around screens he is a little restricted in his height when you move him to the four but he has the heart he is the top worker on the team theres a spot on somebodys team maybe ours for mike
2249085 my goal is to play in the nba so i know that every opportunity that i can get to showcase my talent and what i can bring to the table i have to take full advantage of it
2249086 i think im doing really well im not doing anything special my game is not too special i just take open jump shots make the hustle plays get a few rebounds here and there im not going to blow you away athletically its kind of a simple game

2249135 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
2249136 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
2249137 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers

2249157 the increased traffic that arctic exploitation entails will mean more work for icebreakers adm
2249158 not only is russias fleet more numerous its also nuclear powered and its icebreakers are bigger the biggest named 50 years of victory can power through more than 9 feet of solid ice without slowing down ice thicker than 6 5 feet reduces the strongest u s icebreaker the diesel powered polar sea to backing up and ramming
2249159 we can do that by increasing our reliance on electricity
2249160 equally important is the fact that electricity can be produced using multiple sources of energy

2249179 the first initial indications of how this sense of community will impact the behavior of millennials as they enter young adulthood are now becoming available they contain good news for americas suburbs and for those remaining in family oriented neighborhoods in our nations cities

2249181 this generational trait is especially important for the future of americas suburbs
2249182 but to republicans the deficit is the symptom of a

2249197 entrepreneurial leaders need to be a little bit deaf and a little bit blind by definition theyre trying to do something that defies the common view they have to be inured to skeptics they have to believe that their vision is true and they can make it happen but if they are
2249198 and whether its a start up or not you need a leader with adequate self knowledge lots of entrepreneurs especially those who experience early success dont understand the basis for their success and believe themselves infallible those entrepreneurs tend to fail the next time hard without understanding your own strengths and weaknesses you are unlikely to create an organization with the genetics for success where each piece complements the rest and the whole is stronger than the parts
2249199 and maybe hitting a whole new level on game play theyre not kidding when they brag about the game being made for every system ever made as they still are releasing copies for the ps2 and original x box as well as games with the newer versions with the ps3 and x box 360

2249225 he called my name and we shook hands and i held up the packers jersey and then he told me good things happen to people who are patient
2249226 ted has done a great job building our team through the draft and coach mccarthy has done a great job with the day to day stuff weve got a great group of players ive been there the whole offseason and have been hanging out with guys away from the stadium and building a great rapport with my teammates its a great situation
2249227 ive been trying to be as open as i can possibly be
2249228 i told both brian and matt from the start that if they have any questions they should come to me and ill help them in any way i can because making them better is making our team better
2249229 but im eager to get back to green bay and get things going
2249230 i was freezing it was ridiculous miserable is pretty much the best word i was miserable and just about everybody in the stands was too especially after we lost
2249231 my road to where i am now has been very fulfilling
2249232 i put in a lot of hard work in high school just to get noticed and when i got to cal i waited in the wings behind a really good quarterback reggie robertson before i got my turn

2249234 mr zendejas was shocked and surprised upon being advised of the allegations against him
2249235 he is anxious to begin immediately to defend his good name and he is very grateful and appreciative of the support he has already received from family and friends who know these allegations are simply slanderous
2249236 favre should invest in a waffle house which are as ubiquitous in the south as pickup trucks and mildew
2249237 i think were getting to the point where some of our young leaders are stepping up and enforcing that mentality this is how we work this is how were going to do it
2249238 hopefully well continue to build that team chemistry that is so important
2249239 hes got the physical tools but what sets him apart is his assertiveness and confidence
2249240 i think his greatest physical asset besides his ability to catch is hes got great lower body strength and great quickness
2249241 when you defend him i think hes a guy like michael jordan you say hey hes going to get his we just dont want him to kill us you look at the great ones and they were going to get theirs you try to limit them you are not going to extinguish him you just try to limit how bad he hurts you
2249242 they fear taking responsibility for their life and their actions they fear the unknown
2249243 because then they have no one left to blame even them self they no longer have a choice but to change

2249246 collectors will pretend theyre putting you on hold to plead your case to a manager they act like theyre on your side instead they doodle or go get some more coffee despite creative tactics like this federal law requires collection agents to treat you fairly theyre not allowed to call you before eight in the morning or after nine at night if they know your employer discourages personal calls they are not supposed to call you at work one call a day is the accepted industry standard after a collection company calls you it has five days to mail you a notice stating who you owe how much you owe and what to do if you dispute the debt collectors are not allowed to embarrass you publicly or discuss your debt with anybody else they can call other people only to find out where you are collection agents are not allowed to pretend that theyre with the cops or the courts they cant imply that youve committed a crime or threaten to arrest you and they can get into serious trouble if they use foul language or threaten violence collection agents are not allowed to collect more than you owe if you write a post dated check they cant cash it early if you want a collector to stop calling ask him for his name and address which by law he must provide then send a certified letter demanding that the collector stop calling you after that the collection company can only notify you by mail of specific actions it plans to take against you like lawsuits its as simple as that the debt doesnt go away but the calls do if you believe you do not owe the money you should write the collection agent a letter within 30 days the collector is not allowed to contact you again until your debt is verified and the documentation has been forwarded to you often collection agents are willing to negotiate after all if you dont pay they dont get paid say you owe 300 but you only have 200 if you offer to forward it right away the collector may agree to call it even if your credit record is in terrible shape anyway cutting a deal like this wont make it much worse if in doubt contact a reputable counseling service like consumer credit counseling do your homework 1 if a collection agent calls you remain calm and get his or her name the collection companys name the name of the merchant theyre collecting for and the amount 2 if you dont want a collection agent to call you anymore ask for the companys address send a certified letter asking the company to stop contacting you 3 if you are deep in debt consider negotiating with the collectors who call they may be willing to accept a smaller amount than you actually owe or waive late fees and fines 4 if a collector is overly aggressive or abusive on the phone alert him or her that you are aware of your rights under the fair debt collection practices act just the fact that you know the name of the law should shut them up how to complain if you believe a collection agent is harassing you or violating the law you have the right to sue in a state or federal court within one year of the violation if you simply want to file a complaint contact your state attorney general and the federal trade commission

2249300 if we are now going to choose nuclear power as a way to resolve both our concerns about global warming and our looming energy shortfalls we are first going to have to engage in a national debate about whether or not we accept the technology
2249301 every fuel used in human history firewood coal oil wind and water has been derived from the sun but terrestrial energy is different
2249302 terrestrial energy is the heat at the earths core that raises its temperature to 7 000 degrees fahrenheit hotter than the surface of the sun
2249303 heres a better idea bring the source of this heat the uranium to the surface put it in a carefully controlled environment and accelerate its breakdown a bit to raise temperatures to around 700 degrees fahrenheit and use it to boil water thats what we do in a nuclear reactor
2249304 because the public first became aware of nuclear energy through warfare reactors have always been thought of as

2249321 michael i love your column i read it all the time i just have one comment now that the euro cup is over how do you feel about your prediction that spain would fail in the elimination rounds oh and please feel free to correct my grammar wherever necessary

2249326 i swear to god he looked like a kid whod been in there with r kelly best quote ever
2249327 supriya harris sounds like she would be a good contributor to the yahoo sports team
2249328 why the need to mention the skin color of all non tiger golfers in a lyrical sentence that was obviously designed to be a put down in context i cant imagine what the reprocussions of an altered song that referred to a group of african american athletes as boring and black would be im reasonably certain you would never stoop to find out oh well i guess i shouldnt expect any better out of a media whore im sure many of the tiger fans will find that song a riot
2249329 hey michael ive been reading you for years followed you from si to y since so many people tend to write hate mail i just thought id send a note to tell you how great i thought your rendition of eye of the tiger was in gameface thanks for entertaining this crippled stoner over the years you and se or king are still the best writers in sports peace

2249331 im a 1994 n c state graduate and nearly worship rivers or p riv as we call him as a fan i have had little to cheer for and have adopted the chargers as my afc team since p riv was drafted but he needs to shut up and play ball i cant believe our stoic leader that we watched pummel ncaa defenses for four years has to run his mouth to get fired up in fact i think it makes him play worse and i find myself making excuses to all those annoying tar heel fans whove always hated him so rivers from a bro shut up and throw the ball you do it so well
2249332 hi michael i sat in the second row right behind the chargers bench at their season finale in oakland this past season and it was quite interesting rivers was very distracted by the fans merriman seemed to lecture him about it lt didnt seem too pleased with him either early on i got him to look over and stare me down by shouting hey rivers youre even worse than eli it really was that easy to get into his head
2249333 funny to hear you talking about mouthing off and rants when you take your column supposedly devoted to sports and always ensure to get in a sophomoric leftist dig at those you dont agree with politically methinks the kettle is calling either the pot or the river black
2249334 michael ive always appreciated your lyric altered song feature but youve outdone yourself for you to take a song like bushs everything zen and actually make it

2249361 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
2249362 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
2249363 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
2249364 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
2249365 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
2249366 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
2249367 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
2249368 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
2249369 who are open to doing something on the production side
2249370 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
2249371 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
2249372 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them

2249386 the basic idea has merit trains use less energy per passenger mile than jet airplanes especially on shorter trips even a major switch wouldnt make a huge dent in national oil use or cut total energy consumption but an improved rail system could cut use of oil substantially electrically driven trains can run on no oil coal and nuclear power
2249387 sadly most of amtraks current system doesnt help cut either energy or oil use much amtrak was conceived in a political process as a nationwide passenger railroad network as implemented that resulted in a series of daily or less than daily long haul trains traveling at less than highway or less than 1948 rail speeds each carrying at best the equivalent of maybe two 737s full of people
2249388 where amtrak does do well is in the northeast corridor its frequent and relatively high speed trains between new york and washington command a significant and growing share of the market
2249389 there is really only one way to put it atlanta is becoming whiter and at a pace that outstrips the rest of the nation the white share of the citys population says brookings institution demographer william frey grew faster between 2000 and 2006 than that of any other u s city it increased from 31 percent in 2000 to 35 percent in 2006 a numeric gain of 26 000 more than double the increase between 1990 and 2000 the trend seems to be gathering strength with each passing year only washington d c saw a comparable increase in white population share during those years although several other big cities are starting to see it now
2249390 as officials step up efforts to beautify beijing especially along the olympic torch relay route where the shop is located the yu family and their neighbors are left to wait worry and appeal for sympathy
2249391 more than 1 25 million people in beijing at times as many as 13 000 people a week have been evicted since the city won its olympic bid in 2001 according to the geneva based center on housing rights and evictions
2249392 these residents are facing an issue that surfaces in every olympics gentrification in the name of improving a citys image but in china where the government is clamping down hard on anything that incites instability those trying to fend off what appears to be inevitable have fewer options and face greater risk
2249393 tumbling house prices in america rising foreclosures and a glut of unsold homes have produced a variety of unusual even desperate responses from policymakers of the 129m housing units in america 18 6m stand empty at 2 9 the home owner vacancy rate which measures the share of vacant homes for sale has reached its highest point since measurement began in 1956 at the end of the first quarter there were 2 3m empty homes on the market an increase of more than 160 000 from the end of 2007 there is a vicious circle the huge number of houses on the market pushes home prices down and as prices decrease mortgages become harder to refinance leading to more foreclosures vacancies and so on the more homes are on the market the less chance that prices will stabilise
2249394 you either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain

2249396 the access to the scaffold was across fragile materials which presented another significant danger to the worker
2249397 our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure it is our light not our darkness that most frightens us we ask ourselves who am i to be brilliant gorgeous talented and fabulous actually who are you not to be you are a child of god your playing small doesnt help the world theres nothing enlightening about shrinking down so someone wont feel insecure around you we were born to make manifest the glory of god however you believe in the creator my words that is within us it is not just in some of us it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine we unconsciously give others the permission to do the same as we are liberated from our own fear our presence automatically liberates others

2249429 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice

2249431 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

2249459 there is a danger of the chinese perceiving the world as a bad guest at their olympics intensely proud of what they see as a glorious national achievement and the symbolic emergence of their nation on the world stage many people would feel a lasting resentment if outside views were solely negative for very many chinese the games will be their first experience of the outside world engaging with a formerly closed society can only encourage greater openness and freedom and this legacy will not be easily suppressed when the games are over equally it is sobering and to many thrilling to realise that in 17 days time all talk of the next olympics will refer to london britain would do well to watch study and learn from beijing who now can tell what fevered talk will fill the air in london four years from now but for beijing the long wait is over let the games begin
2249460 awarding the olympic games to china was a disgrace for which the functionaries of the olympic committee are responsible their claim that they do not want to interfere in politics is cynical and hypocritical respecting human rights is a universal norm of civilisation that only communists and fascists fail to observe we do not condemn the athletes who participate in the olympics they did not choose the location but we are expressing our displeasure with all those politicians who by their very presence in beijing regardless of their verbal statements are supporting a dictatorial state above all we want to show our solidarity with all those who are being deprived of their freedom and fundamental rights in china we are convinced that any dictatorship even that of a powerful state must be condemned
2249461 i think that what has been said and done in the past year could have a lasting impact a well known example of this is how beijing afraid that a widespread boycott could ruin the celebrations toned down its opposition to international involvement in darfur but more important in my opinion are all the looks that have turned towards china looks that would otherwise have been turned elsewhere as a result it is no longer possible to talk of chinas economic miracle without mentioning human rights and the destruction of the environment the other side of the coin has become more visible to all thanks to the olympic games the chinese leadership did not reckon with this when it rejoiced over the decision to award the games to beijing
2249462 was it really necessary for nicolas sarkozy as current eu president to brush aside all doubts so quickly and promise his symbolic presence at the opening ceremony the majority of french believe otherwise and this is no doubt a consequence of the fact that none of the conditions that sarkozy set for beijing have been fulfilled particularly regarding tibet and we should also recall that after heated debate in the european parliament sarkozy had planned to bring a list of political prisoners to the games what a waste of time and effort
2249463 at the end of the 19th century when the olympic games were reintroduced no once could have guessed where the olympic idea would take us for example tug of war and fire extinguishing were important disciplines back then today the games have become a global project huge sums of money are spent in organising them even though with a budget of 40 billion dollars the chinese have set an example that will be hard to follow sport has now been eclipsed by a political economic and cultural campaign aimed at showing the world how modern and how open to the world china has become no one knows where the upper limit lies but the fact is that the budgets for organising the olympic games will soon be impossible to top even now the struggle between the rich countries to stage the games resembles a tug of war
2249464 when you buy eggs from factory farms they contain antibiotics pesticides hormones you should not be eating those eggs
2249465 put it this way you wouldnt knowingly fry them for breakfast
2249466 we feed our pigs the best possible wheatgerm the best milk the best soya yet people feed their children rubbish funny isnt it
2249467 all supermarkets take it as accepted that they will pay the lowest price on the day there is no other mechanism for them buyers cannot buck the trend
2249468 we are just about all on wvlt because their people look better and it will be ut football time very soon
2249469 verily who is this child that he opens our hearts and minds to the audacity of hope
2249470 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2249471 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
2249472 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
2249473 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
2249474 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
2249475 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
2249476 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
2249477 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
2249478 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
2249479 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
2249480 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
2249481 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
2249482 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
2249483 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
2249484 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
2249485 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
2249486 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
2249487 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

2249490 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
2249491 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
2249492 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
2249493 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
2249494 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
2249495 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
2249496 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
2249497 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
2249498 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
2249499 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
2249500 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
2249501 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
2249502 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
2249503 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
2249504 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
2249505 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
2249506 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
2249507 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
2249508 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
2249509 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence

2249552 canker sores may be caused by a faulty immune system that uses the bodys defenses against disease to attack and destroy the normal cells of the mouth or tongue
2249553 based on our findings regarding the risk of sustaining an injury when hit by a batted ball we strongly recommend helmets with face shields or at least mouth guards and eye protection be used by all pitchers infielders and batters at the high school level
2249554 the use of face guards among batters is becoming more accepted in youth baseball
2249555 however the use of proven protective equipment such as face shields mouth guards and eye protection is not yet widely accepted by players and coaches at the high school level research shows that wearing such protective equipment reduces the risk of sports related facial and dental injuries

2249559 barrosos conduct does not throw a good light on the commission obviously this authority regards the european unions budget as its own private budget instead of striving to make the community cut its costs and return unused funds to the member states it is thinking of ways to spend them one can always find a good cause but experience has taught us that the member states must impose tight limits on the commissions urge to set up new programmes take over new powers and spend money otherwise there is the danger that the authority undermines the right of the member states to stipulate the eu budget so the first task in hand is to defend a well founded principle
2249560 it appears to me that this difference is proof that europes most important economic paper is indeed able to distinguish between what is relevant and what is banal between a declaration of political and economic significance and demagogical trivialities between an expression of strong leadership and the lack of such merkel is a clear example of a reformer a reform oriented politician goes two steps ahead and openly explains the situation to society without attempting to conceal the difficulties and the costs involved a populist politician on the other hand first tries to keep the problem under wraps then plays it down and then keeps quiet about the costs
2249561 it will be far more difficult to overcome the breach that this surreal procedure has sparked the party is divided on the one hand is the old guard from the days under gerhard schr der who support clement and the partys 2010 reform agenda on the other is the impatient new radical wing what is at stake is the leadership of the party and the ultimate verdict on the schr der era andrea ypsilanti has broken a taboo she established contacts with die linke against the wishes of her party and hopes with their support to oust the conservatives and become state premier that would indeed be an earthquake for german politics and for the spd

2249564 in the past eight years political integration in the eu has come to a standstill the last major reform was carried out under the auspices of the treaty of nice 2000 apparently the current system for decision making within the eu is unable to provide adequate responses to global problems and this only fuels euro pessimism european integration has reached its limits under the current system in its present form it cannot progress any further the system of eu institutions is appallingly complex and lacking in transparency and eu citizens are quite right to reject it the time has come to make a great leap forwards the current political ufo should be transformed into a genuine federation german or us federalism could serve as a model it must be clear which powers lie with the federal government and which belong to the states it is indispensable that we create a federalist system if we want a competitive eu europes citizens have rejected both the so called constitutional treaty and the treaty of lisbon why should they say yes to a federal europe because there is no alternative
2249565 the arrest of radovan karad i the former political leader of the bosnian serbs should give new impetus to the process of eu accession the eu has given priority status to the accession of the countries of former yugoslavia and neighbouring albania eu expansion in the western balkans is viewed by europeans as the best means of securing stability and development in the region according to experts at the think tank in brussels the difficulty for the european union consists in balancing two strategies the first is maintaining order in a region which is not yet entirely peaceful the other is securing the transition of the western balkans to europe to permit a true europeanisation of the western balkans the union must demonstrate its unflinching commitment yet both sides harbour doubts as far as the political will of the other is concerned the time has come to dispel these doubts we must speak clearly to establish mutual trust and make the european perspective a reality for the countries of this region as soon as possible

2249567 the military putsch which has ousted the mauritanian president sidi mohamed ould cheikh abdallahi and the prime minister yahia ould ahmed el ouakef puts an abrupt end to the promising process of democratisation in this impoverished african country and this is lamentable in every respect spain has numerous interests in this neighbouring country for example joint control of fishing and illegal immigration political instability in this country is bad news because our policy in the north african region largely depends on there being the greatest possible stability there to propel the economic development of its society
2249568 if we are now set for a prolonged period of modest or negative returns from housing then this should encourage a more rational allocation of household wealth people will think more seriously about the attractions of renting rather than owning their home with a larger and more active rental sector of the housing market people will be freer to move home in order to take up attractive new jobs for which they are suited there will consequently be fewer people who commute long distances to work that will lessen the burden to them and reduce the costs to the environment those who have invested heavily in property have not been greedy they have made rational decisions given the bias in our economy to owner occupation that bias has real costs and there should be few tears if it is now passing
2249569 the cuts of over a billion euros mean a drastic restriction of the activities of the culture ministry even before the cuts the culture budget was one of the lowest in europe at 0 28 percent of the gdp anyone who voices concern at this measure is accused of etatism meanwhile however our neighbours are forming their own judgements which will be pitiless yet behind every word lies a wholehearted love for italy and its culture not only do the budget cuts put the future of our cultural heritage at risk they also badly damage our countrys image

2249770 but they were won over once the eggs started coming sometimes i feel we are supplying the whole neighbourhood with eggs
2249771 people who keep chickens find that they are thinking about things that never really occurred to them before about where their food comes from
2249772 they begin to distrust food from a supermarket and they also do more baking because they have the eggs
2249773 older people remember them from their childhood and there is a lot of nostalgia involved in the idea of retiring to the good life in the countryside
2249774 if i go into a garden where there arent hens i feel there is something missing its two dimensional no colour movement and drama

2249785 i obtained a pistol for the purpose of target shooting in the early 90s
2249786 after the initial fascination wore off i resold the pistol and bought my first telescope as my interest in astronomy grew and the opportunity to buy some real observational equipment meant that i could put my spare time to better use increasing my knowledge of the night sky instead of just punching holes in paper targets
2249787 its not unusual for people who grow up around guns to retain an interest in them after their initial exposure
2249788 coming from an unstable situation in my own country where i was exposed to an underground gun culture that arose in defense of neighborhoods that i grew up in and being mechanically minded i was drawn to the unique mechanical systems of guns
2249789 when i was fighting my extradition case back in the mid 90s this gun charge was dealt with by u s district court judge charles legge who found that i had only obtained the said pistol for sporting purposes
2249790 he gave me six months time served for the offense thats where i thought it ended apparently not
2249791 since the 1996 immigration reforms the big crackdown has been on criminal aliens
2249792 every year were setting records for the number of people deported the last couple of years its been around 200 000 a year
2249793 and in some ways the fear of terrorism the fear of criminal aliens fits in nicely with the long history of our response some would say over response to the perceived immigration threat of the day
2249794 immigrants who are in the country who have committed crimes and the laws have become harsher and harsher tougher and tougher
2249795 if youve got one conviction maybe you can avoid deportation if youve got two convictions its harder
2249796 and if youve got a firearms conviction its going to be very very tough to stay
2249797 i was living quite normally and moving forward before all this happened in january
2249798 i feel that in the circumstances that im in now the gun issue is being used in a more punitive way than in other ways it would have been

2249817 we welcome the iauc as official sponsors for our august f ile and we value their involvement in this years festival this year has been particularly difficult with massive cuts to our funding however we have come through many years of hardship and yet we always managed to not only survive but also thrive this year is no exception
2249818 we wanted to showcase this community initiative and to recognize the important role the f ile has played in promoting peace building and intergenerational participation at the local level for the past twenty years
2249819 we are hoping that through our involvement with the festival and our recognition of local efforts in the north of ireland we might strengthen the ties between irish americans and irish communities particularly those who are moving the peace process on the ground forward daily in historically marginalized areas it is in these areas where the foundations for a secure and lasting peace will be built

2249831 they have tremendous potential if they look at it in the context of the oceanfront
2249832 we think that investment in the oceanfront as investment in town center and princess anne commons returns on itself to the community
2249833 this project would be the springboard of redevelopment for that whole area
2249834 it would create upscale users who want to be around and in the 17th street corridor the 19th street corridor and the birdneck road corridor activity breeds activity

2249838 you are invited to attend a public hearing regarding a 14 bed residential treatment facility location to be 1270 cr 2293 cleveland tx 77327 liberty county tarkington isd
2249839 we feel this facility is being slipped by the community
2249840 they havent canvassed any of the neighbors to see if they wanted to be friendly neighbors
2249841 we know the need for a juvenile treatment facility is there
2249842 but its not going to benefit our community these kids are going to come from all over
2249843 our school district is going to be liable for their education
2249844 would put an unfair burden on our small school district as our district would be required to educate these children
2249845 if they come with 14 regular ed students it wouldnt be a problem if they have 14 special ed students well have to hire staff
2249846 one of the school board members called the superintendent of schools called mr wheeler called and a lady called to ask if i had a website but thats it
2249847 everybodys got the option to call me if they call me we could defuse the situation
2249848 im trying to name an emotional disorder maybe depression or anxiety would qualify
2249849 its a matter of public record what im licensed for i understand that people would see my name as a therapy provider for sex offenders and think im going to bring sex offenders to their community but thats not what im doing
2249850 you dont really know what type of child youre getting in advance
2249851 my objective was to look for a wholesome rural environment and remove them the children to be placed with the facility from a chaotic environment
2249852 the quiet underhanded way in which this facility has been planned is very disturbing
2249853 was bought as a weekender and it was used as a weekender then i thought why not do something meaningful with my practice and do something more fulfilling
2249854 having known the former owners we know for a fact there have been problems with the well and septic system
2249855 my well and septic system are in good working order and the water has been tested
2249856 i dont have the technical background to tell you the specifics but i have been told that they are in good working order
2249857 i wasnt trying to slip something in the community i sent letters to the sheriff the superintendent of schools the police chief the fire chief a high school guidance counselor a commissioner it was six or seven officials
2249858 you have all these good intentions and then you have a public hearing at the end and the dam breaks
2249859 if the community is so worried about boys ill get girls
2249860 if they live here were going to take care of them i just may have to go out and find people to take care of them
2249861 oppose the location of such a facility at any other address in the tarkington independent school district
2249862 im not concerned about whats there now im worried about what will be there next year

2249889 it argues for other ways of dealing with salvation for infants who died unbaptized
2249890 it shows that benedict is not afraid to look at something that has been taught in the church for centuries and say it is not at the core of catholic belief
2249891 puts the catholic church in a different position than protestant evangelicals who teach if you do not have a conscious explicit relationship with christ born again you cannot be saved

2249944 it was such a moving experience it felt so similar to reading a great work of literature
2249945 all of the human emotions and experiences are right there in this dictionary just as they would be in any fine work of literature they just happen to be alphabetized
2249946 wonderful words that are kind of hidden in the depths of the english vocabulary that we dont come across
2249947 ive always loved that smell when it first starts raining
2249948 now i dont talk about that word so much but i do think about it when i come across that particular kind of gentle smell wafting off the ground
2249949 i love the tactile sensation of turning one page to the next and feeling my fingers across them i love having the weight of the book in my lap i like the way that books smell thats a huge part of it
2249950 i had a brief feeling of euphoria i danced a brief jig in the library basement

2249996 it doesnt translate into the choreography or the theme of the show but it translates into the tricks and acts themselves and the level of training
