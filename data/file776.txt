7760121 what sets adolf loos apart from other masters of the modern house is his total separation of interior from exterior space
7760122 his interiors are completely isolated from the outside windows are merely sources of light and the occupants turn their backs on them focused only towards the internal spaces
7760123 this seems to make loos the tormented poet architect of modern mans repressed soul and on this basis he has been much analysed by critics
7760124 president klaus weakened the czech republics position four months before the country will take over the eu rotating presidency when the disunited foreign policy will have a very negative impact on world public opinion and especially on the public opinion in europe

7760126 i think it is really fatal and bad that russia not only decided to intervene in ossetia but it has intervened within georgia and remains there

7760131 i think with british ingenuity wit and resourcefulness we are going to produce a games an opening ceremony a closing ceremony and all the stuff in between that is going to be in our own sweet way just as fantastic
7760132 i am absolutely determined to make sure that we come in under the 9 3bn i have no reason to think that we will have any difficulty in doing that
7760133 i will ensure that london taxpayers and indeed british taxpayers do not pay a penny more
7760134 we are going to have a wonderful games and i can assure you all my team is working very hard to make sure that we protect value for london taxpayers and that people coming to london will enjoy themselves
7760135 we do need to be firm on this we cant allow the olympic delivery authority or whoever else involved with the games simply to try and hold taxpayers to ransom
7760136 the games are for the athletes the games are not for london the games are not for great britain
7760137 they are going to have a fantastic olympic village in which to spend their time during the games
7760138 in the long term those 3 000 units we are building in east london are going to be a vital part of the legacy we want to see out of the olympic games thats why it would be completely senseless to economise

7760420 literally the only thing had to be hulk had to be in it and wolverine had to be in it

7760458 theres a saying if youre not failing then youre not trying hard enough and thats what we try to go for

7760462 many times documents are printed when they could really be dealt with in digital form
7760463 we can work with customers to show them how to build systems that actually reduce the volume of paper in their organisation
7760464 the savings that can be made in organisations is significant
7760465 youll never get rid of paper totally but through efficient planning you can reduce the volume
7760466 the same approach can work for things like letterhead documents and forms
7760467 printing these things as needed means that lots of pre printed sheets wont go out of date and have to be thrown away
7760468 it might sound counter intuitive coming from a printing company but the more you reduce physical output the more benefits you get in cost and reducing the environmental impact
7760469 its true that you can always refill or recycle cartridges but not having anything to recycle is even better
7760470 there is little doubt that placing the responsibility on manufacturers for the collection and cost of recycling e waste will give them a strong incentive to design products that are easier to de manufacture consume fewer materials and reduce harmful content

7760480 you have to really be true to the comic books themselves
7760481 i went back and i looked at and read the comic books and i looked at them and i looked at them you have to find a way of speaking you have to find a way of not feeling kind of corny with some of the stuff
7760482 alan cumming as nightcrawler i would have loved a crack at that so when it finally comes along if one finally comes along you treat it with a great deal of respect and we did
7760483 hes coming to the end of his time in the field
7760484 the battle which he loves its coming to an end what he gets is a glimpse of a possible kind of expansion to that no only that expansion but a bigger better version of it he figures out that if he can get his hands on this chemical then he doesnt have to answer to anybody

7760486 because a lot of my stuff in the film is running running and jumping
7760487 the incredible hulk smashes harrys brain into undulating geek neurons firing on the possibilities ahead of us
7760488 the incredible hulk is unquestionably one of the more compelling screen adaptations from the comic book realm
7760489 3 stars the incredible hulk provides marvel with its second superhero hit of the summer
7760490 this new production starring edward norton as bruce banner looks a lot better sometimes it looks great and its a thunderously efficient enterprise with a nice surprise at the very end
7760491 everything you want in a hulk film nothing you dont
7760492 cleverly re imagined as a film noir it is a dark and shadowy piece full of monsters only some of them green
7760493 theres enough adrenaline pulsating throughout this bang up marvel comics adaptation to erase 2003s hulk from memory
7760494 a classic comic book hero quest that while not entirely novel hews to its own rules and conventions with dignity and artfulness
7760495 its loud and in your face and it does maintain the same
7760496 4 stars big loud messy and most of all fun the incredible hulk offers more evidence that when done right the comic book hero story can indeed be well super
7760497 b a potent mix of testosterone and adrenalin and action fans of all ages should be happy to hand over their green
7760498 tim roth could give bad guy clinics but he mines new veins of skill in hulk
7760499 it turns out marvel studios knows how to make solid movies out of marvel comics
7760500 what seemed in theory the least necessary revival of a bigscreen superhero emerges as perfectly solid summer action fare in
7760501 on june 13 the incredible hulk smashes its way into theaters
7760502 the reality is that norton and roth both play the hell out of the movie and have you invested in their characters so when theyre cg creatures you still picture norton and roth and carry that baggage with you
7760503 morphing into the hideous abomination the overly ambitious blonsky faces off against the hulk in a harlem showdown tearing up the hood in a masterfully choreographed awesome showdown
7760504 the ending battle between the hulk and abomination is one of the most spectacular and exciting things ive ever seen on screen
7760505 its a visual feast for the eyes and an absolute smashing good time from start to end
7760506 with the incredible hulk leterrier has created a movie on a par with jon favreaus iron man one thats only comparable to the last hulk movie in that the two are nothing alike
7760507 second film in 5 years boasts better special effects and a smashing foe
7760508 the incredible hulk stars lending their voices to the making of the upcoming
7760509 it has to be said that this jolly green giant looks pretty darn good
7760510 so has it been worth resurrecting the worlds fourth most popular superhero for another go
7760511 who better to play such a multi faceted hulk than the versatile norton an actor who lives to play complex characters
7760512 im impressed by the realism of the interaction between hulk and physical objects and the actual human stuntwork has looked excellent
7760513 lots of special effects lots of badass fight scenes guns bullets monsters and lovely women how is that not a recipe for success
7760514 norton may be an inspired choice to play brainy scientist bruce banner grappling with inner and outer conflict
7760515 tim roth has resided brilliantly in the realm of indie cinema but now the oscar nominee is hitting the mainstream in
7760516 i can say with all confidence that this looks like another example of marvel done right
7760517 if the filmmakers promised mash up of the tortured on the run jekyl and hyde hero of the 70s tv series and the balls out gamma powered beat downs of the comic book incarnations is as effective as it is intriguing theres every reason to believe ol jade jaw may be reeling in giant fistfuls of green at the cineplex
7760518 it is as if marvel has found their niche making intelligent well developed superhero movies
7760519 this version of hulk will definitely kick a bunch of ass
7760520 edward norton whose struggles to deal with rage made him famous in fight club and american history x is the perfect choice to play an ordinary guy with an all consuming alter ego
7760521 it is hard to tell who is more badass in the new trailer for the incredible hulk
7760522 the footage we saw proved this flick is going in an entirely different direction a run fight kick ass sorta direction
7760523 the big green guy looks great sounds great and is definitely bad ass
7760524 mama ik wil ook eens een keer met jou naar het circus olijt

7760552 this is yet another example of a seemingly trusted organisation appearing to be sloppy with peoples personal information people are entitled to wonder why they are constantly being told about the importance of protecting personal information when large organisations dont seem to follow the same rules themselves
7760553 crews immediately started treating the child and very quickly took him to birmingham childrens hospital two additional paramedics travelled with the ambulance crew to provide additional assistance

7760563 make it as much about the characters as about the visual effects frankly ive just been waiting for us to finish the incredible hulk so we can show it to people
7760564 if we compare the first hulk ang lees hulk to star trek the motion picture i wanted the next hulk to be comparable to the wrath of khan he said
7760565 which is not only more bombastic and more action oriented and entertaining but at the same time has characterizations that are even more recognizable to what fans were expecting
7760566 it didnt take us long to look at our roster and realize wait a minute iron man hulk thor captain america the last two are to be released in 2010 and 2011 respectively its the avengers and thats clearly by design
7760567 the road to the avengers is what im most excited about im also excited about watching what happens when these four or five very different personalities are forced to sit together in one room
7760568 it shows that the marvel universe is connected and that each of the heroes is not by themselves they are part of a bigger universe the marvel characters didnt evolve individually they evolved together as a group
7760569 he and his little buddies dw and carlos may have the names grades and locations of the problems a little mixed up

7760589 the recent meeting of the southern african development community sadc in johannesburg despite the report by its own observers on electoral malpractices has in effect accepted mugabe as the president of zimbabwe with the honorable exceptions of botswana and zambia we are dismayed that sadc is still betraying our people by not acknowledging their vote we ask whether you would be prepared to accept a petition to pass on to the relevant eu authority briefly the petition calls on eu governments to suspend government to government aid to sadc members until they abide by their commitment to uphold human rights in the region we are not referring of course to humanitarian aid but to balance of payment support we do not see why for instance the british taxpayer should contribute 70 million a year to malawi whose president has been given a stolen zimbabwe farm and has named a highway in malawi after robert mugabe we want the money saved to be used to finance refugee camps in the countries bordering zimbabwe where zimbabweans can seek a haven from starvation violence and collapsing health and education systems we are anxious that our people should not be an imposition on our neighbours prompting further xenophobic violence the petition has been signed by people passing the zimbabwe vigil which has been held outside the zimbabwe embassy in london every saturday for the last six years in support of free and fair elections in zimbabwe we will send copies of the petition to eu and sadc member countries but we hope you can help to get this project underway we could either present this petition to you at the vigil or a place of your own choosing

7760595 i personally design the layout and select the colours every month to prove that being political does not mean dull this alone should attract readers
7760596 i handle most of the work which is very satisfying and challenging
7760597 i applied online is there anything else i should do
7760598 no solamente debemos decir que amamos sino que debemos demostrarlo por medio de lo que hacemos
7760599 if pushed for a definition i would say middle class starts when you are no longer entitled to certain social benefits such as grants health insurance or housing assistance and ends when the fiscal scale gradually changes from progressive to proportional
7760600 the category is therefore very disparate socially and politically and when ones at the bottom it doesnt take much to drop into the lower category
7760601 but it takes time for them to have an effect whats more the inflation correction for direct federal tax is not complete
7760602 growth does not depend only on consumers consuming but also on companies investing exports and government spending
7760603 as a result higher wages hurt competitiveness and exports and slow down investments

7760608 with any situation that occurs of that scale or even smaller we always step back and take a minute to assess and see if there is anything we should do differently
7760609 but every year were evaluating what we do and we continue to work on how we can improve our educational outreach to students none of that has changed we had a good working policy in place
7760610 students said they would support 40 to 65 a semester
7760611 well invite students from various constituencies sororities and fraternities athletics student housing off campus housing to get different views about what works where safety is concerned
7760612 you know bad things can happen and you try your best to be prepared and to educate students what to do in case of threats or violent behavior
7760613 but if youre asking me because of one abnormal act do we now change everything we do id say no because weve been training residence hall assistants for five years on roommate issues and we have good policies and practices in place
7760614 this was a property crime complaint there was no threat of violence she wasnt a flight risk and we knew where she was
7760615 its the closest thing to living in a big city
7760616 its more spacious than i thought for the record my friends are going to be jealous
7760617 this adds to the middle gap in that its rental and not condo
7760618 theres high end and low end downtown but we have a deficit in the middle one north fifth is a big move in that direction
7760619 i paid exactly the same price as in philadelphia and i get a bigger apartment and a nice view its a new place its right next to the transportation center
7760620 it had a dingy prisonlike feel to it we took out as many walls as we could it completely opened up the space
7760621 taking the concrete balcony off opens it from the outside and lets more light in
7760622 thats the biggest thing theyre not deterred by a lot of the normal stuff
7760623 people that have already been through redevelopment can see what it takes to make something happen
7760624 there is still great skepticism to downtown among local developers i visited with homer williams he told me the pearl district was in worse condition 20 years ago than our downtown
7760625 i think at the time in 2006 a lot of people looking at projects were blinded by rising residential prices and building costs if you thought about it and unfortunately nobody thought about it except williams amp dame theres a dramatic need for affordable rental housing
7760626 the big part of that is its apartments not condos
7760627 most developers here dont understand the concept of building a community
7760628 williams amp dame understand the fact its not just one project out here everybody thinks of a 1 to 3 year process its a 10 to 20 year process
7760629 they identified the one type of project that could be done in this type of market
7760630 they have a long term vision for the area it worked for them more than it might for others
7760631 the air force has increased the sheer volume of pilots put through the training pipeline and shipped them off to war with the bare minimum training required
7760632 the agenda of speakers for wordcamp portland is out and im the keynote speaker and i need your help i will be talking about how wordpress is changing lives not just from the blogging experience but truly changing your life from stem to stern wordpress and wordpress com free blogs give a voice to those who may never have had the chance to express themselves with wordpress they have the chance to be heard i want to honor those people
7760633 i had breakfast with bryan of urbandrinks yesterday and he showed me something that might change your life
7760634 dont make me angry you wouldnt like me when im angry
7760635 and i sorta wrote a plotline that didnt start in the beginning as respect to angs movie i didnt want the same thing the same origin story
7760636 in my version hes already the hulk well make it a super hero movie thats not your typical super hero movie with an origin
7760637 im so afraid and in love with cg at the same time
7760638 this was my first cg movie so i didnt want to be the guy who loves cg but fails miserably i love to use real cameras and real camera angles i dont like to use cg cameras to fly around it made it a little bit quite a bit difficult
7760639 reading all the comic books all the things that i really discovered and fell in love with it was almost like i was flirting with the character
7760640 i fell in love reading the comics and i was like this is amazing
7760641 i couldnt include everything i wanted but yes it was important that i was a fan making a movie for the fans
7760642 when you do it for the general audience you specify for the fans and then within this you find possibly the ideal hulk movie which is like a good balance between everything
7760643 the team has lost i have always felt that he worked on his images
7760644 the saga of a scapegoat not an underdog kps gill
7760645 the man one of the deceased wanted to go with the soldier but he was annoyed prompting him to pick his gun and shoot the girl and the boys at the bar
7760646 it is unfortunate for the killing but we shall follow this issue until a compensation of the victims is done
7760647 even slight drop in the rankings can put a low school deans job in jeopardy
7760648 even a slight drop in the rankings can put a law school deans job in jeopardy especially during a tough market for graduating lawyers

7760651 the merger with grey wolf is a perfect strategic fit for both companies
7760652 together we can deliver high value services that will provide significant value to our customers employees and security holders
7760653 they certainly dont want to burn any bridges with grey wolf they certainly know that theres some key guys there that are very important to the grey wolf company that theyd want to keep around

7760655 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul
7760656 this man wishes to be accorded the same privilege as a sponge he wishes to think
7760657 i become fearful when i see people substituting fear for reason
7760658 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
7760659 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
7760660 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
7760661 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
7760662 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny

7760675 a peculiar tenderness for animals and the intensity needed to act on the animals behalf when people abuse them
7760676 having run in crowds where animal abuse was rampant often involving pit bull fights the men volunteered at shelters and the american society for the prevention of cruelty toward animals and they tried to solve cases of missing or abused animals that other organizations had neither the time nor the resources to address
7760677 next month the bikers will begin a program in the citys public schools to educate children about being kind to all animals even the less attractive breeds they will be accompanied by elwood a small hairless chihuahua mix judged in an annual california contest to be the worlds ugliest dog

7760682 we dont think that parade is going to enhance our image as the arts and cultural capital of new zealand
7760683 we dont want to make a big fuss over this event it isnt the type of high quality event we want wellington to be known for
7760684 most of our 1000 or so members would probably be happier if the event did not proceed but if it does we dont want the huge focus on it that was created by the controversy in auckland this year
7760685 we suspect that many auckland businesses likewise dont see the auckland parade doing much for aucklands brand either
7760686 we wont do anything until the court of appeals rules
7760687 but it was too small to take the ball out we had to prop our foot on the wall when we took the ball out
7760688 he was very strict but he was a good teacher and a good principal
7760689 when you have a limited event opportunity like this to put out a set of iron man cards you really want it to click on all cylinders
7760690 in all the projects ive ever worked on ive never had a movie card set where there was so much special effects material that really enabled us to tell the whole story from start to finish
7760691 marvel studios positioned us to be able to do as much with this iron man card series as we possibly could
7760692 co mingle the history of iron man with the movie
7760693 what made sense to me was not only making a set of cards for the movie itself but also combining some elements from the comic books
7760694 a lot of people who are interested in the movie have been reading iron man comics for years
7760695 we were able to get authentic pieces of the red and gold mark 1 and iron monger suits that we were able to cut up and mount on prop cards
7760696 those become very desirable cards its almost impossible for anyone to have anything like that it makes for a really really cool collectible item
7760697 iron man was always a favorite of mine growing up i had a collection of iron man comics as a kid
7760698 as much as i love working on all the projects that we work on having had the chance to actually put together for work an iron man related card set was a true labor of love
7760699 basically its like planet of the cats there mustve been 500 of them all living in harmony

7760747 i think its discouraging when youre telling a 9 year old youre too good at something
7760748 the whole objective in life is to find something youre good at and stick with it id rather he spend all his time on the baseball field than idolizing someone standing on the street corner

7760773 the best case scenario is people collect their things and leave
7760774 well do our best to resolve the situation with the least police involvement
7760775 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7760776 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7760777 the greatest legacy kennedy would want would be an obama victory in november
7760778 people are trying to fit her somewhere in their minds and in this array of images we have in our culture about african american women as the vixen or the mammy or the angry black woman
7760779 but she doesnt fit any of the molds so she is kind of unsettling to a lot of people she is something new
7760780 imagine seeing her in the white house just the picture of her on the lawn with her two girls
7760781 in deep ways and superficial ways it would be a dramatic shift
7760782 for some people she is supposed to represent a woman who is more traditional in her approach to the office of first lady and be somebody to do the requisite entertaining and look after her husband
7760783 but some feel like the first lady should be more of an activist in the model of eleanor roosevelt or hillary clinton
7760784 uwmc history professor says biden a good pick for obamas running mate
7760785 the campaign in which the vice presidency did make a difference was in 1960 when lyndon johnson was on the kennedy ticket and johnson brought texas into the democratic column
7760786 he biden may make people feel more comfortable with obama because he brings that foreign policy expertise to the ticket
7760787 i think that romneys expertise in the area of foreign policy or at least his background in the private sector and in business and on economic issues is going to be an important factor in the selection of a vice president
7760788 obama hope of audacity means race isnt about losing liberals
7760789 enormous ability to arouse the intense admiration and affection of his base
7760790 exactly what he means by change hope and transformation all the sort of big payoff words that appear in his speeches he has yet to clearly define
7760791 i see him as having a rhetoric rather than a philosophy
7760792 i have said repeatedly that i think that the death penalty should be applied in very narrow circumstances for the most egregious of crimes
7760793 i think the rape of a small child 6 or 8 years old is a heinous crime
7760794 basically conventions are now made for the media carefully choreographed staged events intended to promote the candidate and the party on the national stage as the real election season kicks off
7760795 with their new function it makes more sense to have them as close as possible to the general election
7760796 obamas pick taking the measure of joe biden the longtime senator and democrats choice for vp
7760797 the role of the attack dog is something he is quite comfortable with
7760798 i cant wait to hear michelles speech i will tell you that i did get a little preview of the video they did of her and she was extraordinary
7760799 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling during her nominating loss to barack obama
7760800 let there be no mistake about it we are united clinton said on the eve of her appearance after new whispers of tension between the two democratic giants emerged on the first day of the party convention
7760801 hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7760802 we understand that some in the news media are more interested in reporting the rumor of controversy than the fact of unity obamas top strategist david axelrod and senior clinton aide maggie williams said in a joint statement
7760803 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention and will continue to do so they said
7760804 i told them you are a visiting pastor so it is ok and they expect that you would be involved
7760805 my mother was a communist my father was a communist thats why im a communist im a communist im a communist im a communist
7760806 stop come back here we listened to you and now it is time for you to listen to the word of god
7760807 at funerals it is too late to preach to the deceased so i will preach to the living
7760808 where he leads me i will follow what he feeds me i will swallow
7760809 maam maam can you hear me do you know who you are
7760810 no problem the driver replied most probably you have eaten something wrong in one of those tourist restaurants they delibrately give you bad food there so that if you get sick you stay longer
7760811 how does that work when they check and we have an unreserved ticket
7760812 when the conductor comes you have to pay some extra and that is it maybe 70 roepies extra
7760813 a matter of culture and what you are used to
7760814 hahahaha for my wife and me i only payed 70 roepies so 35 each
7760815 its going to be very interesting indeed where the credibility stakes now hang in this place in terms of those opposite and their behaviour in the senate as they begin to launch their assault on this nations best fiscal preparedness for what will be uncertain global economic times ahead
7760816 let me be clear i will let no one question my love of this country
7760817 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
7760818 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama
7760819 the cautionary note of that convention to the party was to avoid at all costs the kind of open warfare on a platform issue and a large dispute that could take place in prime time
7760820 ladies and gentlemen my wife jill who youll meet soon is drop dead gorgeous
7760821 so let me introduce to you the next president the next vice president of the united states of america joe biden
7760822 i think ill have my staff get to you its condominiums where ill have them get to you
7760823 son of working class catholics biden may bolster obamas weak spots
7760824 he is a very well known quantity here in southeastern pennsylvania the mother lode of votes in the state
7760825 if he doesnt he is going to have a big problem
7760826 he has had a really difficult month in august and the republicans have done a pretty good job in framing him
7760827 i assume we are going to hear more contrast between what democrats are about and what he is about versus mccain
7760828 we are going to hear a lot of connecting between mccain and bush
7760829 there are growing numbers of voters who are scratching their heads and saying where did my party go and ive heard more republicans than democrats saying that
7760830 the republican party has a great challenge in knitting together those people who are republicans because they dont want people interfering in their private lives and the people who are republicans because they want to interfere in other peoples private lives
7760831 theres so much in our regional economy of construction development tourism hospitality agriculture in which immigration labor is vital
7760832 and a lot of people realize that closing the border is going to lead to significant changes in things like food prices and food availability
7760833 politicians ok if rich but not if seen as out of touch
7760834 like to imagine their leaders once came from log cabins
7760835 there is a sense that neither candidate is really a man of the people
7760836 they are both loaded compared to 95 or 97 percent of all americans
7760837 politicians ok if rich but not if seen as out of touch
7760838 people want politicians to be somebody who is comfortable with and understands situations that the average person faces
7760839 but the first direct election was in 1914 and every incumbent senator who was running was re elected

7761081 we are making great independent music easy for the chinese music fan to discover and buy through our partnership with r2g and the wawawa store
7761082 labels like aardvark who had interested fans in china but no real means to feed and grow that fan base made it clear that the time was right to open up distribution in china for the independent music community this is an important first step in levelling the playing field in what could one day be one of the largest digital music markets in the world
7761083 aardvark has waited four years for the opportunity to sell its music in china
7761084 it has been four years filled with frustration knowing we had artists who were popular with younger generations of chinese and not being able to provide music to them in their own currency the deal between our digital aggregator partner ioda and r2g allows us to achieve this goal

7761105 en las ligas de verano de las vegas trif n y yo tuvimos ocasi n de verle en directo en cuatro partidos y en estos d as su evoluci n en los partidos con la selecci n b lgara est siendo muy positiva

7761107 las aportaciones que desde el feminismo y la teor a de g nero se vienen haciendo
7761108 a comprender la situaci n de mujeres y hombres en nuestra provincia
7761109 lo que hace estas visitas diferentes es que abordan contenidos tur sticos pero desde una perspectiva de g nero
7761110 la huella y presencia de personajes femeninos a menudo ignorados u olvidados
7761111 estudiar y tomar conciencia del entramado social y las relaciones de poder entre mujeres y hombres sobre las que se constituyen las sucesivas sociedades
7761112 es la perspectiva de g nero la que a n no se ha incorporado al tratamiento de los temas

7761133 she talked the soccer mom talk but didnt look the soccer mom part
7761134 but do you think she looks like a soccer mom
7761135 nothing says it more than when she brought those girls out
7761136 as the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new obama biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone democrats believe a mccain romney ticket would provide a near perfect frame for their class conscious message
7761137 it will be a contest theyll say between the son of a single mother and son of a car salesman against the son of an admiral and son of a governor
7761138 and even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why obama didnt just go through the motions of vetting clinton for the vice presidency tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process it wouldnt have been true and clinton probably would have known it wasnt true but what could she have done as it turned out since obama blew her off she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this

7761156 on the 8th day of the 8th month of 2008 china made its formal statement to the world that it has arrived
7761157 i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve
7761158 china is a sleeping giant when she awakes the world will tremble
7761159 napoleon called china the sleeping giant today china has become an awakened giant
7761160 this term may be derived from the plight of the title character in jonathan swifts 1726 novel gullivers travels in which gulliver visits the land of lilliput where the tiny inhabitants tie down the giant while he is asleep
7761161 awaken the sleeping giant that is the chinese music market
7761162 it was a tough time pushing off before and just the fact that i am confident enough myself to go do that speaks volumes for the fact that i feel like im healthy
7761163 if i didnt have that strength or that push off i wouldnt be doing that
7761164 i go up there now and i feel like i have that its like that quickness that first move that first step which in stealing bases is everything
7761165 its definitely something that once you get away from it then you get back out then you kind of forget about it
7761166 im still not locked into it as much as i was a couple years ago
7761167 the other thing is i know my limitations im not fast by any means so i kind of pick and choose my spots
7761168 i think hes a good base runner anyway but if hes healthy hes shown right off the bat he knows how to run the bases
7761169 he knows when to run he knows why not to run hes been good hes been impressive its been welcome
7761170 there were a lot of mechanical things that ive been thinking about that i didnt try to think about i went back to what i did last year when i was here they seemed to work real well for me so i tried to revert back to that a little bit
7761171 when i have the confidence enough to throw it thats what ive been lacking a little bit
7761172 the third inning seems to be my nemesis this whole year
7761173 but it wasnt as bad i wasnt out there thinking oh here it goes again i left a couple balls over the middle of the plate and they hit them

7761177 hal ini disebabkan oleh kurangnya inovasi produk yang dibuat oleh bpr

7761189 ya memang saya pernah mendengar ada upaya komunikasi dari sby dan partai demokrat pada pks itu kami apresiasi tetapi presiden sby harus menunjukkan kinerja satu tahun ke depan yang lebih baik

7761201 was recording studios without any room reverb or ambience the playing room at windmill lane studios was designed to be totally dead and you can hear it on the drums it wasnt until the boy sessions that we figured out that we had to pull the drum kit into the entrance hall after the receptionist had gone home to get a decent drum sound with its three story stairwell and stone and tiled surfaces it was a great live room
7761202 it didnt sit well with us not being there but we were callow 18 year olds and steve a veteran of many great records so we let him do it his way its a great mix but it was too acoustic guitar heavy for us
7761203 it was obvious to everyone that we were driving with two wheels over the edge of the cliff and it drew from us and particularly bono a level of creativity that we had not seen before

7761211 russias historic role of the guarantor of peace in the caucasus has increased
7761212 the caucasus has always been and will remain the zone of russias strategic interests
7761213 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7761214 we are feeling very strong and we dont trust anybody especially the united states
7761215 i mean who are these nations russia is probably stronger than any country in the g 8 except for the united states and it has more credibility because it hasnt killed hundreds of thousands of people recently
7761216 it has won wars and the other countries are losing them
7761217 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7761218 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7761219 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7761220 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7761221 she had a very defined moment to her collecting from about 1948 to the time of color field painting but that never limited her interest or support she was an aesthetic polyglot with an enormously gifted eye
7761222 she knew the artists and would tell us of how one day she ran into mark rothko on the street
7761223 rothko asked her to come see a painting hed just finished and she bought it right there the way she embraced the scene was very powerful and romantic
7761224 muriel always wanted to be viscerally involved in the now in her daily life as well as in her capacity as an art collector
7761225 if she could no longer be directly engaged she would remove herself as she did in recent years as her health decreased her gut response to art and life would not allow for a mediated experience
7761226 it was equally enjoyable to visit her after the met had taken the works away
7761227 she had completely redecorated the apartment with things from many genres it really was a pleasure to see how all the pieces were combined and how she lived with them
7761228 she was very independent original and had a great eye
7761229 so all the things she was attracted to simply lived well with each other
7761230 he had an open door policy and he was available for any reason to any of his associates at the firm from the secretary to the executive vice president
7761231 how do you say something to describe his style other than wonderful he was someone of great character
7761232 his clients sensed he was always very forthright and paul was not the type of leader that said i am at the front follow me he bonded with his associates
7761233 it was the business his father was in and he grew up with it
7761234 he was very visible in chicago among the brokerage community
7761235 he was a very ethical moral type guy with this great sense of humor
7761236 this is because small scale fisheries employ more than 12 million people world wide compared to half a million in the industrial sector
7761237 and because small scale fisheries use less fuel to catch fish
7761238 small scale fisheries use fishing gear that are more selective and far less destructive to deep sea environments
7761239 as a result they discard very little unwanted fish and almost all of their catch is used for human consumption
7761240 for the amount of resources invested we havent seen significant decrease in demand for species for which the global stocks are on the edge of collapse
7761241 market based initiatives while well intentioned unduly discriminate against small scale fishers for their lack of resources to provide data for certification
7761242 its an unfair disadvantage that in any other industry would have had people up in arms
7761243 but small scale fishers are often in developing countries and have very little political influence
7761244 without subsidies most large scale fishing operations will be economically unviable
7761245 small scale fishers will have a better chance of thriving in local markets and global fish stocks will have an opportunity to rebound

7761250 when they tear down a ballpark like that obviously the history thats going on in new york you miss it
7761251 its one of the first major ballparks that i ever played in when i was coming up with the blue jays you step back you feel the history you know what has happened in yankee stadium yeah youll miss it
7761252 ive played in that stadium for the last 14 years
7761253 its a pretty special cathedral in baseball and hopefully im around next year to see the new one
7761254 i remember what i felt when i walked out on the field knowing i was walking on the same grass as a lot of historic baseball players its the honor of playing on the same dirt same grass same area that these guys have occupied
7761255 that and fenway are kind of the two meccas of baseball i guess you could say
7761256 obviously getting the chance to play at fenway every day and getting the opportunity to go to yankee stadium before they open up the new one its a pretty cool experience and something that ill be able to say the rest of my life
7761257 the first time you step in there its hard not to recognize all the history and baseball thats happened there once the game starts its back to business back to the game you just kind of block that out and go play
7761258 you ask me that about fenway and itd be different i respect what all the greats that have played there have done thats not what im saying were not a part of that we have jim rice and luis tiant to come into our locker room and talk to us were not a part of what goes on there
7761259 so you go to yankee stadium and you felt like the game was important you knew you were playing a game that people care about and thats a nice feeling
7761260 we spent a lot of years playing there where we had big brother little brother
7761261 my first two three years it was they were the big brother we were the little brother and they just pounded on us till we grew up a little bit

7761267 we shared the same hotel before the match and i remember sitting in the lobby when they arrived and thinking to myself how professional the south africans looked with their tracksuits and how organised they seemed to be with kit managers and all sorts of support staff
7761268 i thought we were going to have a really tough time
7761269 it was just a wall of noise it hit me like a punch to the body
7761270 it so was scary you could see the fear in the players eyes
7761271 they had a purple patch when they absolutely flattened us
7761272 we realized that this might be our own last chance at playing in the world cup finals so our efforts were well focused

7761847 naast de drie bestaande pijlers moet het ioc een vierde pijler toevoegen mensenrechten de kernwaarden en basisprincipes van het olympisch gedachtegoed het ioc moet zich achter de oren krabben want de schending van de mensenrechten is door de spelen in china juist alleen maar toegenomen
7761848 ik kon alles ben overal geweest en heb met iedereen vrijuit kunnen praten iedereen heeft het wel over democratie maar dat is in mijn optiek iets voor de rijken en niet voor de armen een democratie naar westers model in china invoeren is niet makkelijk en vergeet ons eigen koloniale verleden niet h als we zo doorgaan kun je alleen nog maar in san marino of liechtenstein terecht
7761849 vooraf waren we blij dat het ioc en de chinezen toezegden iets aan de mensenrechten te willen doen de realiteit was anders in de aanloop naar de spelen zijn er mensen opgepakt onder huisarrest gezet en uit de stad verwijderd de spelen zijn een grote operatie geweest om china goed neer te zetten

7761855 after the weekend i think we will be able to say that we had a productive back to school session
7761856 this year we tried to order a lot more in order to give bahamians more of a variety to chose from
7761857 we were a little worried at the beginning of the year as to how the back to school sales would go especially with oil prices fluctuating as they have been doing but things are working out for us we are actually seeing bahamians buying more this time around as compared to this same time last year
7761858 once we have the merchandise we always make the money but prices going up like for gas and food has not affected us at all the people are still shopping
7761859 we are already seeing a trend where our profits may possibly be better than last year as long as we have the white cotton shirts which are our biggest sellers we will be fine
7761860 we have been doing exceptionally well and have maintained our sales level and it is only increasing through this time
7761861 in light of the oil prices however we have tried to keep our prices as low as possible
7761862 bahamians are still shopping to my surprise though i guess nothing can keep bahamians down we will make sure our children are prepared for school in spite of what is going on with the economy still increasing
7761863 they are picking up things here and there but i think that by the end of the weekend things will get worse
7761864 i know for sure that this weekend will be busy and then once persons get booklists at school next week we will still see some persons trickling in
7761865 bahamians have to buy certain things for schools but we are seeing that they are prioritizing in terms of whats most important
7761866 but no matter what they will always make sure their children are prepared

7761919 muriel always wanted to be viscerally involved in the now in her daily life as well as in her capacity as an art collector
7761920 if she could no longer be directly engaged she would remove herself as she did in recent years as her health decreased her gut response to art and life would not allow for a mediated experience
7761921 it was equally enjoyable to visit her after the met had taken the works away

7761970 medialne szczuczki i polityczne gry polska kt a zn w uczyni a okrok
7761971 bon je vais relire la fin du chapitre pr c dent car je nen ai plus aucun souvenir
7761972 it was discovered that there were multiple null pointed function de references in the linux kernel terminal handling code
7761973 a local attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code as root or crash the system leading to a denial of service
7761974 i still have that hunger that kind of young thing inside of me that says i want to do that i still love the theater
7761975 ive been cast older than myself since i was 19
7761976 theyd laugh like hell so i knew as a kid that i had something going on that was how i got attention as the baby in the family it was like power
7761977 the best possible places i could get for the least amount of money
7761978 theyd hang out here for two years and do a show at berkeley rep or a c t a couple of shows in the little smaller theaters and theyd pick up stakes and theyd go do the 5 year 10 year plan in los angeles
7761979 i think hes comfortable here in the bay area you dont make a lot of money as an actor you do it for the love of it
7761980 a quintessential actor hes transformative so hes never boring and never the same
7761981 it freaked me out when it started to happen i was auditioning for cal shakes and people just werent biting i began to think about getting a little job someplace not in the theater just copping to that having an income
7761982 its kind of ironic that i feel like i have more to offer in some areas and yet because of my age the number of roles that im right for is narrowed
7761983 im more patient than i was as a younger guy
7761984 and being more patient allows you to make settled hopefully more informed decisions about what youre doing it allows you to be more generous with other people which in turn brings generosity back to you thats in the best of days
7761985 now i cant do physically some of the things i used to do like anybody and i get tired faster
7761986 i wasnt doing very well at auditions i was just not getting cast and i found out sort of trial and error that actors had been learning their lines for auditions so i hit auditions really hard now i work on them like theyre scenes and like theyre really important
7761987 i mean i have this extraordinary dream that ive had since i was 15 years old that paid off when i was still pretty young
7761988 i got a regular job in the theater when i was 27 i was only five years out of college
7761989 i still try to embrace every part of acting because being on that stage and having a live audience is still an electrifying thing for me because i know the possibility of swaying the audience or helping to sway the production in one way or another is infinite
7761990 i got to play a hopelessly horny romantic shamelessly outspoken and silly man that happened to be many slices of who i was and i got to let it fly
7761991 i got to play the king in the classic theater sense and carry the show after a lot of great supporting parts
7761992 its a great chance to explore the dark side of the american family and alcoholism
7761993 again dark secrets of the family a chance to explore a character with a deep reservoir of memory reopening old wounds
7761994 this is someone for whom world war ii was the central event ten years after many of his men give him a surprise party he thanks them he hasnt had a chance to open up his heart so overtly
7761995 i was at a party in palo alto on saturday night two doors down from steve jobss house and in the morning i was coming out with my bike and walked right in front of him on the sidewalk
7761996 pretty thin i thought his face looked healthy but he was very thin

7762000 eet er at digte sig selv den kristne lader sig digte
7762001 it would be good to finish the four years and get a degree at the end of it but if bigger and better things do come around ill weigh the options
7762002 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7762003 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7762004 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7762005 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7762006 the renewal of our partnership in eugene brings a lot of excitement for the future
7762007 a new stadium for 2010 along with the continued support from emeralds president bob beban and his staff make this one of the most enjoyable environments for our young players to start their careers
7762008 we consider eugene one of the great cities in the northwest league
7762009 our working relationship with the elmore ownership group and president bob beban is tremendous and we were eager for it to continue we are excited about the opportunity to open the new ballpark
7762010 i pledge to you that i will be with you in january on the floor of the senate when we begin the great battle
7762011 while i have not always agreed with his views on issues i respect his courage to speak his mind without fear or favour
7762012 simons a good player and he wanted to leave i think it was best he left
7762013 he was stale at perth glory and i dont think he was performing to his best capabilities
7762014 i think going to sydney its a fresh start for him
7762015 he wanted to play in front of the national coach so it was a win win for perth glory and simon colosimo so theres no ill feeling there at all
7762016 theres no ill feeling with simon colosimo leaving the club however you want to portray that
7762017 i am surprised that swimming queensland is talking about funding cuts because i met with the ceo of swimming queensland just a week and a half ago
7762018 i talked to him about its funding arrangements i said that i was happy to reconsider the future funding arrangements of that organisation
7762019 the funding for any sport is what we need because we need kids to be out there and doing exercise
7762020 im a pretty big believer in kids getting out there and doing stuff if the funding is not there then were not going to be able to do that which is sad news
7762021 with swimming its a pretty full time thing and you dont have time to have a job or anything like that
7762022 so the funding is really important for us and swimming doesnt really get paid that much compared to other sports
7762023 in the swim team all the people who won gold medals are from queensland
7762024 were so good but we dont really get that much compared to the ais australian institute of sport not that much funding goes into the qas
7762025 in addition to the continued price hikes for energy and fast moving consumer goods expectations of weaker economic development are depressing the consumer mood in particular
7762026 the indicator last scored a comparable low value in summer 2003
7762027 even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood
7762028 leaders of the region have arrived at the scene and they are handling the accident
7762029 any information related to the accident will be released by the guangxi government
7762030 in addition to the continued price hikes for energy and fast moving consumer goods expectations of weaker economic development are depressing the consumer mood in particular the nuremburg based gfk said
7762031 the indicator last scored a comparable low value in summer 2003 it added
7762032 even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood structures and career paths shift
7762033 given the dire situation facing local communities dependent on the lower lakes in our home state of south australia
7762034 were already doing that we have already announced that and we will work with that community
7762035 what are we doing for the lower lakes well were not simply offering 50 million
7762036 an enduring response to the long term environmental problems facing the coorong and lower lakes
7762037 to deliver water to irrigators communities and to service townships
7762038 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7762039 today is judgement day i am ready if they want to arrest me
7762040 pad have seized nbt to cut off the government communication now up to 3 000 people have occupied nbt and they plan to do their own broadcast
7762041 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7762042 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7762043 wait for the prime minister so far there is no special instruction
7762044 we had 136 individual medallists in the team of 435 incidentally great britain in order for comparison had 74 individual medallists
7762045 this i think again illustrates just what a truly amazing performance australia put in
7762046 we wish them well for the 2012 olympics and im sure theyre going to do a fantastic job in hosting those olympics
7762047 if i know anything about the australian competitive spirit and if i know anything about the australian olympic committee our lot will be there with spades on ready to take it up to the brits in the best of australian traditions come 2012
7762048 we were the sixth highest in terms of medal tally at 47 medals australia actually won 46 but we were first when it came to the inspiration of a nation
7762049 in 2004 we set up this incident management system to get staff to report adverse incidents so that quality and safety could improve in our hospitals its not working
7762050 what is working is that were getting staff to report in the past we didnt get these reports
7762051 every incident that leads to an avoidable death is a matter of great concern
7762052 having a system of reporting these incidents means that the staff have got the confidence to come forward to report them by having a permanent body that goes into the hospitals to do random audits and start improving quality and safety
7762053 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report
7762054 the clinical excellence commission is meant to be looking at this whole area and it raises real concerns about the state governments commitment to that exercise if figures like this for an area health service arent contained within the report
7762055 around 1 5 million patients are admitted to nsw public hospitals annually
7762056 the analysis of adverse incidents is intended to help hospitals improve procedures in order to reduce deaths and other incidents
7762057 however deaths due to delays in responses failures in communication or in following set procedures reflect the pressure on doctors and nurses working in hospitals
7762058 what it is is to get in there and fix these issues in the past it just hasnt happened
7762059 hes certainly playing like he wants to go away isnt he
7762060 what do you do do you make a bloke honour his contract or do you give in and say see you later
7762061 penrith are in a no win situation arent they i think the contract should be honoured
7762062 i think these days blokes get out of contracts way too easy and i think its good that they make a stand and make him earn his money
7762063 theyve basically built a team around him and he cant just say when he wants that he wants to go even if sonny bill williams did it
7762064 id make him enjoy his time and if he doesnt want to stay well theres not much he can do i suppose
7762065 obviously hes not a happy camper and we keep hearing week in and week out that hes not
7762066 so either come out and dispel the rumours or come out and say my times up im ready to go
7762067 its not fair on the club and not fair on the fans
7762068 to suggest the guy wasnt going to go back on the field because he was feigning injury is taking it just a tad too far
7762069 im not going feed it this is all driven by you guys the media so im not going to comment on it
7762070 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7762071 this presents huge socio political as well as economic risks in the next three to five years opportunities may be limited in such a scenario
7762072 we have received reports from our tactical operations group in davao that they have found debris near one village
7762073 we are praying hard they are safe alive that is our serious hope
7762074 the air force has been in the limelight because of our airstrikes of milf lawless groups
7762075 its been one hell of a fall for the aussie
7762076 investors are taking risk off the table said jonathan cavenagh currency strategist at westpac
7762077 stocks are lower and in an environment of risk aversion the aussie is likely to head lower
7762078 as soon as it hit that its spent most of the time falling mr capurso said
7762079 in terms of falling this far this quickly it would easily be in the top three fastest falls no doubt about that
7762080 its been one hell of a fall for the aussie
7762081 we think the market is going to be surprised about the resilience of the australian economy so we think that the aussie will find some support mr capurso said
7762082 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7762083 we continue to make good progress with the integration of the alcan assets that we acquired in 2007
7762084 we are on track to deliver annual synergies of us1 1 billion a1 28 billion after tax from the end of 2009 considerably higher than our initial estimate of us600 million a695 73 million
7762085 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger
7762086 when i first came and my brother dropped me off and said have a good day i was scared
7762087 its so different than elementary school but right away all these new people juniors and seniors said hi and treated me like family right away i felt like it was home
7762088 you get people with vested interests that dont have anything to do with education and in the public arena people have tenure and there are political pressures but people have to know that there are other ways of doing things that work we are constantly experimenting
7762089 if theres any crime at st genevieve i would be very surprised
7762090 what dan brought in was the idea that all of these kids are going to get a good education and go to college and that has a positive impact in this area of people respecting the school for many of the families their kids are the first ones to go to college and that gives them hope
7762091 st genevieve has a strong faculty good leadership clear vision and a success rate
7762092 location is a big part of it they provide one of the best options for parents looking for schools in that area
7762093 i was a teacher at the elementary school before the change in administration and we would encourage students to attend any other school but st genevieve high

7762100 all democrats salute hillary clinton for her excellent campaign the lady speaker of the house said one minute into her address
7762101 our party and our country has been strengthened by her candidacy
7762102 experience of being wrong on the failed bush policies that have weakened our economy and taken us from the clinton surpluses to the reckless bush deficits
7762103 as a republican i stand before you with deep respect for the history and the traditions of my political party leach said
7762104 but is clear to all americans that something is akilter in our great republic in less than a decade americas political and economic standings in the world have been diminished seldom has the case for an inspiring new political ethic been more compelling and seldom has an emerging leader matched the needs of the moment

7762108 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
7762109 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
7762110 girls and young women need to be protected from their own immaturity and sexual curiousity at that vulnerable age
7762111 prime minister kevin rudd and consumer affairs minister chris bowen must acknowledge the absurdity of grocerychoice and shut the site down immediately
7762112 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7762113 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7762114 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7762115 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores
7762116 what that tells us is that consumers believe it is of no use at all
7762117 the best thing i could do to further my candidacy is run a magnificent city

7762119 chinese refiners are unable to match gains from the high price of crude oil in international markets due to controls on retail prices

7762122 rather than it now be left to the whim or the will of the premier of the day it should be subject to the parliament of western australia
7762123 we will ban by legislation the mining of uranium in western australia and instead we will drive 100 per cent renewable energy production
7762124 uranium is in demand around the world because it offers a prospect of affordable reliable clean energy
7762125 how silly of us not to be part of that growth how silly of us or how silly of alan carpenter to deny developing countries reliable electricity for health education and potable water
7762126 our industry can take a long term view of this
7762127 if you provide the facts and information to people of goodwill eventually theyll change their mind
7762128 we would expect a water tight law that would put this beyond doubt
7762129 we can have more substantial tax cuts and we will look for that commitment from the liberal party if it is elected

7762145 jamie fisher i didnt expect to see you here i heard you were settled down out in prospect
7762146 just because im settled down doesnt mean i cant have a beer with an old friend does it
7762147 i tried jamie many times you remember out at the tucker dam spillway after the senior bonfire we were drunk on mad dog or boones farm i dont know which you let me unhook your bra but then as i worked my way around to the front you put your hands on top of mine and stopped me we were lying there face to face on a sleeping bag in the bed of shanes big red pick up and you squeezed my hands and looked me in the eyes you told me to kiss you and for a second it seemed odd to me that i had my hand in your shirt but had never kissed you your breath tasted like cigarettes
7762148 you rolled over so your back was to my chest you held on tight to my arms around you and i knew that was as far as wed ever go and then you asked me something
7762149 i told you all about the sun how hot it was how fast its light traveled to the earth everything i could think of but then you were asleep and then so was i
7762150 i knew you were more experienced than i was i was hoping you could teach me a thing or two
7762151 those other boys spreading my legs was all i had to offer them and its all they wanted but i didnt have to control you that way you didnt know it but not sleeping with you was my gift to you on your way out of town
7762152 yes you are and im married to sam and hes probably out looking for me already the bastard i should get going
7762153 i dont think so and i guess i wont be coming back to the jubil again anytime soon
7762154 just think of this as a gift but i do want you to kiss me one last time
7762155 i want you to tell me something i dont know something i can say at parties and sound smarter than i am something that i can say to piss sam off every chance i get
7762156 is immensely hot at its core it ranges around 27 000 000 degrees but gets cooler as it approaches its surface there its a mere 10 000 degrees
7762157 the weird thing about the sun is that the temperature drops as you leave the surface and into space as you might expect but then as you go even farther from the sun it starts to heat up again and gets hotter several million degrees hotter so theres this ring around the sun not of fire but of cool scientists cant fully explain it but without it the sun wouldnt work quite right and we wouldnt be here at all
7762158 since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law

7762180 das halbjahresergebnis zeigt deshalb in einer differenzierten betrachtung beides erhebliche herausforderungen einerseits und best ndige leistungen andererseits
7762181 gerade jetzt in anbetracht gegenl ufiger marktentwicklungen bew hrt sich die diversifikation von oerlikon in verschiedene bereiche der hochtechnologie und der umwelttechnologie clean tech
7762182 das management und der neu gew hlte verwaltungsrat konzentrieren sich vor allem auf zwei ziele erstens die umsetzung von sofortmassnahmen zur senkung der kosten und die durchf hrung der notwendigen umstrukturierung innerhalb des segments oerlikon textile sowie der business units oerlikon esec und oerlikon systems zweitens die fokussierung des managements sowie der kapitalressourcen auf die am schnellsten wachsenden bereiche des konzerns
7762183 das erste halbjahr 2008 hat unter beweis gestellt dass das neue solar segment seine einzigartige technologische entwicklung grossindustriell umsetzen und global vermarkten kann innerhalb von wenigen jahren hat sich oerlikon solar damit zu einem eigenst ndigen und hoch wettbewerbsf higen segment von oerlikon entwickelt
7762184 der erfolg der kerngesch ftseinheiten von oerlikon wie etwa solar coating und vacuum demonstrieren den belastbaren charakter der hochtechnologie in einem nachlassenden wirtschaftlichen umfeld ungeachtet des starken zyklischen r ckgangs des textilgesch fts und der damit verbundenen auswirkungen auf das wachstum und den ertrag des gesamten konzerns sehen wir mit optimismus in die zukunft
7762185 die durchgreifende umstrukturierung des textilsegments wird zu einer st rkung der oerlikon marktposition beitragen und das unternehmen f r den n chsten aufschwung fit machen
7762186 die unternehmensgruppe hat die st rke solche phasen zukunftsgerichtet zu nutzen ohne investitionen zum beispiel in innovative produktentwicklung oder die erschliessung neuer m rkte zur ckstellen zu m ssen
7762187 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7762188 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7762189 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7762190 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7762191 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7762192 we continue to make good progress with the integration of the alcan assets that we acquired in 2007
7762193 we are on track to deliver annual synergies of us1 1 billion a1 28 billion after tax from the end of 2009 considerably higher than our initial estimate of us600 million a695 73 million
7762194 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger
7762195 there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle
7762196 we are coordinating with pakistani authorities in investigating the incident

7762199 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
7762200 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
7762201 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviors that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses

7762203 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans
7762204 the uninsured receive a lot less care than the insured and they pay a greater percentage of it out of pocket contrary to popular myth they are not all free riders

7762227 found that the 3 warnings about serious adverse events associated with use of atypical antipsychotic agents in elderly people with dementia had a limited effect on the prescription rates of these agents we also found that the overall rates of use of these drugs actually increased between the first warning in 2002 and the end of our follow up in 2007
7762228 this finding highlights the limited impact of warnings and suggests that more effective approaches are needed to protect vulnerable populations from potentially hazardous medications

7762231 i dont have any sense that this will somehow lead to a cure for pws but it does present a new area for those interested in the disease to study and hopefully a new understanding of how the disease functions
7762232 through presenting an activity with the three components activity technology formalizing we not only give students with different learning styles different ways to see a problem we give them the extra time they may require for learning when i think in terms of varied presentations of the same problem i cant help but allot more time to the material time and experience in class enrich an activity students can learn from their experiences and connect the mathematics to those experiences such a foundation helps them to understand and appreciate mathematics
7762233 as manipulatives and cooperative groups become more widely used in mathematics classes i wanted to know whether students perceived these aids and situations as being useful learning tools three fourths of the students thought that using manipulatives when learning a new mathematical concept was helpful most of the comments indicated that using manipulatives first helped students see the origin of the numbers in the formulas fewer than one fourth of the students said that manipulatives were not helpful learning tools stating that they were confusing
7762234 williams 1988 101 paraphrased a chinese proverb tell me mathematics and i forget show me mathematics and i may remember involve me
7762235 i dont know whats going to happen i would assume that hell probably say no and if thats the case so be it ill get some practise today and tomorrow well be ok
7762236 i dont know if three or six plays although i would like to do that i dont know what you get out of that really
7762237 ive never really thought about injuries and im not saying osi did think about it but i saw the tape
7762238 that was meant to be i mean its very unfortunate for him and for the giants but it wasnt like guys rolled up on him that probably wouldve happened in practice at some point the way it occurred he just went down injuries are part of it they come in a lot of different ways
7762239 ive played so many games and not that i havent been injured but ive overcome injuries been lucky in a lot of situations
7762240 this is 18 years whatevers going to happen is going to happen i cant control that i love to play and thats really all i can think about
7762241 im going to see what it looks like over the two days and then evaluate it i cant say definitively no or definitively yes
7762242 i do understand his side of it i really do he has the whole team to think of
7762243 well i guess no more of a concern than coming in later and having a week to prepare for my first game like i did two weeks ago
7762244 to me that was a real game based on the circumstances at least in this case i will have had some practice and have worked with these guys not that that makes it any better but i feel more comfortable in that situation now than i did several weeks ago
7762245 yesterday morning i woke up and i said ok not too bad by yesterday afternoon i was like ohh usually two days after is when i feel the worst ive noticed that the last few years today will be a little tougher when you go out to practice than maybe in previous years it was good to not that i like getting hit but it was good to kind of get that over and done with
7762246 if i was a giant id do whatever i could to get him out and have him back on my team
7762247 the guy still looks great hell of a player i would have done whatever to try to get him back initially but now how could you not want him back
7762248 wouldnt that be something he comes back and we start a trend
7762249 an interactive web based visual representation of a dynamic object that presents opportunities for constructing mathematical knowledge
7762250 u ser engagement distinguishes virtual manipulative sites from those sites where the act of pointing and clicking results in the computers providing an answer in visual or symbolic form
7762251 good manipulatives are those that are meaningful to the learner provide control and flexibility to the learner have characteristics that mirror or are consistent with cognitive and mathematics structures and assist the learner in making connections between various pieces and types of knowledge in a word serving as a catalyst for the growth of integrated concrete knowledge computer manipulatives can serve that function
7762252 teachers must have an understanding of how to use representations for mathematics instruction as well as an understanding of how to structure a mathematics lesson where students use technology teachers must also be comfortable with technology and be prepared for situations where computers may not be available or internet connections are not working properly
7762253 m any state standards recommend and even require the use of a dizzying array of manipulatives in counterproductive ways
7762254 in the higher grades manipulatives can undermine important educational goals
7762255 i dont have to worry about students flicking rubber bands at each other any more
7762256 gcalc is designed to provide a basic easy to use well balanced set of graphing functionality for algebra pre calculus calculus and beyond
7762257 every button and edit area talks it is easy to use with large keys and contrasting colors it has three display areas so when the user adds a series of numbers the total is always displayed even as you are entering a new number while always displaying any numbers in memory
7762258 it displays your entries and results as you work it actually displays the equation so that you can easily see or hear your last process when students are required to show their work they can simply cut and paste the steps into a document
7762259 use it to experience geometry on your desktop or on the web
7762260 k 12 algebra applets arlen strader of the texas a amp m university has two algebra tiles applet pages to help middle and high school students explore factoring of quadratic equations by arranging given tiles into a rectangle

7762267 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7762268 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7762269 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7762270 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7762271 finally finally russia has acknowledged that we exist and that we have suffered
7762272 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will ever be one state with georgia again
7762273 the people of south ossetia and abkhazia have made their choice in life and they have made up their minds about with whom they should be and build their economic and political relations
7762274 everything saakashvili does is organized by your country and every child here knows this
7762275 freedom from georgia they humiliated us they laughed at us
7762276 whenever theres a bunch of people here at one time it gets crazy you have people bumping into you so if youre balancing stuff youre going to end up dropping something or breaking something
7762277 so if a college is looking to go green they need to start looking in the dining facility
7762278 increase our cash balance as we approach the closing of the merger
7762279 the queers to cuba tour comes at an exciting time for lgbt equality in cuba
7762280 the cubans are drafting legislation to allow same sex unions lesbian adoption and insemination and transgender reassignment surgery these changes are being broadly debated by the population yet north americans hear very little about this kind of popular democracy
7762281 the image of cuba as a gulag for lgbt people is false its a myth invented by opponents of revolutionary cuba as a gay i feel safer in cuba than in canada or the states soon island queers will enjoy greater rights and freedoms than their counterparts in the usa
7762282 we have to abolish any form of discrimination against those persons we have to redefine the concept of marriage socialism should be a society that does not exclude anybody
7762283 when i visited cuba last december with a group we met with cenesex president mariela castro espin and she told us about the concrete work being done with transgender people with lesbians and with families to encourage support of their lgbt kids several members of my group were in tears to see these efforts being carried out in a way that is so respectful and compassionate is not something most of us have experienced with institutions much less government
7762284 were probably going to lose somewhere in the neighborhood of 2 billion this year
7762285 if we dont act well lose 2 billion or more the following year
7762286 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7762287 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself were we all there shed ask softly
7762288 she was in her 75th year but i had always thought of her as ageless timeless and 100 percent cast iron damage proof
7762289 from the fateful day of our lunch telltale signs that something wasnt quite right began to emerge
7762290 a swim on part in the goldfish bowl a memoir

7762292 the one message id like to leave with the public is please do your homework before you hire somebody and please hire a licensed contractor
7762293 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7762294 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7762295 we had just let him out for the morning and he ran into the yard and started barking his head off
7762296 ldl cholesterol levels below 2 80 mmol l and levels of at least 3 90 mmol l were both associated with markedly elevated risk of cancer among patients who did not use statins
7762297 the use of these levels as risk markers may help clinicians to assess their patients more fully and thus to prevent premature deaths in patients who have high risk
7762298 low serum cholesterol is commonly observed in individuals with ill health e g cancer patients and those with unhealthy lifestyle characteristics such as smoking and heavy drinking
7762299 if there is a real commitment to protect all children then supporting families and children before they reach the point of being abused and neglected should be a priority
7762300 we already know many of the risk factors for child abuse and neglect and in many cases we could identify many children who are most vulnerable before theyre even born
7762301 the current approach does little to prevent abuse but focuses on intervening once much of the harm has already been done an approach that in my view is both unethical and inhumane
7762302 while urgent action is needed to protect children being abused and neglected we need to broaden adult focussed services such as alcohol and drug treatment mental health corrections homelessness family violence etc so that they can enhance the parenting of their clients
7762303 we also need to use health promotion campaigns with messages such as alcohol and children dont mix given that one in eight australian children now lives in a household with at least one adult who is regularly binge drinking
7762304 child abuse and neglect needs to be attacked in the same comprehensive way we have tackled other serious health issues such as smoking or coronary heart disease that is to identify the risk factors promote a range of interventions and change community attitudes
7762305 if we keep the current approach with its heavy emphasis on the crisis end of the scale then we will never see these rates reduce

7762310 it is in truth not for glory nor riches nor honours that we are fighting but for freedom for that alone which no honest man gives up but with life itself
7762311 its very difficult and heartbreaking for me and my family to go into bankruptcy but i consider it my last and final option because of the losses im facing related to winchester country club
7762312 the market conditions are the worst weve ever seen and we were unable to convince our lenders to work with us to restructure the financing so i was left with no other options im devastated that it has come to this
7762313 we just feel sorry for the people whove lost their equity the money they pumped into being a member its a mess
7762314 there has to be hospitals and things within walking distance and there just wasnt it was too far out for people to really be viable for people 55 and over and thats why it didnt work
7762315 were talking about highly wealthy people who mostly travel on private planes

7762320 i dont know if anybody outside the school knows how much we hate the cafeteria
7762321 deeply discounted distressed sales continue to drive volume in many regions of the state
7762322 its about continually looking at your work force and looking at your economic projections and trying to bring those in line
7762323 we thought that we had that two months ago but with the worsening economy we just need to do more
7762324 we know we need to reduce expenses its unclear how much
7762325 obviously you can do more if you have more people
7762326 our approach through this whole period of downsizing has been to prioritize and well continue to do that
7762327 its something thats going to have to be seriously considered
7762328 ive got to look over the plan talk with my wife
7762329 and theres a general belief that well come out of this earlier

7762339 weve got raw sewage going into our river thats not acceptable
7762340 my hope is that mayor larry obrien and the council will give some serious thought to using that to investing in water and sewage infrastructure
7762341 theres whole parts of our city that need to be reconfigured
7762342 160 000 pales when looking at the estimate to replace our plant which is some 8 4 million
7762343 i mean if this happened last night and the trans canada highway is right there weve got a pretty big country they could be just about anywhere
7762344 among other things regulatory changes in 1998 allowed for greater concentration of ownership which helped radio withstand the competition from other media
7762345 they put it down to the same things all the time when it comes to the u s markets at least in recent times and that is worries about global growth and more angst about credit worries
7762346 when you get credit worries in this environment they get manufactured to be maybe a little bit more influential perhaps than they deserve but nevertheless weve put up with it for such a long time youd think wed be used to it by now
7762347 meanwhile weve got a crime rate significantly above the national average its time they open their chequebook
7762348 when citizens are afraid to leave their houses the government has to do everything it can to alleviate that fear
7762349 i think the province has been diligent in bringing forward the police numbers and theyre bringing them up to par over the next three years
7762350 this threat ruled his behaviour through his period of captivity
7762351 so good to see you ive missed you so much so glad its over ive missed you so much came out to watch you play why are you running away came out to watch you play why are you running away
7762352 my entire basement was flooded due to a pipe bursting i had not idea how i was going to remove all that water luckily i found cleanflood com and they were able to handle the water removal and drying
7762353 all i know is that it might be a serious blast many of the fire brigades of nearby towns have been mobilized to help
7762354 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7762355 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7762356 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7762357 kinda screwed up my life back in the early 2000s
7762358 i loathe meg ryan loathe her naomi wolfs culture deserves meg ryan she is sandra dee reborn but without sandra dees talent for comedy she is so superficial she used to be on as the world turns i hated her on that and she has been doing the same goddamned act since then the woman has two facial expressions okay the fact that she is one of the great actresses of our culture right now is a testament to our poverty to our sexual poverty

7762364 when we find the bats at the turbines we find very little external injuries
7762365 it led us to think something else is at play
7762366 we were very concerned with finding an answer as to why the bats were dying
7762367 the most important thing to us over and above money is finding the problem
7762368 there have been theories they may be drawn to the turbines or insects are drawn to them and the bats are eating the insects
7762369 its really hard to say what kind of impact this is having because we dont know how many of these bats are out there
7762370 the public is always looking for some degree of assurance that these things dont happen again but nobody can provide that assurance in the meantime they have to be seen to be doing what is right and what is ethical
7762371 when they expanded the recall we acted immediately but prior to that we believe that we had taken everything off the shelf that was covered by the recall
7762372 yes we are but at this stage weve been as proactive as we possibly can
7762373 we could see the results it produced for us last year and the kind of brand awareness we got out of it we felt it was brilliant property as we saw a link between the sounds and mobile phones
7762374 it also ran over a peak sales period for us and tied in with a massive launch of the samsung soul handset
7762375 both samsung mobile and the stations brands are strongly focused on the consumer or listener and keeping them entertained we booked additional airtime for our networks to flight specific deals where consumers could get the phones that amplified the sound of joburg or the cape town sound

7762429 choosing newcomers based on knowledge of our labour market and experience within canadian society would make canada a more attractive destination for skilled individuals from around the world
7762430 international students and skilled workers would be more likely to choose canada if they knew their time in canada and contribution to canadian society would assist in their eligibility to apply to stay permanently
7762431 by restricting this benefit to only professional technical and skilled occupations the government is setting up a permanent underclass of unskilled temporary foreign workers who will be deprived of the rights to citizenship being extended only to elite workers

7762442 seo tends to be less expensive than paid search therefore even small boosts in seo spending relative to paid search can indicate larger changes in marketing effectiveness than might be indicated by dollars alone
7762443 at least one long term goal is the same for both search engines and advertisers return on the clients marketing spend
7762444 ctr is a measure of cost conversion a measure of profit but web analytics measure how you move from one to another
7762445 the first step in improving the performance of search engine advertising is to evangelize the use of web analytics
7762446 what we need are evangelists zealots missionaries people championing analytics testing and data driven decisions with religious fervor
7762447 de beperkte stijging wordt veroorzaakt doordat de winsten van de nieuwe bedrijven overgenomen met de opbrengst van de nieuw uitgegeven aandelen slechts een beperkte periode in de halfjaarresultaten zijn geconsolideerd

7762452 we have to accept more and more that platform holders themselves cannot have exclusives unless theyre given millions and millions of dollars not to develop a particular game for one particular platform
7762453 but for developers and you could take someone like quantic dream for example a great game it takes a lot of time to develop they need a little bit of funding external development in exchange its exclusive that works so exclusivity possibly with developers is more likely that exclusivity with publishers
7762454 shuhei yoshida president of sony worldwide studios can tell you what else is coming out maybe hes told you already but there are certainly from japan going to be some really really good stuff both on playstation portable and playstation 3

7762456 i think we have to accept that exclusivity is not a thing of the past but it is probably with publishers we might do a few things where we feel that we need a push here or a push there
7762457 going to shoot obama from a vantage point at 750 yards
7762458 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads

7762470 i am a female so i know how to market to a female audience
7762471 shes a woman she knows what is desirable and attractive to a female audience in a virtual boyfriend so lets have her make it
7762472 well its because youre a female youre not the target audience
7762473 this is blatantly sexist people should not be having cooking shows to win over a man
7762474 look the people who really matter are your friends and the people right before you and right in front of your face

7762482 must be based on a specific deadline for the withdrawal of foreign forces and that it should not be open
7762483 an agreement has not been signed and so from our perspective there is no agreement until theres an agreement signed
7762484 but any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position it continues to be our position
7762485 weve been opposed to arbitrary dates on the calendar especially when things were tough from a security standpoint
7762486 as conditions improve it certainly enables us to have the discussion about goals going forward and where we hope iraqi security forces will be
7762487 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7762488 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7762489 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7762490 this study shows a consistent 20 per cent increase in the risk of type 1 diabetes
7762491 the limited success of existing therapy suggested to us that factors besides erbb2 or proteins that collude with erbb2 might nullify the effects of herceptin and lapatinib
7762492 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumours and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test

7762510 after protesting the republicans for so many years the democrats have been moving steadily to the right we want to show that were not okay with that that we want to bring the party closer to the people and further from the corporate lobbyists

7762568 we felt it was a sound business decision to encourage the match as it helped us to illustrate the importance of the relationship foster an attitude of business collaboration and fortify the bond between the two cities this is crucial for our enterprise and others like us in the uk or the us it means that we can do anything together sell uk made cbrn suits throughout america or play against each other in a friendly rugby match
7762569 the inaugural mayors cup challenge match was a resounding success regardless of the final score of the match we had a fabulous experience in our sister city of dundee and a very successful trip on behalf of both alexandrias rugby team and its business community we feel that remploy frontlines support of alexandria rugby and the twinned cities programme will prove to be just as beneficial to our hometown as it is for dundee we look forward to building on what weve started over the years to come
7762570 remploy frontline is very proud to have been a part of this unique twinned city event we hope that our involvement in this programme encourages more businesses and organisations in both cities to look more closely at ways they can support the business and cultural exchanges based on remploy frontlines mission it would be great if alexandria and dundee can create more opportunities for otherwise disabled people and help further enrich their lives

7762577 two major factors were apparent to us when chris and the journeymaker 5 team approached us for support
7762578 first remploy frontline develops and manufactures world class flotation jackets ideally suited for champions like the journeymaker 5 and the waters in which they were racing second chris and his team are helping the uks many disabled children through enriching life experiences one of remploys precepts for helping disabled adults via employment opportunities

7762585 we wanted to make buddybackup completely free for everyone to use and to remove the limitations that previously were only unlocked in the paid version we didnt think it was fair to do this when so many users had already bought the software so we decided to offer a refund to everyone who has paid and upgrade all current users to the full version of the software
7762586 we are contacting all users through their registration email to let them know they are entitled to a refund any unclaimed money will be donated to a multiple sclerosis charity and save the children because buddybackup is used by people from all over the world we wanted to give to global charities as well as the united kingdom and u s a we have large user bases in china vietnam india and many other eastern and european countries so we thought it right to find charities that would be relevant to all our users
7762587 whilst the deadline has passed for miners to lodge claims there are still many claims awaiting settlement some of which may take up to two years before a successful conclusion is reached therefore the site is still critical for solicitors to continue to track the progress of any outstanding claims it is now updated by capita who administer the services for berr providing information such as requests for more health information for each miner progress on claims and the details of the claims settlements
7762588 the big challenge for the team here at wtg was that we were dealing with a service coming close to the end of its lifecycle we had to deal with end users of the site who were used to the way it works but were migrating from entering claims to their management through the process of settlement the fact that we are able to ensure that the servers and software are supported and maintained for the life of the project while ensuring that solicitors can still access the information for their clients means that we were able to deliver against objective and budget

7762595 now the books are basically sookies story sookie basically narrates everything all the other characters exist only when theyre in the same room with her i felt like that would be a production impossibility because then anna paquin would be working 12 hours a day five days a week and all the other characters were really interesting i wanted to just flesh that out a little but it is very important to me to remain true to charlaines world because i think it works
7762596 we dont really take any incidents from later books in the first season the first book really works well as a framework for a season we are however creating some events that dont really exist in the books
7762597 ive gotten to know charlaine and i sent her the first two scripts at the beginning of the process
7762598 honor your father and your mother that your days may be long upon the land which the lord g d gives you
7762599 wheres my coat i wanna see other parties ive been at this party for 7 years wheres my coat someone shit on the coats
7762600 there will be tough decisions to make because we have one game left
7762601 we have to be united at this time of the campaign most especially now that i am joining in the middle i am calling on the support of everyone
7762602 i have since watched the videos of both matches and all i can say is that it is a very strong side the defence is good and that department is the backbone of any team you must have a good defence because other things can be dealt with later
7762603 a number of people have sustained injuries and both carriageways have been closed
7762604 the motorway is not expected to be reopened until noon due to damage caused to the central reservation and the need to remove heavy vehicles from the carriageways
7762605 they are still so strong that i can see them and chelsea being the two slugging it out again for the title
7762606 they will probably meet again in a repeat of the champions league final too i shouldnt wonder
7762607 certainly i think arsenal and liverpool have it all on to finish above them
7762608 your treatment of the deceased was brutal in the extreme
7762609 you stomped on her you hit her with a hose and you took a stick or some other object and impaled her
7762610 nuclear is not green is not safe and has no role in western australias future energy mix
7762611 the question of legislation has been a difficult and complex one for western australia but i believe the time is now right to enshrine labors position in the law
7762612 how selfish of alan carpenter to deny developing countries reliable electricity
7762613 only four months ago labor opposed this very legislation introduced by the greens in state parliament
7762614 the first thoughts were i actually didnt believe that it had occurred knowing that the premier had indicated there was no need to legislate to ban uranium mining
7762615 i hate to think this was simply a move generated by politics all i could think of here is somehow the loony left has got hold of policy
7762616 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7762617 we continue to make good progress with the integration of the alcan assets that we acquired in 2007
7762618 we are on track to deliver annual synergies of us1 1 billion a1 28 billion after tax from the end of 2009 considerably higher than our initial estimate of us600 million a695 73 million
7762619 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger
7762620 susan smith and robert latimer a tale of two murders
7762621 to spare them the pain of a broken family and being separated from their dear mother
7762622 his friends and neighbors have taken up a collection to defend him for a mercy killing
7762623 anyone who believes in this charge is a torture monger
7762624 im used to seeing these great big guys so when you sign them im getting my moneys worth
7762625 the farther you go the more you become convinced youve got somebody special
7762626 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in
7762627 its been really really tough not being out there but it felt good
7762628 i had to calm down and be patient while just sitting there watching camp
7762629 there were many times i said my back was fine when it really wasnt
7762630 he is our punter and we feel good about keenyn
7762631 i think he will have a fresh leg and will punt well
7762632 the last time i was punting i was amazing myself i am at that level but i just have to be consistent
7762633 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7762634 if youre playing scared you know you have to do things right all the time
7762635 sometimes thats a lot better way to play because your adrenaline rush is 24 7 you have the mental focus to get the job done
7762636 they know they have to be 100 percent sharp or you can get embarrassed and thats a good lesson
7762637 our best defenses are always against the best teams we play perfect because we know we have to play perfect
7762638 it is like oh no we have to be good our whole defense is young we are playing as if you mess up once youre not going to be out there were playing not to mess up
7762639 a better way to describe it than being scared is you dont want a bunch of good athletes to play robotic
7762640 we want to be able to use our athleticism and to be flying around with reckless abandon you still have to understand and fit in the scheme
7762641 it is possible we may have relied too much on those guys we have to be a defense that plays a team game defensively do things right do the little things i think we have better players than people
7762642 they just need an opportunity to go out and have a chance to establish themselves
7762643 hes a very physical and powerful guard who sets up his teammates said ervin davis his coach for dallas showtyme an aau team
7762644 its point guard u theres a great history of a lot of famous guards dowell said monday
7762645 coach olson is a great coach hes made them what they are today i want to be part of that
7762646 he can hit the midrange jumper his defense like most high school kids can use some improvement but hes quick and athletic enough and can compete
7762647 even though he may not be on everyones mcdonalds list hes one of the better point guards in the country
7762648 we dont think gronkowski will be part of our game plan
7762649 its going to be a week to week deal we are pretty confident its not going to be a significant amount of time three or four weeks we are optimistic it will be sooner than that
7762650 i have to make the most of the opportunity go out there and play hard and do exactly what i have been coached to do
7762651 pilot of the airwaves since i was a kid that song was probably living in my subconscious this whole time
7762652 i think its time for someone else to have an opportunity
7762653 its time to settle down a little bit and have a life but its been great its been a true honor and a blessing and i enjoyed every moment of it i dont regret any of it
7762654 obviously im disappointed but not disappointed in the preparation or the approach that we took
7762655 if you sit around wondering what if what if what if then it kind of hurts you but i havent really got to that point i felt we did everything we could we just got beat on the wrong day
7762656 you miss being in one place for an extended time being home just three days a month thats a tough life
7762657 im looking forward to being in tucson and being home and slowing down some stuff
7762658 i will still be working with usa in some capacity
7762659 i dont have anything where i say i need to do this
7762660 i love my life and i enjoy what im doing right now
7762661 the good part is that you get to a point in your career when you dont have to do it i mean thats kind of a nice feeling on the other hand theres still a passion to help young kids and as long as i can continue to enjoy that i will keep doing it
7762662 i think some new opportunities will arrive and i will take them as they come
7762663 right now im just happy to be in the united states
7762664 debido al clima caluroso de mexicali por lo cual se decidi trasladar las oficinas de gobierno durante los meses de junio a octubre para disfrutar de un clima m s agradable y benigno esto realiz ndolo cada verano
7762665 i never felt scared not even for a moment i took just ten minutes to settle down
7762666 we have been able to establish more communication with the crew of bunga melati dua and are now able to confirm that the fatality on board involving a filipino crew member was an accident during the time of boarding of the vessel by the hijackers
7762667 all remaining crew members are safe and are taken care of negotiations are ongoing to secure the safe release of the crew members
7762668 to protect and safeguard the safety of our people on board we are not able to provide any detailed information at this point of time
7762669 the report is still unconfirmed because the ship is still with the hostage takers
7762670 it was unfortunate i suffered a number of injuries during my time here at chelsea but i always gave my all whatever the circumstances
7762671 i would like to express my gratitude to roman abramovich for all his help and encouragement
7762672 it was unfortunate i suffered a number of injuries during my time here but i always gave my all whatever the circumstances
7762673 its going to be a difficult decision but its not just about money its a feeling too
7762674 im going to go home and spends some time with my family ill sit down with them and talk about it
7762675 ill also sit down with gb coach terry edwards and see what he has to say and what offer there is on the table
7762676 to win another gold medal in my home city in 2012 would be fantastic thats what i want to do
7762677 its going to be a difficult decision but its not just about money its a feeling too
7762678 representing your country and standing on a podium with a medal is an unbelievable feeling
7762679 i say get in the gym because it gives you lots of discipline boxing has made me a better person
7762680 although the philippines remains to be a low prevalence country it should not be a reason to be complacent as statistics and trends show that the number of those infected are on the rise
7762681 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7762682 shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7762683 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads
7762684 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7762685 those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7762686 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for a world as it should be and that is the thread that connects our hearts
7762687 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbably journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7762688 and you see that is why i love this country
7762689 i can no more walk away from him than i can walk away from the black community
7762690 wuerl pointed out that the catechism of the catholic church is clear and has been clear for 2 000 years he cited catechism language that reads human life must be respected and protected absolutely from the moment of conception since the first century the church has affirmed the moral evil of every procured abortion this teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable direct abortion that is to say abortion willed either as an end or a means is gravely contrary to the moral law
7762691 life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes
7762692 we come here make a little bit of money and get some scrap
7762693 its not hard at all all the doors are open on a good day you can make 300 a day
7762694 re boarding is impossible because of the huge amount of walls that have come down
7762695 total boarding up is impossible and to spend good taxpayers dollars to try to board up or fence something that in two weeks will be subjected to demolition and remediation were throwing good money after bad
7762696 until they put up a no trespassing sign its free
7762697 they used to have doors and windows that were plywood but they cut everything down
7762698 now everything is open that place is wide open they basically did nothing

7762706 it was in closed session there was it was the borough attorney talking to the council
7762707 i decline to discuss it as it is litigation and a closed session discussion
7762708 i thought it would take some of the pressure off me
7762709 he used to bust my chops like he wanted me out of here
7762710 to the extent any illegal activity occurred one cant hide behind the attorney client privilege

7762716 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7762717 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7762718 the chips will fall where they fall with respect to whatever investigation is taking place but typically subpoenas and even the kind of action we saw yesterday doesnt necessarily determine that somebody is guilty of something
7762719 there are many precedents where people step aside while an investigation goes on
7762720 im not going to be goaded into sounding like a supercilious wrist slapping good government type this time there is just no way i got a few good editorials and a ton of grief over the bryant remark im playing it safe this time
7762721 the chips will fall where they fall with respect to whatever investigation is taking place but typically subpoenas and even the kind of action we saw yesterday doesnt necessarily determine that somebody is guilty of something
7762722 there are many precedents where people step aside while an investigation goes on

7762724 i ran for student government president against several boys and lost which did not surprise me but still hurt especially because one of my opponents told me i was really stupid if i thought a girl could be elected president as soon as the election was over the winner asked me to head the organizations committee which as far as i could tell was expected to do most of the work i agreed
7762725 probably the most seen talked about buzzed about speech of the campaign

7762727 probably the most seen talked about buzzed about speech of the campaign
7762728 lack of damage to offshore platforms during hurricanes rita and katrina
7762729 when we had katrina and rita the two worst hurricanes in at least recent memory there was not one case where we had a situation with oil or gas being spilled in the environment
7762730 lack of damage to offshore platforms during hurricanes rita and katrina
7762731 when we had katrina and rita the two worst hurricanes in at least recent memory there was not one case where we had a situation with oil or gas being spilled in the environment
7762732 we make sandwiches fresh daily and most days this corner of the store has a nice bacon odor
7762733 when we opened the first store we were just beer and wine
7762734 i felt like we needed to do something bigger and thats when we got into cheese and it just snowballed from there
7762735 we designed a wine bar and information center as the hub of the store so when you walk in thats where you go if you need help
7762736 there we taste wine seven days a week and from real glassware
7762737 we went with a wood interior wooden floor wood ceiling wood displays a bunch of barrels around
7762738 when you go to a winery there are barrels everywhere to me thats much more appealing in a wine store than wire racks and carpeting
7762739 when we were picking out wines we went out to meet with as many winemakers as possible to develop relationships
7762740 so some of the folks we buy from are so small that no ones ever heard of them but they make delicious wines too
7762741 i was just over at best cellars with founder josh wesson that guy does it different
7762742 ive been through wine stores all over the world and you wont find another store like his
7762743 everybody knows what their taste preferences are but often when it comes to wine they cant connect their palate preferences with a specific bottle or type of wine because theres a cork between them and the product
7762744 this system is just a way of looking at the world of wine how it should be by taste not label because taste is ultimately what really matters
7762745 ive been doing this in various locations for almost 30 years
7762746 so i can offer a level of intimacy that you dont get in a large store
7762747 i have an old following of customers i know their palates i know what they like
7762748 so when i go to a wine tasting i almost know when certain people are going to like a certain wine im out there buying for those people when you go into a box store they dont even know your name
7762749 i love this but i love it at this scale
7762750 business might be better in a bigger space but thats not for me that would take all the fun out of it
7762751 we make sandwiches fresh daily and most days this corner of the store has a nice bacon odor
7762752 when we opened the first store we were just beer and wine

7762768 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7762769 if i was a rank and file reactionary conservative forced to swallow political failure for more than a decade and now permitted lizard like to come out of my smelly culvert to claim a place on the sunny rock i might let the light go to my head too i might preen my scales and tell tales of the decline no the breaking of britain under labour it seems impossible to counter the triumphal gloominess of the old right with anything as feeble as unconvincing as facts the best figures available show crime has gone down but we know we know we know it has gone up the best figures available suggest improving performance at gcse and a levels but we know we know we know that this is because of a dilution in standards

7762789 this man is so full of dung it hath made his blue eyes brown
7762790 reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
7762791 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is
7762792 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7762793 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7762794 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7762795 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7762796 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7762797 inspires me the way people tell me my father inspired them
7762798 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7762799 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7762800 those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7762801 seldom has an emerging leader so matched the needs of the moment
7762802 if you care about hillary youve got to work for sen obama
7762803 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7762804 there was a real opportunity missed there to hear from somebody who really understood what it was like to fight for the powerless that was his life i want to speak to some of those same concerns he had
7762805 youve got to be economical with your words though and the longer youre in the senate the more long winded you get
7762806 people dont know his story weve got to show them his heart his story of overcoming obstacles
7762807 i think because hes so eloquent and graceful people dont know he had to struggle
7762808 senators from both parties will tell you that hes always been willing to listen to other points of view
7762809 thanks for taking my calls when you knew i was calling to ask for money
7762810 youll always be my hero because you were willing to take on santorum
7762811 im at blockbuster and i cant remember even one of the eleven movies ive been meaning to see

7762815 in addition to the continued price hikes for energy and fast moving consumer goods expectations of weaker economic development are depressing the consumer mood in particular the nuremburg based gfk said

7762817 even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood structures and career paths shift
7762818 national foods has the capability and financial strength to leverage the acquisition of acf to create new business opportunities domestically and in the vitally important asian region
7762819 while i have not always agreed with his views on issues i respect his courage to speak his mind without fear or favour
7762820 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7762821 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7762822 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7762823 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7762824 it would be good to finish the four years and get a degree at the end of it but if bigger and better things do come around ill weigh the options
7762825 i think the direction of the club is always paramount
7762826 the club is bigger than any individual but having said that it was a very tough decision for the club to move forward we needed to make that decision
7762827 if i take my playing cap off and look at it from an outside perspective we all want the club to succeed and move forward to playing finals footy and i totally understand my delisting
7762828 but from a personal point of view i still feel like ive got some time left
7762829 im not hanging my hat on getting a spot at an afl club next year but im definitely putting my hand up to say look my mind feels good my body feels good i want to continue playing

7762831 to play last week and obviously to get up this week to be a life member of the afl is something i can really be proud of
7762832 i want an early election but this must follow the necessary reform of our electoral system
7762833 i have said publicly in the past that if there is no peoples charter there would be no elections
7762834 they have climbed rooftops to tell me gratuitously that we must follow the constitution on the way forward i understand that
7762835 i believe that there is an emerging consensus for example on aspects of electoral reforms
7762836 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7762837 today is judgement day i am ready if they want to arrest me
7762838 pad have seized nbt to cut off the government communication now up to 3 000 people have occupied nbt and they plan to do their own broadcast
7762839 the easiest way to restore normalcy is for prime minister samak to quit
7762840 if we do not receive a clear and positive response we will prolong the rally to the next day and mobilise more protesters
7762841 wait for the prime minister so far there is no special instruction
7762842 we had 136 individual medallists in the team of 435 incidentally great britain in order for comparison had 74 individual medallists
7762843 this i think again illustrates just what a truly amazing performance australia put in
7762844 we wish them well for the 2012 olympics and im sure theyre going to do a fantastic job in hosting those olympics
7762845 if i know anything about the australian competitive spirit and if i know anything about the australian olympic committee our lot will be there with spades on ready to take it up to the brits in the best of australian traditions come 2012
7762846 we were the sixth highest in terms of medal tally at 47 medals australia actually won 46 but we were first when it came to the inspiration of a nation
7762847 its been one hell of a fall for the aussie
7762848 investors are taking risk off the table said jonathan cavenagh currency strategist at westpac
7762849 stocks are lower and in an environment of risk aversion the aussie is likely to head lower
7762850 as soon as it hit that its spent most of the time falling mr capurso said
7762851 in terms of falling this far this quickly it would easily be in the top three fastest falls no doubt about that
7762852 its been one hell of a fall for the aussie
7762853 we think the market is going to be surprised about the resilience of the australian economy so we think that the aussie will find some support mr capurso said
7762854 dankzij eurostar is londen nu zo dichtbij dat het net om de hoek ligt
7762855 sa nangyayaring pagbaba ng presyo ng langis wala kaming nakikitang pagtaas ng pasahe with the prices of oil going down we dont see any increase in fare
7762856 because of the recent developments we deemed to defer the hearing so we can study the movement of the oil prices
7762857 kapag bumaba ang presyo ng diesel bababa din ang pasahe if the price of diesel goes down fare will also go down
7762858 in addition to the continued price hikes for energy and fast moving consumer goods expectations of weaker economic development are depressing the consumer mood in particular
7762859 the indicator last scored a comparable low value in summer 2003
7762860 even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood
7762861 we have received reports from our tactical operations group in davao that they have found debris near one village
7762862 we are praying hard they are safe alive that is our serious hope
7762863 the air force has been in the limelight because of our airstrikes of milf lawless groups
7762864 i am surprised that swimming queensland is talking about funding cuts because i met with the ceo of swimming queensland just a week and a half ago
7762865 i talked to him about its funding arrangements i said that i was happy to reconsider the future funding arrangements of that organisation
7762866 the funding for any sport is what we need because we need kids to be out there and doing exercise
7762867 im a pretty big believer in kids getting out there and doing stuff if the funding is not there then were not going to be able to do that which is sad news
7762868 with swimming its a pretty full time thing and you dont have time to have a job or anything like that
7762869 so the funding is really important for us and swimming doesnt really get paid that much compared to other sports
7762870 in the swim team all the people who won gold medals are from queensland
7762871 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations
7762872 this presents huge socio political as well as economic risks in the next three to five years opportunities may be limited in such a scenario
7762873 given the dire situation facing local communities dependent on the lower lakes in our home state of south australia
7762874 were already doing that we have already announced that and we will work with that community
7762875 what are we doing for the lower lakes well were not simply offering 50 million
7762876 an enduring response to the long term environmental problems facing the coorong and lower lakes
7762877 to deliver water to irrigators communities and to service townships
7762878 leaders of the region have arrived at the scene and they are handling the accident
7762879 any information related to the accident will be released by the guangxi government
7762880 in 2004 we set up this incident management system to get staff to report adverse incidents so that quality and safety could improve in our hospitals its not working
7762881 what is working is that were getting staff to report in the past we didnt get these reports
7762882 every incident that leads to an avoidable death is a matter of great concern
7762883 having a system of reporting these incidents means that the staff have got the confidence to come forward to report them by having a permanent body that goes into the hospitals to do random audits and start improving quality and safety
7762884 the real concern in relation to these figures is that they werent included in the clinical excellence commissions latest report
7762885 the clinical excellence commission is meant to be looking at this whole area and it raises real concerns about the state governments commitment to that exercise if figures like this for an area health service arent contained within the report
7762886 around 1 5 million patients are admitted to nsw public hospitals annually
7762887 the analysis of adverse incidents is intended to help hospitals improve procedures in order to reduce deaths and other incidents
7762888 however deaths due to delays in responses failures in communication or in following set procedures reflect the pressure on doctors and nurses working in hospitals
7762889 in addition to the continued price hikes for energy and fast moving consumer goods expectations of weaker economic development are depressing the consumer mood in particular
7762890 the indicator last scored a comparable low value in summer 2003
7762891 even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood
7762892 rather than it now be left to the whim or the will of the premier of the day it should be subject to the parliament of western australia
7762893 we will ban by legislation the mining of uranium in western australia and instead we will drive 100 per cent renewable energy production
7762894 uranium is in demand around the world because it offers a prospect of affordable reliable clean energy
7762895 how silly of us not to be part of that growth how silly of us or how silly of alan carpenter to deny developing countries reliable electricity for health education and potable water
7762896 our industry can take a long term view of this
7762897 if you provide the facts and information to people of goodwill eventually theyll change their mind
7762898 we would expect a water tight law that would put this beyond doubt
7762899 we are trying to drive some value clothes in simple terms look good longer
7762900 we are trying to drive some value clothes in simple terms look good longer
7762901 what do we care if we were expelled from college scarlett the war is going to start any day now so wed have left college anyhow

7762903 what do we care if we were expelled from college scarlett the war is going to start any day now so wed have left college anyhow
7762904 fiddle dee dee war war war this war talks spoiling all the fun at every party this spring i get so bored i could scream
7762905 i think its extremely important just to keep making forward progress
7762906 god what gives why havent i connected with you in so long why didnt i notice
7762907 well sweet girl youve been pretty distracted before the trip you were stressed out about your job while you were gone you were focused on the task at hand and what i had to show you it was good to tell you things while you were there but you still werent chasing me then when you got back your mind was consumed by still more issues you just got distracted you realized it a little bit but there was more than you could see glad youre back i kinda missed ya
7762908 i wanted to f k around and have a good time with the gestures and voice and all that but i wanted a bush that was sustainable
7762909 to all the candidates tell me your position on gun control as myself and other americans really want to know if our babies are safe
7762910 this is my baby purchased under the 1994 gun ban
7762911 i believe we ought to move it out let the individual communities decide their gun laws and how guns ought to be treated
7762912 it has had a devastating impact on elections because the nra has targeted and spent millions of dollars distorting individual members views and al gores views
7762913 the key is going to be also attacking poverty bringing people together dealing with those kids in the ghettos that are heavy users of gun violence and they are victims of gun violence to make sure that this country attacks the core problems of poverty having child care bringing parents together
7762914 are you going to be able to keep his baby safe
7762915 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7762916 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7762917 get bitter they cling to guns or religion as a way to explain their frustrations
7762918 ill tell you what if that is his baby he needs help
7762919 i dont know that he is mentally qualified to own that gun
7762920 there used to be an organization for people who believed in a truly limited government limited taxes limited spending limited interference in individual lives and limited intervention in foreign affairs that organization was known as the republican party but the only one of those beliefs that still motivates the g o p establishment is limited taxes
7762921 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7762922 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7762923 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7762924 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7762925 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7762926 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7762927 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity

7762929 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7762930 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis

7762976 malthus was right in predicting that the population would grow geometrically but he didnt foresee our ability to make geometric improvements in agricultural technology even today with several countries in the world suffering massive famines there is little doubt that a commitment to use more land and newer agricultural methods could vastly increase the amount of food produced on earth the problem we now face is therefore more complicated than the one malthus identified in theory the food supply can keep up with the population for a long while yet but in practice we have chosen to escape the malthusian dilemma by making a set of dangerous bargains with the future worthy of the theatrical legend that haunted the birth of the scientific revolution doctor faustus
7762977 observations concerning the increase of mankind peopling of countries etc
7762978 the great increase of offspring in particular families is not always owing to greater fecundity of nature but sometimes to examples of industry in the heads and industrious education by which the children are enabled to provide better for themselves
7762979 we are the finest race in the world and that the more of the world we inhabit the better it is for the human race just fancy those parts that are at present inhabited by the most despicable specimens of human beings what an alteration there would be if they were brought under anglo saxon influence i contend that every acre added to our territory means in the future birth to some more of the english race who otherwise would not be brought into existence
7762980 are reproducing relatively too fast therefore birth control methods must be taught them they must not have too easy access to relief or hospital treatment lest the removal of the last check on natural selection should make it too easy for children to be produced or to survive lengthy unemployment should be grounds for sterilization or at least relief should be contingent upon no further children being brought into the world and so on since a high degree of intellect and imagination of scientific and artistic ability and other qualities cannot be adequately expressed or utilized in the great majority of the lower strata it is useless to plan for their genetic increase in these strata indeed it is more than useless it is dangerous for the frustration of inherent capacity leads to discontent and revolution in some men to neurosis and inefficiency in others the case is strictly analogous to that of cattle in africa in an unfavorable environment too drastic genetic improvement is worse than none
7762981 it will be necessary quite soon to face the fact that only a certain fraction of any human population is equipped by heredity to be able to take full or even reasonable advantage of a full higher or professional education
7762982 thus even though it is quite true that any radical eugenic policy will be for many years politically and psychologically impossible it will be important for unesco to see that the eugenic problem is examined with the greatest care and that the public mind is informed of the issues at stake so that much that now is unthinkable may at least become thinkable

7762995 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7762996 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7762997 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to

7763009 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7763010 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7763011 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7763012 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7763013 as you might imagine for barack running for president is nothing compared to that first game of basketball with my brother craig
7763014 i cant tell you how much it means to have craig and my mom here tonight like craig i can feel my dad looking down on us just as ive felt his presence in every grace filled moment of my life
7763015 at six foot six ive often felt like craig was looking down on me too literally but the truth is both when we were kids and today he wasnt looking down on me he was watching over me
7763016 and hes been there for me every step of the way since that clear february day 19 months ago when with little more than our faith in each other and a hunger for change we joined my husband barack obama on the improbable journey thats brought us to this moment
7763017 but each of us also comes here tonight by way of our own improbable journey i come here tonight as a sister blessed with a brother who is my mentor my protector and my lifelong friend
7763018 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7763019 i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world theyre the first thing i think about when i wake up in the morning and the last thing i think about when i go to bed at night their future and all our childrens future is my stake in this election
7763020 and i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7763021 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig
7763022 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7763023 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7763024 and as our friendship grew and i learned more about barack he introduced me to the work hed done when he first moved to chicago after college
7763025 the people gathered together that day were ordinary folks doing the best they could to build a good life
7763026 barack stood up that day and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
7763027 its the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls in town squares and high school gyms people who stood up and marched and risked everything they had refusing to settle determined to mold our future into the shape of our ideals
7763028 it is because of their will and determination that this week we celebrate two anniversaries the 88th anniversary of women winning the right to vote and the 45th anniversary of that hot summer day when dr king lifted our sights and our hearts with his dream for our nation
7763029 i stand here today at the crosscurrents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7763030 people who work the day shift kiss their kids goodnight and head out for the night shift without disappointment without regret that goodnight kiss a reminder of everything theyre working for
7763031 the military families who say grace each night with an empty seat at the table the servicemen and women who love this country so much they leave those they love most to defend it
7763032 the young people across america serving our communities teaching children cleaning up neighborhoods caring for the least among us each and every day
7763033 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7763034 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope that is why i love this country
7763035 and in my own life in my own small way ive tried to give back to this country that has given me so much
7763036 its a belief barack shares a belief at the heart of his lifes work its what he did all those years ago on the streets of chicago setting up job training to get people back to work and afterschool programs to keep kids safe working block by block to help people lift up their families
7763037 its what he did in the illinois senate moving people from welfare to jobs passing tax cuts for hard working families and making sure women get equal pay for equal work
7763038 its what hes done in the united states senate fighting to ensure the men and women who serve this country are welcomed home not just with medals and parades but with good jobs and benefits and health care including mental health care
7763039 thats why hes running to end the war in iraq responsibly to build an economy that lifts every family to make health care available for every american and to make sure every child in this nation gets a world class education all the way from preschool to college
7763040 hell achieve these goals the same way he always has by bringing us together and reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
7763041 it was strong enough to bring hope to those neighborhoods in chicago
7763042 and it was strong enough to bring hope to people who came out on a cold iowa night and became the first voices in this chorus for change thats been echoed by millions of americans from every corner of this nation
7763043 millions of americans who know that barack understands their dreams that barack will fight for people like them and that barack will finally bring the change we need
7763044 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7763045 and as i tuck that little girl and her little sister into bed at night i think about how one day theyll have families of their own
7763046 omg theyre griefing him cuz hes too good that screws the world
7763047 jerichos coach and parents say the boy is being unfairly targeted because he turned down an invitation to join the defending league champion which is sponsored by an employer of one of the leagues administrators jericho instead joined a team sponsored by will power fitness
7763048 jerichos coach and parents say the boy is being unfairly targeted because he turned down an invitation to join the defending league champion which is sponsored by an employer of one of the leagues administrators
7763049 no son try throwing it slower and maybe in the dirt every once in awhile maybe then youll make the team
7763050 when jericho took the mound anyway last week the opposing team forfeited the game packed its gear and left his coach said
7763051 it is a plea for originality passion guts and daring you cant be remarkable by following someone whos remarkable
7763052 if you dont like change youre going to like irrelevance even less
7763053 many people who have known joe for many years and have considered him a friend are disappointed
7763054 many others are actually angry he has basically turned his back on the democratic party
7763055 a vote for lamont would jeopardize our chances for getting a democrat in the white house in 2008
7763056 are a bad reflection on him as a human being
7763057 thats not the way we perceive a champion he should not make gestures like the one he made in the 100 meters he bolt might have interpreted that in another way but the way it was perceived was catch me if you can
7763058 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7763059 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7763060 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7763061 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7763062 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7763063 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7763064 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7763065 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7763066 when ted kennedy comes here to ask us all to pull together as a party not many people in this hall are not going to take that next step
7763067 it never stopped him he didnt go in a corner and weep he just started something else and now here he is tonight so tenacious
7763068 anyone whos advanced for him knows he likes a stool
7763069 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering
7763070 i have a headache from the altitude today i cant imagine what its like for someone whos got radiation chemotherapy and has to take a battery of drugs
7763071 their stories are very different but they share a commitment to the timeless american ideals of justice and fairness service and sacrifice faith and family
7763072 leaders like them come along rarely but once or twice in a lifetime they come along just when we need them the most
7763073 id heard it from a pretty good source last night but everyone was thrilled to hear about it at our breakfast this is the kind of moment that sen kennedy lives for
7763074 id heard something over the weekend but his health is such an issue it wasnt clear if hed be able to come
7763075 im a cancer survivor and i know how draining this kind of thing can be
7763076 it pushes the focus back on the challenge ahead and on obama and the race it gives people something positive to talk about
7763077 this may be ted kennedys final gift to the party
7763078 this says that he feels this is the democrats year and the party is not as unified as hed like it to be his appearance takes the headlines away from the clinton faction
7763079 happens to be somebody who i love to death hes just a good man and obviously hes going through a difficult time but im glad that we can use this convention to remind people of the contributions hes made to this country
7763080 just charges the atmosphere here the emotion is enormous its just what you want to start off the convention
7763081 in 1984 i was very unpopular with the democratic party
7763082 i had committed the unforgivable sin of losing in 1988 there was a little more warmth and this year ive been more or less reconstituted as a positive figure
7763083 i have participated in the last three conventions when we did not have an incumbent president to re elect
7763084 but will now follow the custom established during the past 40 years by other democratic presidents including harry truman who only attended the first convention after he left office
7763085 anyone who believes he is responsible for what bill clinton did in secret at night with a young intern is absolutely stupid and ridiculous carter told georgias delegates
7763086 he cant stand up as frankly as i did and explain it to you but somehow in the american peoples minds he has to convince them of that absolute truth
7763087 sasha obama is cuter than hello kitty having a tea party with stephanie from lazy town with two kitty cats on unicorn day
7763088 it was a great time and i highly recommend political vindication radio for anyone interested in some solid political talk radio
7763089 i enjoyed the show thoroughly frank and shane are solid hosts and asked some questions that i really enjoyed answering
7763090 that was so much fun and i have to say you guys are real pros almost intimidating youre so good at it
7763091 let me say it was a pleasure to talk to you guys and be asked such important and intelligent questions
7763092 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7763093 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7763094 were not a public utility were a newspaper and we cover things based on what is newsworthy people who have half a percent or less following among the public are much less newsworthy than people with 40 and 50 percent
7763095 the nader campaign is based on a simple premise there is no difference between the two major parties
7763096 this is true if you stand far enough away from the two parties in the same way new york and tokyo would look similar if you were standing on the moon
7763097 a self indulgent exercise that that will distract voters from the clear cut choice represented by the major party candidates
7763098 the public deserves to see the major party candidates compete on an uncluttered playing field
7763099 protectionism would destroy our prosperity and make the worlds poor even more miserable it is a strange platform for the ralph nader who says he speaks for the weak and the neglected
7763100 many of those who are thinking about voting for mr nader probably imagine that he is still the moderate humane activist of the 1960s
7763101 any presidential candidate whose running mate is winona laduke an ojibway indian activist from a minnesota reservation must be considered both marginal and self indulgent
7763102 like an enormous zit on prom night when least expected or desired nader and his green party followers have reappeared on the political scene
7763103 one of the saddest sights in politics is a fading public figure who refuses to concede that his or her time has passed
7763104 the latest egotist to ignore reality is ralph nader the aging consumer advocate whose crusades stalled and popularity sagged long ago nader is in the great tradition of political diehards who stubbornly hope against hope that they can keep the reporters and speaking fees coming despite all the derisive laughter
7763105 the two party system works fine if not perfectly why cant we leave it at that
7763106 in the process of expanding in europe germany is one of several possible future markets
7763107 we receive inquiries from all over the world there is enormous interest in current
7763108 according to our observations germany is a market that could soon be ripe for current
7763109 tv and the web amount to the same thing to us
7763110 unlike most broadcasters we do not only use television to attract people to the internet on the contrary people go to current com swap thoughts concerns and videos and then we bring the best of it to the tv screen
7763111 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7763112 he does not feel that obama has given him the respect due to him as a former president
7763113 he should have called clinton and asked him for advice about foreign policy or suggested a joint appearance
7763114 los 59 pasajeros a bordo y los cuatro tripulantes debieron descender del aparato debido a un alerta por humo

7763144 petitioner cannot file a petition for review with the cta en banc to appeal the resolution of the cta first division
7763145 in sum the cta en banc did not err in denying petitioners motion for reconsideration
7763146 equally settled is the rule that an order denying a motion to quash being interlocutory is not immediately appealable nor can it be the subject of a petition for certiorari such order may only be reviewed in the ordinary course of law by an appeal from the judgment after trial

7763152 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7763153 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7763154 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7763155 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads
7763156 a brief but historic choice between a black man and white woman
7763157 yes i favor the execution of bravo and those who attacked lanao del norte
7763158 unfortunately they milf have no power and no strength to execute bravo and his cohorts of terrorists and criminals
7763159 those among his men who killed the innocents and robbed the poor of their cash and property
7763160 their use of criminals and terrorists in the battlefields weakens their cause and erode their strength in their negotiation with the filipino nation
7763161 we dont really think about when and how we use water but it is a valuable resource and as it becomes more expensive we need to act

7763190 investors on the lookout for stock market bargains should be very cautious of energy stock tips that usually come pouring in on faxes emails or phone calls
7763191 global warming scenarios rising gasoline and fuel oil prices and instability in the middle east have sparked investor interest in energy and alternative energy stocks but these same factors have fueled a rash of energy related stock scams
7763192 those that claim to provide high returns for little risk are usually hyperbole and misrepresentations their goal is to pump the stock price up not to make the consumer money the con men then dump their shares leaving the certificate holder with a worthless piece of paper

7763206 i am also aware how difficult it is to find accurate and unbiased information targeted to the average motorist on the internet the articles written by jason lancaster from accurate auto advice are providing our readers with an education so that they can become better informed consumers and approach the experience of buying a car with more confidence

7763251 the big difference then was that things actually happened at conventions
7763252 i was the go for for walter cronkite at the republican convention in san francisco
7763253 even for the broadcast networks the convention beats doing a summer game show rerun
7763254 its four nights every four years covering how a party wants to present itself and how a candidate wants to present himself as the possible president is worth doing

7763268 because im wearing a pink shirt and black stretch pants
7763269 i was excited because it was my first time going to school
7763270 as soon as the suspect passed the victim he felt himself being stabbed in the back
7763271 the victim next heard the suspect yell out a gang name
7763272 the investigation is continuing and it is considered gang related
7763273 the indian software employment figure probably crossed the 400 000 mark in 2004 and is now closer to 900 000
7763274 nonetheless the two are still comparable in employment size yet not at all in terms of profile
7763275 an important thing is to consider the basic desires of people even if all youre thinking about is a simple game
7763276 its the same thing even in business its nicer when you have a well organized excel spreadsheet then a cluttered one
7763277 but then again if you try sometimes you know what you might find right
7763278 my current life blows maybe if i could get into a delorean with a flux capacitor everything would be ok
7763279 maybe but not for a long time its going to take a while to forgive
7763280 yeah yeah yeah we fought we were mean we didnt treat each other with respect we were not good together yeah yeah yeah sure whatever but sigh what if were the one for each other
7763281 holy cow only love on earth ahhh all 2b soblessed

7763286 as in we dont match up in my life as i see it we dont quite fit
7763287 i learned this shes stronger and tougher that he bill clinton is when she takes a point youre gonna have to be sure youre well informed because she will not compromise shes very bright shes strong and when she gets her dander up she aint going to roll over
7763288 im convinced he has a sexual addiction he needs to get help for his sake he has already damaged his presidency beyond repair
7763289 when truman boarded a train january 1953 at union station without a penny in federal largesse except a microscopic army pension the president knew he would have to sell some property and would even have to dip into his own pocket to buy stamps to answer the 72 000 pieces of mail he received in just the first two weeks after he left the white house
7763290 he assured me the press stories concerning the kickbacks he got in exchange for state contracts were not true he lied to me
7763291 boy is she bitter about the press if george w loses shes gonna pop off the bush press bashing didnt abate even after their boy became president
7763292 i dont know what powell is going to do but if he were to jump into the political arena as a republican he could get the nomination as vice president if not the presidential nomination and he could beat clinton easily
7763293 john mccain would be stronger against gore gore will be a dull unspiring loser candidate for the democrats mccain looks stronger he is stronger mccain because of his military service and vietnam prisoner of war hero status you know he had a hehluva military record
7763294 bush has that air reserve texas national guard record of course gores war record in vietnam aint much either
7763295 this crazy bitch needs to take her ass to bed
7763296 she made the request on her private computer with a private logo and not as part of her job responsibilities as a county commissioner
7763297 if shes doing things in her private capacity then shes entitled to privacy rights as a private citizen

7763301 i wasnt sure if i could feel my baby moving so a friend suggested i lie down for a while after a few minutes i started feeling a butterfly sensation in my lower abdomen it was amazing
7763302 given the current budget constraints of the county it is only prudent to support the exploration and extraction of oil and natural gas both on and off shore with an enhancement of revenues to local governments
7763303 county would have less authority in environmental safeguards oversight and economic benefits a better policy would be to allow a gradual and intelligent expansion of oil exploration and extraction rather than to accomplish the same under emergency conditions
7763304 im going to hang around and walk through the convention hall and shake as many hands as seem to be friendly
7763305 they say i got them into politics not the young ones of course

7763312 i really just cant say enough about how pleased i am that pathpoint was awarded this contract
7763313 well certainly have very few people at most who will lose their housing
7763314 i probably hate to say 100 percent no one will thats unrealistic in the best of times were just going to minimize to the best extent possible people losing their housing
7763315 to sum it up there still will be losses of services but we are doing our best to make lemonade out of lemons
7763316 i honestly look forward to going forward because there is no going back
7763317 i believe that they are taking the changes to clients seriously
7763318 they are looking at each person and assessing what they can do to minimize their impacts
7763319 the lack of accurate fair and consistent credit standards in the industry poses a serious problem for every game developer
7763320 by refusing to acknowledge their contributions studio management limits the professional recognition and opportunity for development that every contributor deserves
7763321 arbitrary unfair and in some cases even vindictive they simply dont hold up
7763322 your department has too many people in it and we dont want to change the credits anymore
7763323 7 critical facts everyone should know before buying a hybrid car
7763324 weve looked at several ways to play anticipated growth in wind energy weve also considered titanium makers for that industrys ties to the production of lightweight modern aircraft
7763325 while the two trends might not appear to have much in common at first glance hxl offers a way to play both the aircraft and wind markets
7763326 the connection is the lightweight composite materials hexcel makes that are used by producers in both sectors hexcel develops and manufactures advanced structural materials
7763327 it is the largest u s producer of carbon fiber the worlds largest weaver of reinforcement fabrics and the number one producer of composite materials
7763328 its product was initially developed for the aerospace industry but is now used in a wide range of applications from golf clubs to satellite arrays and from the rotor blades of wind turbines to life saving monocoques for formula 1 race cars
7763329 its been a rollercoaster ride for hexcels stock in the past 12 months the shares hit their one year peak of 27 19 in december 2007 by january 22nd they had plummeted to 17 the shares rebounded through may only to fade again year to date hxl is off about 15
7763330 second quarter profits came in shy of wall streets expectations as a result of costs associated with the start up of four overseas manufacturing plants and a weak u s dollar the reason hexcel has been investing in plants in europe is to be closer to customers such as airbus
7763331 hexcel just won a big order from airbus that was the biggest in the companys history
7763332 hexcel is in a great position to profit from the growing investment in wind energy platforms and the demand for lighter weight more fuel efficient airplanes the skyrocketing price of crude during q2 did much to disrupt the plans of cash strapped airlines to acquire the new planes
7763333 boeings delays getting the dreamliner in the air have also been well documented those are short term problems however long term it is inevitable that air carriers will want these newer planes in their fleets
7763334 wind energy is obviously a hot topic too oilman boone pickens is pushing wind farms as an alternative to oil fired power plants al gores alliance for climate protection meanwhile has promoted them as an anecdote to greenhouse gas emissions
7763335 when two guys like gore and pickens coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum can come to the same view theres some karma happening
7763336 a strong dollar should help hexcels cost structure in its overseas plants and could well lead to an earnings surprise in the second half of the year if the trend continues this is a stock to keep on our radar
7763337 the ipcc is a scientific intergovernmental body set up by the world meteorological organization and by the united nations environment programme
7763338 the governments the ipcc is open to all member countries of wmo and unep governments of participate in plenary sessions of the ipcc where main decisions about the ipcc workprogramme are taken and reports are accepted adopted and approved they also participate the review of ipcc reports
7763339 leaving my television on all day and night so i can increase my global footprint
7763340 i have to put everything on the table i dont think its a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer let us use those royalties to invest in renewable energy resources then we have something to talk about
7763341 oh were going to have elections were going to have them by october theyre going to be inclusive theyre going to be transparent theyre going to be fair and this or that

7763347 deserves open and honest debate featuring the true facts from all sides and not just the propaganda from one
7763348 capitalism is the greatest system ever created for alleviating general human misery and yet it breeds ingratitude because we constantly hear how cruel capitalism is while this collectivism or that is more loving because unlike capitalism collectivism is about the group not the individual

7763379 im sad and im worried i think the way they have treated hillary is terrible ive never felt this insulted and humiliated
7763380 all we have are hard choices and not many options
7763381 theres going to be loud conversation this fall and real screaming in 2009 unless there is real relief
7763382 or one by one were going to be toppling over the edge of the cliff
7763383 weve gone all around the state listening and weve heard a lot about rising costs
7763384 my sense is that my committee gets it and well be looking at ways to provide funds
7763385 basically the same money we all had two years ago is the same money well have next year only things dont cost the same
7763386 the goal of this change was to cut taxes so its frustrating that the legislature is pushing us to raise taxes
7763387 when the majority gets back to 1 17 were right back where we started
7763388 i know theyre hurting just like the private sector is hurting
7763389 right now we have it a lot better than other states things could be worse we could have decreasing property values like california
7763390 its not like school districts expect there to be a santa claus but i think there might be more optimism that is warranted
7763391 in the back of your mind youve got to think what if they dont fix school finance what if this continues
7763392 while this measure may be appropriate for other protected uses it is not appropriate for schools because it does not take into consideration that the area between the school building and the boundary line of the school is utilized for school activities such as student recreation
7763393 public safety can only be maintained if the setback is measured from any area which could be occupied by students
7763394 i think there are situations where youve got very large school grounds that are unused

7763427 they have no respect for democracy the clear cut majority does not want to sell water to texas or anyone outside this state

7763430 its just like having a gun at home except there are more children if a child gets ahold of a gun there will be accidents
7763431 we knew about this hamas attempt to create a pr event at sea for weeks
7763432 we knew whos on these boats and what they contain and therefore we decided weeks ago to allow them to come into gaza they were not carrying weapons and had only a handful of equipment for the hearing impaired
7763433 many people thought these boats would make a significant contribution to break the siege not only politically but also in terms of bringing in goods equipment food and medicine
7763434 however once it turned out these boats contained no food and only activists most people left the beach disappointed
7763435 one cannot place any responsibility on the palestinian authority for these theatrics as the pa has no control of gaza
7763436 handful of provocateurs seeking a public relations stunt who initiated a political protest aimed at boosting hamas regime of horrors in gaza
7763437 what kind of contribution does this journey make to the promotion of ideas of reconciliation and compromise none
7763438 attests to the israeli distress caused by this international peace initiative
7763439 they were looking for anything they could find to make a news story out of thin air not one idf ship was ever seen by these protesters
7763440 at the end of the day we do need to lie
7763441 if we make a mistake we will be the first to admit it while the international media sees day after day pure propaganda coming from gaza the international media has come to learn the difference between democracy and free speech at work in israel and hamas terrorism in gaza journalists have long memories and many remember wall street journal reporter daniel pearl and the recent kidnappings of journalists in gaza by hamas
7763442 they are very brave they are very strong i am proud of them
7763443 nobodys come up with a way to prevent this from happening even here in the u s
7763444 the u s is probably more internet dependent than any place in the world so to that extent were more vulnerable than any place in the world to this kind of attack
7763445 so much of what were doing in the united states is out there on the internet and all of that can be taken down at once
7763446 this is such a crucial issue at every level our security now is dependent on computers
7763447 its a whole new era political and military conflicts now will almost always have a cyber component the chief targets will be critical infrastructure and the attacks will emerge from within our own computer systems
7763448 it only takes a couple of experts it doesnt take a whole cyber infantry division to pull something like this off
7763449 for a very small investment in resources you can have a huge impact
7763450 when it comes to our government it security were pretty strong in protecting against attacks
7763451 we can command so much bandwidth that its hard to overwhelm our servers
7763452 we are vulnerable to more sophisticated attacks but right now most of the people who want to do us harm dont have those capabilities
7763453 youd see some disruption of essential services like electricity youd definitely see espionage
7763454 would it be decisive no nobodys going to win a conflict with the united states in cyberspace but would it be disruptive and irritating yes
7763455 we dont know quite what the rules are for this kind of conflict if its spying its illegal but is it an act of war and who do you arrest
7763456 were much safer in the u s than we were a year ago but we still have a long way to go
7763457 you kill palestine children in gaza we will hack into your websites
7763458 its jews who believe that christ is the risen savior
7763459 two years ago it was kabbalah last year it was alcoholics anonymous she was into peace for a while whatever is of the moment thats lindsay but the one thing it does show is her commitment to sam she could be any religion and lindsay would be open to it
7763460 ifcj affirms the right and responsibility of evangelicals to share the gospel the organization neither endorses nor discourages such efforts
7763461 no rabbi eckstein and his ifcj are no longer partners with the jerusalem post in the production of the christian edition though the publication remains a natural friend and ally of his organization
7763462 the construction work going on at the site raises the suspicion that someone is trying to judaize a catholic site and prevent freedom of religious expression
7763463 where gentile and jewish believers came together to pray for the spiritual eyes of israel to be opened to their messiah jesus
7763464 my job as president would be to try to make sure that we are tightening the screws diplomatically on iran that weve mobilized the world community to go after irans program in a serious way and to get sanctions in place so that iran starts making a difficult calculation
7763465 weve got to do that before israel feels like its back is to the wall
7763466 i dont want to speculate on whether or not israel feels like it has a green light or not
7763467 what is not speculation is that we have to act much more forcefully and effectively on the world stage to contain irans nuclear capabilities
7763468 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
7763469 general attitude is we will not allow iran to get a nuclear weapon
7763470 personal hygiene is very important because no one likes to be close to a person who stinks and is dirty so whoever you are and wherever you go remember wash your hands before you eat and your feet before you sleep
7763471 the nsg exemption should be clean and there should be no additional condition
7763472 they may want to push but india cant be pushed civil nuclear cooperation is important but that doesnt mean at any cost
7763473 should we allow ourselves to be pushed are we not indians are you not proud of yourself and what you are doing
7763474 nothing which impinges or seem to impinge on indias national interest will be acceptable
7763475 do you think there should be a gc in leipzig in 2009
7763476 the industry and visitors are giving us their clear support to continue with the fair in leipzig
7763477 anyone who has experienced the enthusiastic mood in the exhibition halls over the last seven years knows this fair belongs in leipzig
7763478 the fairs and conferences in leipzig are becoming increasingly international and attract more and more visitors we will do everything to help this new cultural sector and the gc games convention to achieve further success

7763484 te lo pido simplemente por precauci n no tengo miedo que el grupo chi hizbul me secuestre o torture como represalia pero
7763485 por esta incre ble vivencia no me creo a n que est en israel me he dado cuenta de que los israel es son muy parecidos a nosotros el l bano es el m s progresista del mundo rabe y en beirut la vida es parecida a la de cualquier capital europea adem s las chicas libanesas son muy guapas como las israel es aun no s qu ciudad es m s vitalista si tel aviv o beirut
7763486 no es algo normal para mi ver ondear banderas israel es que representan mucho dolor para mi pa s y mi familia que durante la guerra del 2006 sufri mucho en beirut
7763487 no hemos firmado ning n acuerdo de paz pero quer amos ense ar que ambos pueblos sufren y que los j venes escucharan a la otra parte era muy interesante ver a una palestina representando a israel y explicando porque no hay que entregar el gol n a siria o a un israel representando a la delegaci n siria o un estadounidense exigiendo en nombre de los palestinos el fin de la ocupaci n
7763488 claro que hemos debatido mucho y varias veces me enfadaba escuchando la otra parte pero es muy importante hablar
7763489 tengo 19 a os y no creo que vea la paz alg n d a el problema no somos nosotros sino los l deres que prefieren tierras o la econom a
7763490 por primera vez he conocido de cerca a israel es
7763491 ha sido muy interesante ya que hemos conocido a muchos extranjeros que no eran conscientes de la complejidad del conflicto y ahora lo entienden mejor hemos tenido varios talleres de trabajo donde nos han ense ado en profundidad los diferentes temas en discordia
7763492 fue un placer para todos que viniera aqu es muy importante hablar no es la primera vez para m ya que cuando estudiaba en suiza y luego trabajando en australia tuve muy buenos amigos libaneses

7763512 det er paradoksalt at man omhyggeligt giver en skattelettelse til danskerne i form af et h jere besk ftigelsesfradrag et h jere personfradrag og en h jere gr nse for betaling af mellemskat for blot at opkr ve en god del af skattelettelsen i form af tvangsopsparing som bestemt ikke rammer de som f r gavn af skattelettelserne ikke at det er meningen

7763531 leadoff double but we missed the ground ball to short and it ends up costing you a ballgame
7763532 the move they made today makes us a lot deeper gives us confidence any time you can get a guy to help you out especially in close ballgames and in the late innings its nice to have
7763533 we feel like we have some arms now that especially from the seventh inning on we can finish out some games unfortunately tonight wasnt one of those cases weve got a long stretch to go and its nice to have eddie on board

7763540 we know how hard it is out there we also have families what im trying to tell you is that its a difficult decision as elected officials we have a responsibility to our taxpayers

7763545 the kiddos are really the first ones to hear about this type of stuff
7763546 i think the best thing we can do is be alert and aware of whos on our campuses
7763547 everybody in todays world has to be on top of anything that looks unusual
7763548 one of the things we tell parents and students is its their responsibility to help keep their schools safe
7763549 one of the ways they can do that is share information with us about things that are not right things that are suspicious
7763550 thats something were very excited about to get going this year

7763559 our palace on wheels is a great success story and we expect the royal rajasthan on wheels will also be the same as we have added more onboard facilities in the latter
7763560 the itinerary of the train will be same as palace on wheels except that it will go to bikaner instead of sawai madhopur
7763561 though it has not been finalised yet it is expected to be rs 25 lakh per trip
7763562 palace on wheels is being run on revenue sharing basis with railways
7763563 i think we have another nuclear agreement in the queue ahead of that russian deal that were really focused on right now and thats the india civil nuclear agreement and thats generating a lot of work and time and energy on our part to get that done

7763565 not only are individual economies better prepared to weather a sudden stop of capital flows but the risk of financial contagion in the region may have decreased as a result of the reserve accumulation
7763566 the average optimal level of reserves for asia is estimated at around six months of imports twice as large as the traditional benchmark three months estimated optimal ratios for indonesia india china and taiwan province of china are above six months
7763567 for instance chinas reserves before 2004 had not reached the optimal level predicted by the model and india breached the threshold in 2003

7763573 the attackers were armed with automatic weapons they were wearing black robes and speaking to each other in oriya they sprayed bullets at the swami and killed four others
7763574 we killed the swami as he was mixing religion with politics
7763575 this attack is the handiwork of the christians there were four home guards at the ashram had the attackers been maoists they would have first attacked these cops swamiji was fighting the missionaries for four decades we see a clear christian conspiracy behind this attack
7763576 prescription sleeping pills can be important in certain situations but they can cause a lot of adverse effects and are not a long term solution for older people sleep medication can increase the risk of falling as well as interfering with other medicines
7763577 sleeping pills are not the best way to solve underlying problems like depression or painful conditions that are interfering with a good nights sleep
7763578 most people know that coffee cola or black tea can interfere with their sleep
7763579 but many do not realise that alcohol is one of the major causes of a bad nights sleep
7763580 refuse a patient because of his or her sexual orientation
7763581 uncomfortable situation one they can best manage by helping individual patients find the best practitioners for their specific medical needs

7763583 physicians can refuse to perform any procedure such as abortion or in vitro fertilization that they find morally objectionable but if they do perform such procedures they cannot provide them to some groups of patients and not to others
7763584 the court is simply noting with clarity and consistency that as a protected class gays and lesbians are entitled to equal treatment
7763585 young women who have been exposed to a number of negative life events should be considered an at risk group for breast cancer and should be treated accordingly
7763586 we can carefully say that experiencing more than one severe and or mild to moderate life event is a risk factor for breast cancer among young women on the other hand a general feeling of happiness and optimism can play a protective role
7763587 the mechanism in which the central nervous hormonal and immune systems interact and how behaviour and external events modulate these three systems is not fully understood
7763588 the relationship between happiness and health should be examined in future studies and relevant preventative initiatives should be developed
7763589 because time consumption is associated with emotional experiences thinking about donating time reminds people of the happiness achieved through helping others
7763590 we argue that thinking about time activates goals of well being and beliefs involving personal happiness in contrast thinking about money suppresses such emotional goals and instead activates goals of economic utility and beliefs about attainment of such goals

7763607 this case has been a rollercoaster ride since the beginning the california pharmacists association applauds judge snyder for recognizing the damage that the cuts were having on pharmacy and the patients they serve
7763608 we are grateful for this much needed and timely victory the judge has saved the day for patients and for the pharmacy network in california
7763609 our findings suggest that among children from less acculturated families participation in this oral health program leads to not only more favorable beliefs about the health related preventing cavities and gum diseases and psychosocial beautiful smile and self confidence benefits of oral care behavior but also an increase in oral care behavior such as brushing flossing and dental checkups

7763612 this study provides some interesting clues into why some children are more likely to develop into adult snorers and adds to the body of evidence that respiratory problems in early life can lead to the development of respiratory conditions in later life
7763613 snoring is more than just a nuisance and can be a sign of a respiratory condition called sleep apnoea which affects more than 110 000 people in the uk and is caused by the narrowing of the throat during sleep we would welcome further research in this area to establish why exposure to these risk factors causes some children to become snorers in later life

7763630 por mi experiencia y bas ndome en los estudios realizados los videojuegos violentos tienen un efecto negativo en ni os y adolescentes
7763631 hablo de estudios que han demostrado incluso que su reacci n f sica cuando est n jugando con las consolas es la misma que cuando se ponen agresivos en la vida real se les acelera el coraz n se les sube la presi n arterial y realmente se comportan m s violentos
7763632 hay otros problemas relacionados con el sexismo racismo y valores que no son apropiados para un menor y que ciertos videojuegos inculcan de manera sutil haciendo que el joven vaya formando su personalidad bas ndose en dichos valores
7763633 no se puede afirmar que alguien que juegue a un videojuego en el que mata a alguien lo vaya a hacer en la vida real pero si se sabe que quien juega muchas horas todos los d as adquiere una conducta agresiva y responde con violencia a situaciones de la vida real
7763634 un adolescente no deber a jugar m s de una hora al d a
7763635 los padres adem s deben explicarle que lo que ven en esos juegos no es la realidad si un joven juega a matar en un videojuego por diversi n no va a saber que en la vida real eso ni es divertido ni un juego
7763636 cuando el videojuego tiene una clasificaci n m para mayores de 17 a os pedimos identificaci n a los j venes que quieren comprarlo de forma que ning n menor puede tener acceso a ellos
7763637 los videojuegos m s populares del momento incluso pueden probarse antes de comprarlos para que los padres sepan exactamente lo que sus hijos est n viendo

7763644 stand up and commit acts of violence in the cause of justice
7763645 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7763646 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7763647 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7763648 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7763649 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7763650 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7763651 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7763652 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7763653 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7763654 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7763655 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7763656 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7763657 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7763658 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7763659 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7763660 every day in the gulf coast league youre liable to see something youve never seen before
7763661 we have information about death of three persons in raikia area the details are being collected
7763662 the situation in kandhamal district is very tense but under control

7763666 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7763667 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7763668 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7763669 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7763670 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7763671 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7763672 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7763673 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment

7763679 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7763680 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7763681 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum
7763682 scotland should always be a stand alone advertisement nation at whatever i believe
7763683 but i had no idea what local repercussions would be
7763684 my first response was i couldnt see anything but benefits for that part of scotland because its pretty neglected apart from the oil fields
7763685 then i changed my allegiance later with rangers owner david murray
7763686 i met him when i got the freedom of the city here and immediately we had chemistry
7763687 we enjoyed each others company hes an amazing chap and weve stayed very very good friends since
7763688 and i get spat on if i go to parkhead
7763689 i think thats partly to do with living here all the time when you really get outside i think you get a more objective look
7763690 weve come to renew our daughters rail ticket today tuesday 26 august and ended up on the phone for about five hours after discovering the huge increase in price between this year and last year
7763691 last year we paid 212 and she could use any service she liked but this year we have come to renew it and without any warning found the price is now 573
7763692 she has seven or eight friends who also use the train everyday and they are all finding the same thing its very frustrating and is making me furious
7763693 we already have the various bills in the household going up and now the cost of this has added even more to that which will worry people i havent been made aware of the change and then i suddenly have to find a huge amount of money
7763694 they had ad hoc arrangements with schools in the area some of which received a 75 per cent discount which was clearly unprecedented
7763695 now we have a fairer student connect card which offers a third across all lines
7763696 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7763697 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7763698 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7763699 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7763700 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7763701 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7763702 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7763703 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7763704 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7763705 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7763706 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7763707 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7763708 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7763709 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7763710 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7763711 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7763712 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7763713 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7763714 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7763715 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7763716 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7763717 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7763718 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be
7763719 start of a new day in america under obama start to loose freedom start to loose liberty keep growing government bigger and bigger start of socialism in the american government
7763720 as a lifelong democrat who will be voting for mccain this fall
7763721 es zeigt sich dass es in den vergangenen jahren keine dramatischen ver nderungen gegeben hat
7763722 es ist noch nicht dramatisch aber hier m ssen wir sicherlich aufpassen
7763723 if you have a fabric that can get as close to fur as that its an amazing thing
7763724 i try to use what were strong in and in peru what were strong in is alpaca cotton and silver
7763725 treat all as your own self do not have a double standard
7763726 curiosity killed the cat but for a while i was a suspect
7763727 there really is so much history with the success of walt disney world that stems back to fort wilderness and because of the nature of this property and the theming we really havent done a lot of changes
7763728 it is such a kind thing to do i am really very grateful bless the man that has done this if i had won a million pounds on the lottery it would not mean as much as this one act of true kindness
7763729 i am in turmoil without my injections i wont even be able to see cars when im crossing the road what is going to happen to me
7763730 because of my treatment i am able to do many things i can sit and read i am a member of the university of the third age in cambridge where i do needlework and other crafts
7763731 without the treatment i wont be able to do any of these things
7763732 what do you know and when did you know it
7763733 we have been open for business all this time but people did not want to travel the extra mile or so to get here
7763734 it made a big difference to us so much so that we werent even opening on a monday and tuesday for lunch as it wasnt worth the cost of having the lights on and paying the staff
7763735 we dont know whether this will have a long term effect but were hoping people will start to come back
7763736 the job of highways is not just to look after the roads but where and whenever we can our wildlife too
7763737 the badgers had extensively undermined the road and made it unsafe for traffic but as a protected species we could not move them until the right time
7763738 we had been working closely with wildlife experts to make sure the badgers were moved properly and monitored
7763739 unable to license the work to be done until we can confirm either ownership or occupation of the land
7763740 these steps have been a right of way for many many years and there is a view that says there should have been a consultation period on this decision
7763741 it was made out of cycle by the council leader as it was deemed an emergency situation however some of us felt it could have waited until the next scrutiny meeting
7763742 it would mean we would have to leave quayside altogether
7763743 they know if they move us we will simply move further down it isnt getting rid of the problems just moving them to another part of the river
7763744 we make it as safe as we can with two people helping at all times to get people on and off
7763745 if they shut down the middle stairs i would be going to the council to ask for them to make sure that the scudamores steps are similarly restricted on health and safety grounds
7763746 the results of our survey showed that many young people in royston felt there was very little going on for them and also that many would enjoy a music event of this type
7763747 hopefully event horizon provided this opportunity as well as a chance for local bands to perform to a large crowd
7763748 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7763749 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7763750 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7763751 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7763752 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7763753 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7763754 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7763755 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7763756 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7763757 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7763758 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7763759 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7763760 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7763761 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7763762 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7763763 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7763764 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7763765 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7763766 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7763767 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7763768 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7763769 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7763770 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7763771 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7763772 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7763773 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7763774 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7763775 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen
7763776 i am not going to comment on the politics of it
7763777 behavior like this can be characterized as highly suspicious i mean we considered that the vehicle he was driving was not listed or registered to him it was a rental car it was not rented in his name he has no known address where he can be contacted here the ammunition the weapons clearly that would give one great concern
7763778 janie norman may have lived a lifestyle very different to yours you may not approve of her lifestyle but she is entitled to the same protection of the law as any other person alice springs town camp surrounded by alcohol abuse and lived a chaotic lifestyle does not mean that her violent death is just another statistic
7763779 your treatment of the deceased was brutal in the extreme
7763780 you stomped on her you hit her with a hose and you took a stick or some other object and impaled her
7763781 in the past juries have been somewhat indifferent to violence by aboriginal men against aboriginal women
7763782 that did not seem to be the case here i had the sense that overall some kind of value was placed on her life
7763783 it is often the case that aboriginal witnesses can be reluctant to be involved
7763784 but its a credit when they do and its a credit to the prosecutors that they were able to get them to come forward
7763785 we are delighted to partner with whitegold so all australian businesses can benefit from the same advanced digipass strong authentication technology as used by the vast majority of australian banks and financial institutions to secure their online banking applications
7763786 with such a security savvy partner as whitegold we are confident digipass and enterprise authentication will soon become synonymous
7763787 we are extremely happy to represent vasco and partner with the world leader in strong user authentication
7763788 vascos vision and commitment to authentication and internet security is impressive the same vasco business model flexibility and capability to deliver that has made it number one globally combined with our local enterprise knowledge makes for a very strong partnership its good to see a company that still listens to its customers particularly when we have exactly the same mantra ourselves here at whitegold
7763789 the vts tm platform is a potent and flexible technology permitting the limitation of gene expression to endothelial cells undergoing angiogenesis
7763790 the uniqueness of the vts tm platform can be utilised for the technological advancement and commercialisation of novel treatments targeting life threatening diseases where angiogenesis occurs
7763791 both products are ideally designed for effectively stimulating the growth and maturity of new blood vessels thus aiding in enhancing the vts tm platforms efficacy in thwarting areas that suffer from lack of blood flow due to the obstruction of the existing blood vessel
7763792 the other clinical stage products being designed by the company include a broad array of small molecule drugs targeting anti inflammatory disorders as well as diseases of the arteries
7763793 we use a team of trained removal experts from a specialist external company to move furniture and medical equipment during a removal process the team is supervised by one of our managers to ensure our hospital policies and procedures are followed
7763794 in this instance four removal men were being supervised and none of them moved or touched patients however our in house team of porters were working alongside the furniture removers to move the patients which is something they are trained to do
7763795 these patients were moved to another ward to allow their ward to be thoroughly cleaned and at no time was patient care or safety compromised
7763796 ive never seen anything like it most of the old people were too ill to speak out against it
7763797 it is correct to say at this stage that 0 per cent of practices in cambridgeshire have introduced extended hours however given successful discussions with local practices we have every expectation of hitting the target of 50 per cent of practices offering extended hours by october 2008
7763798 gps have mixed views about extended hours in theory it is fantastic offering access to patients at a time convenient to them in practice it means you have to have a doctor plus receptionists and security running the surgery for extra hours i get a sense it is costing gps to do it
7763799 the situation deteriorated when shane davis and the youth decided to take matters into their own hands
7763800 by exiting the house and approaching the group they were both armed with a weapon and they were verbally aggressive
7763801 he was not the trigger for this incident but he was party to it
7763802 it was a shock to see this group outside he was fearful but also foolish he should not have picked up this loose stump of picket fence
7763803 it started as a dispute between two teenage girls one was at the party and one was part of this group but this dispute became rather heightened and it escalated
7763804 you went to a party drank yourself into oblivion and got yourself involved in a fracas we will not accept this sort of behaviour
7763805 unveil the first technical details of the new operating system at two conferences in october
7763806 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7763807 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7763808 however the bluetooth signal at 1 milliwatt is extremely low compared to some cell phones which may emit up to 3 watts the signal is also transmitted throughout a space and not in a single powerful beam bluetooth radiation is considered far less bothersome than cell phone radiation
7763809 people tend to view rhonda tavey as either a saint or a fool

7763814 really an offence against the species as such and in the abstract not against human individuals
7763815 plus i immediately shut off when anyone takes schopenhauer seriously this is the philosopher who decided women are ugly stupid and evil because he got rejected by one theres a strong example of rationality for you
7763816 humans and animals are in the relevant sense the same and their interests should therefore be given equal consideration is undermined
7763817 it does seem to make intuitive sense that animals are metaphysically distinct from humans
7763818 although the interests of an individual animal might not be harmed the interests of each species can be

7763830 if theres any comparison between the compassion and decency of the american people and the terrorist tactics of extremists its flawed logic

7763845 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her

7763872 we were excited to lend an element of interactivity and engagement to what can otherwise be a fairly sleepy part of ones daily routine
7763873 learning from the great success weve seen with the interactive touchscreens at our koodo shops we jumped at the opportunity to bring elements of this experience and more to consumers through a mass advertising channel

7763910 2008 is the first year when production has reached the level prior to that of saddam husseins fall
7763911 the increase in the generation of electricity has been achieved by repairing some old plants and installing some new ones
7763912 distribution is now much improved as sabotage has been eliminated to a very high extent because the security sitation is much better this has affected our network now most of the network is in operation
7763913 there are still some lines which were sabotaged two or three years ago and now we are trying to rebuild them
7763914 the capacity of iraqi power stations is actually far higher but plants are so outdated and in bad shape that they frequently shut slashing generation to less than half of the 13 000 mw of nominal capacity
7763915 we may face a very serious problem if we do not put in place new power generation
7763916 the need for energy will be much more we have millions of iraqis out if these people return to iraq this means that new projects would be needed this is a pressing need

7763919 we want to send the message that article 140 is not dead
7763920 article 140 is very important for us and our people in that area we are impatiently waiting for the article to be implemented
7763921 will resort to mass civil disobedience if we find out there is a conspiracy against the implementation of article 140
7763922 the political reality indicates that a political agreement is necessary
7763923 the best approach is to figure out what works for all parts and reach a consensus that will work and satisfy all parts

7763925 god protects fools drunks and the united states of america
7763926 if the democrats think were going to be able to nominate someone who can win without that person being able to table unimpeachable credentials on national security and foreign policy i think were making a tragic mistake

7763931 this is a guy whos used weapons of mass destructions this is a guy who has destabilized the whole neighborhood this is a guy who in a war with iranians over 800 000 people on both sides were killed this is a guy who is an extreme danger to the world and this is a guy who is in every way possible seeking weapons of mass destruction that case in and of itself ought to be sufficient
7763932 discontent over the failure of our political system is rampant throughout our citizenry

7763966 they are besides themselves and feeling helpless but they are trying to stay positive
7763967 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
7763968 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
7763969 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
7763970 i um had a little run in with larxene sir

7763976 hey sorry i couldnt show you to yor room axel and demyx tried to get me to steal some of saixs underwear but it rather sounds like theyve done it themselves

7764007 this is what happened on august 23 2008 when california congressman brad sherman well known for his pro ltte stance held a public meeting at reseda high school for constituents of his 27th district
7764008 a large crowd of concerned sri lankan expatriates including the buddhist clergy were gathered at the location from 1 pm onwards carrying placards
7764009 the congressman had of course stealthily moved to the hall avoiding confrontation with the protestors assembled at the main gate
7764010 the vociferous commotion led to continuous police attention there was however no police action as the protest was conducted lawfully and peacefully
7764011 some protesters noting the congressmans presence at the auditorium began moving in there
7764012 the sri lankan group that moved into the auditorium without carrying placards were occupying front seats and looking for an opportunity to voice their case the initial opportunity dawned when a written question on the sri lankan terrorist issue was taken up for discussion by the congressman
7764013 bypassing the issue of receiving ltte funds he went on saying
7764014 a petition signed by protesters demanding the congressmans resignation from the u
7764015 we sri lankan americans love our motherland congressman please help our motherland to move on devoid of terrorism
7764016 reading the placard implicating the congressman having accepted campaign funds from a terrorist group sherman stated
7764017 an exchange ensued when the congressman was disputing the issue
7764018 yes there is proof that you have accepted donations from the ltte
7764019 do you accept that the ltte is a terrorist organization
7764020 we cannot keep these people if we dont pay them

7764022 haha i know you were in the states and i was dying to tell you thats why he was with us in india
7764023 p cant be mean he is a hit now with his track lol
7764024 yes but im coming back tomorrow multiple entry visa hai i have work here
7764025 im so psyched about it we are shooting monday tuesday and thursday this week and its really cool
7764026 they liked it so much they are bringing us back for some encore time to beef it up
7764027 we actually just had a rehearsal at director catherine hardwickes house the other day for a new scene
7764028 i know theyve been showing it to some people and some people go i want to see a little more of this or i dont quite understand this
7764029 i wouldnt be walking tomorrow if i spilled those beans but im psyched especially about the wardrobe
7764030 it gives us a little bit of history of the cullen family they are just shooting a couple of different added scenes and the scene im in i can tell you its me and robert pattinson rosalie and emmett are in that scene
7764031 well i am going to be in the prom scene now at the very end of the film
7764032 at first we didnt film that and now some people are saying they want to see a bit more of jacob and they want him in the prom scene at the end
7764033 we have been finding quite large shards of roman pottery and some iron age pottery which is very soft and crumbly and therefore tends to be found in smaller fragments
7764034 burnt mounds dont usually consist of very much more than a hearth and a tank and a heap of burnt stones but in shetland we seem to have much more complex structures with little rooms or cells leading off from a main passageway which connects the hearth and tank we have approximately 300 burnt mounds on shetland but only four or five have been excavated and of those the cruester mound is the most fascinating and complex it looks as if it has been in use for anything between 500 to 1 000 years
7764035 one theory is that these structures may have been used for cooking meat or tanning hides but it is possible they could have raised steam by heating the water and that these little cells could have been used as saunas
7764036 we probably moved about 60 tonnes of stone altogether so it has had the nice attraction of being a bit of a daft project but it worked and i think it has turned out to be a really good community project
7764037 the local group here came up with a novel idea for dealing with the problem
7764038 it is great to have had the chance to give new life to this particular site and make it accessible to future generations while also learning something new not just about cruester but about burnt mounds in general
7764039 we feel it has addressed our initial concerns with regard to the preservation of archaeological deposits of national importance by omitting the southwest corner of the previous application site
7764040 we now have the complete bow equipment quiver and arrows
7764041 and we have surprisingly a lot of organic material like leather parts of shoes and a trouser leg that we wouldnt normally find
7764042 if we get more carbon datings from this site we can get the most precise picture of short term glacier fluctuations for the past six or 7 000 years
7764043 the fact that we still find these 5 000 year old pieces of leather tells us they were protected by the ice all this time and that the glaciers have never been smaller than in the year 2003 and the years following
7764044 the sheer number of new finds exposed by the fire is the most exciting development in archaeology in my experience
7764045 one of the very rare features exposed by the removal of the entire plant and soil covering is a set of defined borders to the areas cultivated in the bronze age
7764046 but it gave us access to a landscape which we could never have reached otherwise on such a scale no archaeologist has the means to dig out an area like this what we have found as a result has altered perceptions of the period it also raises questions about the scale of what else lies hidden over the rest of the north york moors
7764047 this was the first statuette from this period that had such detailed features and it was also the first statuette to be discovered at the time on an archeological site
7764048 resulted from perfect observation of the human body but she was also arranged to make her curves more harmonious
7764049 shes a rather older woman one who has certainly already had children
7764050 moreover we cant prove that women played a predominant role during this period and that these female statuettes honoured them there are many other statuettes from that period representing animals part humans and part animals or asexual human beings
7764051 its the idea of going out of the world the way that you came into it
7764052 we found that the hairs came from sheep and cattle just the types of animals that herdsmen care for during their seasonal migrations
7764053 this method could for example be used in checking the purity of products made from animal hair such as pullovers and jackets made of cashmere wool
7764054 wait paris hiltons solution to the energy crisis actually makes sense
7764055 it was the kind of game where you could not afford to make a mistake and a massive one
7764056 you had to get into half time at 0 0 and then win it thats the biggest regret i have if you are focused you should stop them scoring at that level knee high in the middle of the goal
7764057 it was the worst performance ive seen from an arsenal team in a long time
7764058 tony adams was sitting just behind me and i said to him wheres the leadership
7764059 one team is offering what we want and another one isnt
7764060 but the player is interested in the one that is offering the least
7764061 se trata de una persona delgada medio an mica con anteojos de marco plateado que el pelo le cae por encima de la frente es como un cerdito blanco con el pelo cortado como con molde si es una mujer de piernas gruesas y medias blancas se sienta al fondo del aula y pasa inadvertida de apariencia triste y con pocos amigos si es un hombre le gusta ciencias pasa horas viendo computadoras en las tiendas antejos gruesos y es el primero en hacer fila para pedir aut grafos de sus artistas preferidos de apariencia fr gil estudia en un lugar reconocido
7764062 this man is a cleareyed pragmatist who will get the job done
7764063 has stared down dictators and spoken out for americas cops and firefighters
7764064 acknowledges responsibility for most of the mistakes and misjudgments that led to his early departure from the race saying he was cocky immature and naive about the demands of a presidential campaign
7764065 to demonstrate the staying power and the seriousness a lot of you reporters doubted that i have
7764066 there has been a return to the fashions of antiquity the new styles in jewelry design actually date back thousands of years i always take older jewelry as examples for my new designs
7764067 we now think these circular structures are bronze age homes it certainly seems possible that some of these buildings have in some way been burnt down the site stretches from a south west to a north east direction and it does seem likely that if fire took hold in the south west then given the direction of the prevailing wind the possibilities of disaster are obvious its an interesting speculation the cairns appear to have been built slightly later potentially after the conflagration perhaps in what psychologists would now describe as a process of closure the settlements use was changed from a living community to a place of the dead
7764068 thats probably the richest resource you have for finding a doctor who will communicate well with people
7764069 the bottom line issue is the level of rapport or the level of confidence that i have with my doctor
7764070 thats a great starting point for any doctor patient relationship
7764071 there would be no chance for mr heim to take control of his fathers money as long as there is no hint or proof for mr heims demise there is no legal basis for german authorities to declare him dead
7764072 i do not see any way the kids can inherit the bank account of their father
7764073 as long as we dont know he is dead we have to assume hes still alive
7764074 we are staying tuned to his case as we are talking about very cruel crimes
7764075 we are still verifying really as to what transpired because this is something very unusual the aircraft and the pilots were all okay before take off and everything was normal until that time
7764076 we still do not what really happened really but the last contact we had on the c130 was at the butuan air base
7764077 common experience to illuminate the experience of the nazi universe of death and vice versa
7764078 the moment the crime is committed there is an eclipse of humanity the moment is transient but paradoxically those framing the unspeakable become eternal there is nothing you can do it is done the day after i did not want to wake up and if i had the strength to put an end to my life i would have done it the shame of living after that day was very strong one does not believe in life anymore
7764079 our way to remedy the irremediable evil consists in the eclipse of humanity but at omid we acknowledge each victims humanity and create a space for empathy
7764080 at a starting point it means that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him i know i dont walk alone i know if i can get myself out of the way i can carry out in some small way what he intends
7764081 for a minute there there were just two christians worshipping together
7764082 john mccain is going to be a tougher opponent for obama than anyone could have guessed a few weeks ago
7764083 he is able to tell a very powerful story that is really emotionally connected to his audience
7764084 america saw this as a debate without squabbling they talked about religion and values without bitterness and accusations
7764085 these are the kinds of forums we need i want people to know me well im sure john mccain feels the same way if we are known i trust in the american people to make a good decision
7764086 it really shook him up he and i both essentially went through high school and college fantasizing about christina applegate so at first he was really excited like dude i totally get to see christina applegate nude but i guess the trauma of realizing that he drove a dagger into the collective heart of men everywhere by cutting off the very things that helped him through the rough spots of puberty was just too much for him
7764087 it started out kind of funny actually she was lying there on the table unconscious he was joking around check it out im finally getting to touch kelly bundys boobs but then you could almost see a kind of black cloud of realization drift over him as i handed him the scalpel and he remembered the task at hand when it was all said and done he just stood there for awhile then screamed what have i done and ran out of the room crying
7764088 as the church we urge the political parties to take national issues seriously and avoid advancing selfish partisan interests
7764089 we are losing time we need to move forward and break the impasse
7764090 we urge negotiators to recognise the urgency of economic priorities
7764091 they will need to create an environment in which production can begin to take place and economic stability established we will continue to pray for gods grace and to encourage all citizens to pray for the process that has begun so that all people are reconciled and become one
7764092 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show
7764093 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7764094 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the screen would be amazing
7764095 it would take dr who to the next level so should be very successful
7764096 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too
7764097 following my suspension by the general medical council i have been informed that the greater glasgow and clyde health board has taken legal advice and may cancel my contract to provide medical services this means i will no longer be able to work as a general practitioner at all in future my staff will also lose their jobs
7764098 necessary to send a message to the medical profession that this behaviour is unacceptable
7764099 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a you made a serious misjudgment and embarked upon a potentially criminal act
7764100 they indicated that they were considering terminating my contract and since then ive been told that they are looking at it quite seriously
7764101 obviously i dont want that to happen im 62 now and dont think i could cope with starting up a new practice i understand there will be another meeting next week but have been told not to expect good news
7764102 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a
7764103 that the panel allowed their personal views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence their treatment of dr kerr they made a serious misjudgement and embarked upon a potentially immoral act
7764104 the panel is of the opinion that you allowed your views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence your treatment of patient a you made a serious misjudgment and embarked upon a potentially criminal act
7764105 that the panel allowed their personal views in respect of physician assisted suicide to influence their treatment of dr kerr they made a serious misjudgement and embarked upon a potentially immoral act
7764106 one way of finding out what the true value of an item is is by searching through some of the closed auctions and look at what other people have already paid for the same cartridge that you are considering bidding on in the past
7764107 it is important that you learn as much as you can about the seller before you put in your first bid
7764108 did i ever tell you about the man who taught his asshole to talk
7764109 nous avons d cid de suspendre imm diatement le d mant lement de nos installations nucl aires

7764112 my job is so boring bla bla bla i have to work at a desk bla bla bla
7764113 refrain from arresting or citing pot smokers during the convention
7764114 we have an opportunity to struggle again to save the south central farm and restore it to its original function in the community
7764115 for a project of this magnitude i think its a good process to go through
7764116 objects of historic and scientific interest that may be appropriate for recognition protection or improved conservation and management
7764117 when evaluating the information to be included please remember we are looking to identify significant historic or scientific qualities that make these areas special unique and worthy of additional protection or recognition
7764118 to put it in more simplistic terms we are looking to identify the wow factor for each of these sites
7764119 we rely on fishing as a source of food and jobs
7764120 those who live in the cnmi have no interest in ceding their cultural heritage to the federal government under the auspices of environmental protectionism
7764121 this is an opportunity for president bush to do something really good that will be looked at as a high point of his administration if he does it right
7764122 by right i mean he gives big broad protections and full protections around these islands and atolls not postage stamp protections
7764123 i will share the gospel with words but also in power
7764124 who do you think among your contacts and friends are close to the kingdom
7764125 who do you think are open positive and maybe ready to lead into the kingdom
7764126 if you believe that these people are positive and open ready to receive christ what are you going to do with that the next three days it is up to you know
7764127 who do you think among your contacts and friends are close to the kingdom
7764128 going down into the sea with flames on one of the wings
7764129 so if you read from that you will know that if there is one force that the enemy would want to strike it would be the air force

7764135 io ti ho amato andr e non saprei neanche immaginare come si possa amare di pi
7764136 it was a reiteration of the governments policy to continue its brutal war on muslims
7764137 the indian state too has targeted muslims branding them terrorist after 9 11 and the indian parliament attack muslims were targeted once again our party is willing to unite in a broad front with all the genuine democratic forces which would be willing to fight back the hindu fascist offensive
7764138 one of the principles of homeschooling is that when you dont know much about something you can be sure someone else out there does there will always be a web user another parent from the cooperative or a text book author
7764139 but he explained that with the help of text books and manuals and family cooperatives it was quite possible to take over childrens schooling
7764140 when you think that mao and the nazis used state schools to spread their propaganda i think homeschooling is a good alternative
7764141 we dont want the state to influence our childrens ideology
7764142 the environment of other schools such as safety drugs or negative peer pressure
7764143 schools are cruel to force children to remain seated six hours a day i want my daughters to live in an environment that leaves them free to learn what they want at the age they want
7764144 at home there are always books on the table and we try to do either maths or writing plus reading music and artistic education every day we also learn how to make bread and build miniature houses and have lessons in critical thinking
7764145 i like being educated at home because i can learn what i want when i want if i were at school i would have to stick to the curriculum and couldnt learn what i wanted to if it was scheduled two or three years later and anyway ive got lots of friends who get taught at home like me so im happy
7764146 age is not a determining factor in social relations throughout life we learn as much from the young as from the old in our group the pupils are rather free and lack discipline that recently led to one of the families withdrawing from the group because they found it too loose for their children that is one of the problems we need to address there is certainly a middle way between sitting and being silent all day and doing what you want when you want but questioning authority is a good thing
7764147 in theory people could keep their children away from school quite legally pretend to teach them at home and do nothing all year
7764148 in the 49 other us states parents may function as private schools the obligation to be trained teachers is not laid down in the constitution
7764149 because children educated by their parents often get better results in admission exams to american universities
7764150 the influences to which these future citizens are subjected by remaining solely in their family environment do not open them up to thought and the diversity of opinions implied in a democratic society if childrens interaction with people of different races different economic situations or different intellectual levels are restricted by their parents when their time comes to take part in the democratic process they will tend to reject any opinions that differ from their own
7764151 whatever their faults state schools play a vital training role in culture and knowledge of society
7764152 the children learn about life there they encounter different opinions and just because parents fear bad influences does not mean they have a right to keep their children away
7764153 teaching your children requires too much energy on the part of parents and notably the mother
7764154 homeschooling has grown but it remains marginal traditional schooling still has a good future ahead of it since the majority of parents continue to send their children there without worrying too much about what they will learn after all the public school is the principal babysitter for american children
7764155 scholastic achievement and demographic characteristics of home school students in 1998
7764156 many children left behind how the no child left behind act is damaging our children and our schools
7764157 thats a question you have to ask the legislature thats the last thing we want to do is make any kind of cuts to the classroom and dismantle everything weve put into place to decrease teacher to student ratios
7764158 there was some type of disturbance and the fire resulted related to the disturbance
7764159 thats my boy ill take care of him no matter what
7764160 labsence de certification common criteria est une barri re majeure pour les projets gouvernementaux ou pour les clients de march s tels que ceux de la finance

7764164 from a security standpoint anonymity has to give way to the right of others on the plane to feel safe
7764165 i would challenge the private sector to come up with methods and forms and systems of identification that would meet these performance metrics that would accurately identify a person whos been validated working from a respected breeder document or some kind of database that truly verifies and validates identity and that satisfies the security measures because i believe that we should then be in a position in the government to say well accept that identification

7764228 lee child you write a series about an ex military cop named jack reacher whos got terrific investigative skills he uses those skills to solve problems which sounds like a formula for mystery and yet your books read more like thrillers how do you see your books are they mysteries thrillers or both

7764230 behavior like this can be characterized as highly suspicious i mean we considered that the vehicle he was driving was not listed or registered to him it was a rental car it was not rented in his name he has no known address where he can be contacted here the ammunition the weapons clearly that would give one great concern

7764235 we went to the fourth floor to check and the entire hallway is gone
7764236 you could see the wires hanging and when you go up to the fourth floor you can see the sky
7764237 what were thinking is that the weight of the water coupled with the shingles caused the entire upper level in the center hallways to just cave in
7764238 mother nature certainly had a hand in creating this scenario
7764239 water just kept coming up and by friday evening we had evacuated to some friends house over off jonas friends from church
7764240 this is even worse then the 2004 hurricanes that just kept rolling through a lot of debris came down during those storms and went right in the creek a lot of trees came down and just clogged it like a beaver dam back there
7764241 ive been here for about 17 years we had it water close to coming in but it never did come in the building
7764242 water was rising up toward the bottom of their house it doesnt look like it was close to entering the house but they didnt have a way to get out their cars had been moved to higher ground we sent one of our rescue boats in to remove the children
7764243 the walls have to be replaced and all the carpet and the wood floors and maybe some of the doors
7764244 we have street closures of lazy acre and main street scenic drive and forest those are middleburg streets that run alongside black creek the waters are receding and were moving the barricades back as the water recedes but we anticipate theyll probably be closed for at least another day or two

7764288 its fantastic having won this race especially after the disappointment of budapest the team did an amazing job in preparing for this grand prix and the benefits of that could be seen right from the very first day yesterday i got pole and today the win with the race fastest lap as the icing on the cake you cannot ask for more especially at my one hundredth grand prix with every single one of them powered by a ferrari engine i got a good start and i pushed to the maximum right from the early laps in the second part of the race the car was exceptional but also in the final stint when i had the softer tyres i could do the lap times easily this is an important moment in my career and i must continue to work in this way i am sorry for what happened to kimi we have to look very carefully at our reliability i am confident the team knows which countermeasures to take to react to this issue as it has always done in the past
7764289 i cant complain with second place today this was a strong weekend for us despite my having a few problems health wise but we pulled through the track was pretty difficult to overtake on but i maintained the gap our lap times showed that our overall pace was good which was encouraging heikki kovalainen and i scored 13 points today which is very positive for the team so id describe it as a satisfactory weekend for us
7764290 i started pretty well but in corner one i went over the kerb and lewis was closing in the second corner i was going to overtake lewis but i saw felipe braking quite early it would have been too much of a risk as i could end up overshooting the braking point and crashing into him over the next few laps i was consistently a bit slower than lewis suddenly i saw a white plastic bag flying across the track but could not avoid it and it went under the car i couldnt steer for two corners which was extremely dangerous fortunately most of the bag soon flew away but my confidence was very low over the next sector and i lost around three seconds in the end i finished third eventually i think my good qualifying result yesterday was crucial for todays result
7764291 my start was good and i was consequently able to overtake kimi raikkonen before the first corner however im not really happy with how the race went for me after that because i had grip problems with the prime tyres in the first and second stints whereas with the option tyres in the last stint i had much better grip and traction as a result i could close the gap to robert kubica a little at least i scored five points but a podium would have been much nicer having said that its good that the team scored a lot of points with lewiss second place and my fourth place
7764292 that was a good result and a great performance by the team the weekend started badly for me but it has finished really well today so im happy i could drive a strong race without attacking much i pushed very hard when i needed to while paying attention to taking care of my tyres and my brakes throughout this shows how good we are getting and how nice it is to race with a competitive car every weekend toyota is doing a very good job this year and looking strong and more competitive at every circuit the team is still pushing with the development work so im confident that we can maintain the form in the coming races and keep the points coming
7764293 incredible a perfect day it was fun but tough and hot out there its a nice race track my start was not so good on the dirty side and going into turn one i was right on the limit and very close to kimi raikkonen and could defend my position against jarno for the first stint but he had a bit more fuel on board and stayed out an extra lap and he overtook me in the pits but we can be very very happy with this result we made no mistakes no mistakes all weekend and maximised our performance the whole team can be very proud of what it has achieved and hopefully for the next races we can be in the top ten again
7764294 that was one of my hardest races ever because i have had a bad cold for the last two days but i had a good car and the right strategy and i think p7 was the best result we could have achieved today so im really happy i made up some places at the start and then just tried to do my race it was tough in the middle of the race and in the last 10 laps i pushed as hard as i could to stay concentrated considering our qualifying and my condition i am happy its a great result for the team to get both cars into the points for the constructors championship
7764295 im pretty happy with that its good to be going home with a point today as its been a long time since it happened the race went quite well for me and i was giving it my all driving what felt like qualifying laps one after the other the result is also good for the team as it shows we are getting back on track once again i would like to say that valencia has done a great job here and the race was good fun
7764296 this was one of the worst races ever for me to finish ninth in a car which is obviously good enough for third is a disaster after qualifying i was pretty confident because we realised we could go well but in the race i had big problems with the harder tyres during the first two stints and it was only better at the end with the softer compound i lost one position after the start and later in the race i couldnt gain any the pace wasnt there
7764297 that was a very nice race apart from the fact that i touched with heidfeld which broke my wing which was a real shame as i had to do 17 laps like that losing around 20 seconds to the group i was in the next two stints were good quality and i had a good pace but i am happy with the result and i think we had the right strategy its my best result since australia and especially from the second stint onwards i felt much more comfortable and confident with the car and felt i could push as the track rubbered in as for the next races i continue to tackle them one at a time and hope that next time out in spa i can make it into the points
7764298 the first lap was rough as i was in the middle of the pack and lost several positions after that i tried to fight back but my front wing was damaged and it was difficult to overtake its a shame that we couldnt get into the top ten but i hope we can have a better race in spa for the belgian grand prix in a couple of weeks time
7764299 we just werent quick enough we were hoping for a few safety cars to come out during the race so ran a one stop strategy but it didnt happen it was a difficult race pace wise and weve got a lot of analysis to do
7764300 i had a good start to the race and gained three places to 13th but that was the highlight of my race really we made things difficult for ourselves by qualifying so far back on the grid after we had expected to perform a lot better i was heavily fuelled compared to most others and running long on a one stop strategy but i was stuck behind heidfeld when he had already pitted which cost me some time as i didnt have the pace to overtake him we ran the option tyre for the second stint which was initially fine but then the rears went away quite badly due to the rear brakes overheating
7764301 it was a difficult race with the very hot conditions but overall i think it was a good performance the strategy wasnt bad but we did expect a safety car after seeing the other support races but there werent any incidents so it didnt come our pace was good it wasnt far off the others and we made a step forward with the gearbox we now have to keep focussed and keep moving forward
7764302 i had a bad start and we have to find the reason for that on lap one going into turns four and five i was just behind alonso but there was a bit of a battle going on in front and i couldnt avoid him going into the corner after that i just tried to be consistent my pace was ok but i was behind barrichello and it was really difficult to overtake eventually i made it past him and my pace improved but it was too late
7764303 after qualifying we took the opportunity to start from the pit lane and work on the car to try and resolve the issues that we had yesterday we changed the brakes completely so the car was very different to drive but it did improve a little bit during the race we need to get to the bottom of the brake problems that we have had all weekend as these cost me a lot of time and positions it was a poor weekend overall
7764304 i was hit from behind on the first lap i came back and passed a couple of cars but when i tried to pass one of the force indias i aborted the manoeuvre and made contact with them so sorry to them for that that damaged my barge board and the side of the car so after that the balance and downforce were very poor
7764305 not much to say after a day like this it was definitely not the weekend i was hoping for but i do not believe that despite this negative result i am now out of the running for the title there are still six races to go and sixty points up for grabs we have seen that the situation change really quickly even if i realize things are now more complicated today i lost a place at the start and i was stuck in traffic for all of the first stint then when i had a clear track ahead of me i was able to push and was doing good lap times at the second pit stop i made a mistake and left before i should have done fortunately pietro timpini is not too badly hurt i wish him all the best and hope he gets better soon in any case it would not have changed anything as then the engine broke now we must concentrate on preparing for the next rounds and on improving our qualifying performance
7764306 the first stint was okay as i was closing the gap to the rest of the field and then i could pass a few cars in the hairpin it was a shame that i couldnt pass giancarlo quickly enough to take full advantage of the two stop strategy and lost a little time once i passed him it was getting better but it was still difficult to pass more cars then under braking i lost the rear and tried to avoid a crash but the barrier was too close and that was it
7764307 when i first came and my brother dropped me off and said have a good day i was scared
7764308 its so different than elementary school but right away all these new people juniors and seniors said hi and treated me like family right away i felt like it was home
7764309 you get people with vested interests that dont have anything to do with education and in the public arena people have tenure and there are political pressures but people have to know that there are other ways of doing things that work we are constantly experimenting
7764310 if theres any crime at st genevieve i would be very surprised
7764311 what dan brought in was the idea that all of these kids are going to get a good education and go to college and that has a positive impact in this area of people respecting the school for many of the families their kids are the first ones to go to college and that gives them hope
7764312 st genevieve has a strong faculty good leadership clear vision and a success rate
7764313 location is a big part of it they provide one of the best options for parents looking for schools in that area

7764316 what really fascinated me was that the photograph that defined him that won him the pulitzer and made him famous was the photograph that really plagued him
7764317 he felt that in taking that photograph he had vilified a decent man
7764318 he would always say nicky you and me our pictures stopped the war
7764319 those are the three most important war pictures ever taken
7764320 those are seared into the mind of anyone who has ever seen them and will be forever those pictures will be as powerful 200 years from now as they were at the time
7764321 like a lot of us who have made pictures of that nature you didnt ever want to have to make that picture in your life
7764322 im sorry i had to make it but it had to be done i think eddies thing was the same
7764323 if you got in his way woe to you because he would just run you over

7764543 we are overwhelmed excited and its an honour for us to be recognised by careerseekers this is the third consecutive year as the recruiter of the year we are definitely doing something right
7764544 we are overwhelmed with the response from the candidates it goes to show what we put in will always be remembered by careerseekers
7764545 our partnership with careerjunction extends beyond these awards to providing comprehensive advertising solutions to the recruitment industry
7764546 im not sure what i want or the kids want
7764547 i think were starting the year with a great deal of hope a great deal of enthusiasm
7764548 last year was kind of a rough year to go through
7764549 you and what you do every day for the students that is the nashua school district
7764550 the nice thing is that all of the buildings have built around that
7764551 como si estuviera en un acto de profunda contemplaci n muy adecuado para un gobernante que era m s fil sofo que soldado
7764552 reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
7764553 you see barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is
7764554 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7764555 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7764556 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7764557 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7764558 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7764559 inspires me the way people tell me my father inspired them
7764560 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7764561 and barack and i set out to build lives guided by these values and pass them on to the next generation
7764562 those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7764563 seldom has an emerging leader so matched the needs of the moment
7764564 if you care about hillary youve got to work for sen obama
7764565 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7764566 i have a very honorable opponent there are stark differences between us
7764567 i know you have students who come from all over the world
7764568 i know there are people here who come from countries some from iraq where they have seen the look of war and sacrifice
7764569 hes been a fighter for the hispanic community hes been a fighter for the immigration issue
7764570 im not happy having sex offenders living next to my children
7764571 i used to let them play in the backyard with me at the kitchen window i cant do that anymore
7764572 there are 160 men in state prisons that are able to come home but they cant because they dont have anywhere to go
7764573 ultimately we need to find more homes for them in lancaster county
7764574 the decision of the borough is that may means may or may not
7764575 in this case the zoning officer decided that may means may not
7764576 we really need to get our arms around the issue so were looking at what really impacts public safety not what makes us feel better
7764577 its like putting 10 overweight people in a grocery store and saying dont go near the doughnuts
7764578 i dont lock my doors i dont lock my cars we dont have to but hes making it that kind of place and that bothers me
7764579 why cant they find an older home in lancaster county farmland rehab it grow tomatoes whatever
7764580 would they rather have me living on my own in an isolated area or in a mentored faith based home where im being monitored
7764581 ive paid my debt but society keeps footing the bill how is that beneficial for anyone
7764582 i want to become a part of the community and help the community

7764586 lo natural es bello lo artificial no y el da o es siempre el mismo el exceso
7764587 refrain from arresting or citing pot smokers during the convention
7764588 lets show manhunt what we in the gay community think of members of our community who support politicians who vote against the interests of the community
7764589 i believe mccain will be a better commander in chief than obama who also opposes gay marriage
7764590 if we have an experienced seasoned person defending the country in this dangerous age we will be able to argue about the gay agenda later
7764591 which is about the same as being an alabama democrat
7764592 it is too bad for the website if we lose customers but please never refer to me as a republican i consider it an offense
7764593 like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states red states for republicans blue states for democrats
7764594 for the first time in a long time we have the chance to build a new majority of not just democrats but independents and republicans whove lost faith in their washington leaders but want to believe again who desperately want something new
7764595 above all i searched for a leader who is ready to step in and be president
7764596 these people are like cancer and we must remove them
7764597 we cannot stand them and we detained many of them recently
7764598 give me the grace good lord to set the world at naught to set my mind fast upon thee and not to hang upon the blast of mens mouths to be content to be solitary not to long for worldly company but utterly to cast off the world and rid my mind of the business thereof
7764599 the ordinary acts we practice every day at home are of more importance to the soul than their simplicity might suggest
7764600 what does it avail to know that there is a god which you not only believe by faith but also know by reason what does it avail that you know him if you think little of him
7764601 nosso pai sempre nos levou para os est dios e a proximidade dos jogadores nos deixou com esse fetiche
7764602 its performances on the api and ap exams rank among the best in the state and parental involvement is unusually strong

7764604 devils postpile ranks as one of the worlds finest example of columnar basalt basalt lava erupted from todays postpile less than 100 000 years ago as the lava cooled it contracted and cracked forming vertical columns the symmetrical vertical and hexagonal columns formed because the cooling of the lava was slow and its mineral composition was consistent
7764605 hexagon is natures way of using the least length of line to enclose the most area as the lava that flowed devils postpile cooled it shrank then cracks were formed to relieve the stress meeting in three way conjunctions to form a pattern of hexagons with 120 degree angle
7764606 the polished floor was caused by the glacier that flowed down this area some 20 000 to 12 000 years ago the moving ice carved away one side of the postpile exposing a sheer wall of columns 60 feet high erosions and earthquakes later felled many columns that lie at the base of the monument
7764607 my goodness nature surely knows more than man about the concept of optimization and geometry
7764608 if there is a pull out or a turn over can we stop

7764614 oh did you hear about that cool new indie book
7764615 if some outside source outside myself doesnt publish my work it can never see the light of day or else everyone will assume im not a real writer
7764616 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7764617 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7764618 were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7764619 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads meth heads

7764627 desde el 30 de junio los precios de las acciones comunes de fannie mae y freddie mac han sufrido una gran volatilidad y han ca do considerablemente existe la opini n ampliamente extendida de que el gobierno respaldar a estas entidades promovidas por la administraci n si fuera necesario aunque no est claro si este apoyo se extender a a los accionistas
7764628 es posible que pudiera incurrir en cargas adicionales en el futuro
7764629 la amortizaci n total de las acciones preferentes de sovereign en gse entidades esponsorizadas por el gobierno podr a tener un impacto material en sus resultados
7764630 contin an existiendo porque el gobierno las respalda y no sobrevivir an sin este respaldo
7764631 do la sam ovdje kao supruga koja voli svoga mu a i vjeruje da e on biti izvanredan predsjednik
7764632 svi smo mi vo eni jednostavnim vjerovanjem da svijet kakav jest nije dovoljan da imamo obvezu boriti za svijet kakav bi trebao biti
7764633 to je nit koja povezuje na a srca to je nit koja prolazi kroz moje putovanje i barackovo putovanje i mnoga druga putovanja koja su nas dovela ve eras ovdje gdje se sada nja povijest susre e s novom plimom nade
7764634 mislim da je to bio izvrstan govor ne bih ni ta uklonio iz njega to je govor koji slu i ciljevima obamine kampanje
7764635 mnogi ljudi imaju bolesne o eve i bri ne majke i djecu a i lojalni su supru nicima
7764636 do ao sam ve eras ovamo da promijenimo ameriku da obnovimo njezinu budu nost da se uzdignemo do na ih najboljih ideala i da izaberemo baracka obamu za predsjednika sjedinjenih dr ava
7764637 nominacija je odlu ena imamo potpredsjednika radit emo zajedno i i i naprijed
7764638 life is about the people you meet the connections you make and the legacy you leave
7764639 the dual authority in the kosovo diocese has to end therefore our deeply thought through decisions were made and then resulted with an open mutiny in decani
7764640 he says it is a shame for him to look into peoples eyes
7764641 he is ashamed that his army has turned into this group of bandits
7764642 we all love georgia and we all feel nervous about this situation
7764643 in this mutual fighting and these mutual victims we feel like we are losing something and of course we feel sad about that
7764644 russia often says they must defend their citizens in georgia
7764645 its doubly painful for me because my roots my compatriots are doing this
7764646 in the future we will be asked where we stood during this war we are citizens of georgia and i think the majority of us think this way its not nice to be objects of manipulation like what happened in abkhazia and south ossetia
7764647 she told me you are inventing it now they are silent maybe they are afraid to say anything
7764648 my neighbors say hello to me in the same way when we watch tv and we see these corpses sometimes they say curses but theyre not directed at me
7764649 i dont want that someone may call my children something because theyre russian
7764650 the local russians are ashamed of those russians who came
7764651 there wont be any problems for russians theyve never done anything but good here
7764652 trevor mcdonald george whatshisface the guy that does news 24 on sunday afternoons and of course hugh edwards
7764653 alright hugh edwards isnt a black woman but he is welsh which is basically the same thing
7764654 jeremy paxman has raised an important issue why the fuck is anyone still listening to this arsehole
7764655 people seem to think hes really deep and intelligent because he asked michael howard the same question 600 times in a row i still think he was pissed
7764656 if hes not defiling university challenge hes writing to marks and sparks about his undies like some kind of pervert freak living in a big glass tube can add 40 years to your life say experts
7764657 we have been forced to take this decision which we take with great regret
7764658 zardari pledged in writing to reinstate the judges within one day of musharraf leaving
7764659 i thought then and i still do what a heroic act
7764660 my feeling in 1976 is the same as it is today that two individuals were wrong in desecrating a symbol of the rights and freedoms that we have
7764661 if you model it like 2004 youre going to completely miss whats happening
7764662 in pennsylvania we found that the people who are newly registered turned out at a higher rate than people previously registered
7764663 every national poll you see is based on the 2004 electorate
7764664 i dont like to bet but id bet you the 2008 electorate is going to be changed in some pretty fundamental ways
7764665 we have great strength in pennsylvania and were going to be there in great force
7764666 even though sen clinton beat us in the primary we clearly benefited from the time we spent there
7764667 theres a depth of understanding about who sen obama is that is greater than in other places
7764668 im much more concerned with communicating how i intend to help middle class families live their lives
7764669 a skinny kid with a funny name who believes that america has a place for him too
7764670 i dont think you can duplicate that kind of moment
7764671 and when she was working and going to school at the same time there were a few patches there where she had to get food stamps to make sure that we had enough to eat
7764672 so i know what youve gone through and thats why im in politics politics didnt bring me to working people working people brought me to politics
7764673 we were not all on the same side as democrats but we are now
7764674 the fact is we had a very hard fought primary
7764675 there are going to be some of sen clintons supporters we have to work hard to persuade to come on board thats not surprising
7764676 the clintons love this country they love the democratic party and they are going to be active participants in our campaign for the remaining 70 days
7764677 bill clinton knows a little bit about trying to yank the economy out of the doldrums
7764678 it wouldnt make sense for me to want to edit his remarks
7764679 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7764680 our parking lots are full even on nice sunny days were very proud of that
7764681 this park and zoo not only does its part in preserving open space and wetlands in an area where that is shrinking its also always been a place where families can come and enjoy an entire day together without spending very much
7764682 i dont think that even covers the enjoyment we get out of coming here
7764683 you may hear more about zoos like the san diego zoo or the bronx but its really in many small and medium sized zoos like cape may countys where important works like the bongo repatriation project are going on
7764684 its within these smaller facilities that the expertise and the care for these kinds of projects resides
7764685 i brought my kids here when they were little and now theyre 34 and i bring my grandchildren here i cant believe what they started with and now what they have here now you could spend all day
7764686 after all was the person who authored some time ago the philosophy that said a surge would work in iraq
7764687 also dovetails nicely with the escalating cult of personality over mccain and the surge
7764688 successful touchdown drive that the washington redskins completed last season in
7764689 has anyone noticed that mr romney says in 50 words what could be said i10
7764690 during my tenure in the united states senate i took the initiative in creating the surge
7764691 i cant guarantee it will succeed but i can guarantee catastrophe if we fail or continue the present strategy
7764692 as most people know we have gone in to clear and left and the insurgents have returned this is a chance under the new leadership of general petraeus and admiral fallon to have a chance to succeed do i believe it can succeed yes i do
7764693 you are freed through the mercy of the lord for whose sake you were asked to show mercy to the wilderness brethren
7764694 i pledge to you that i will be there next january on the floor of the united states senate
7764695 my fellow democrats my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7764696 i have come here tonight to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7764697 as i look ahead i am strengthened by family and friendship
7764698 so many of you have been with me in the happiest days and the hardest days
7764699 together we have known success and seen failure victory and defeat
7764700 for me this is a season of hope new hope and this is the cause of my life new hope that we will break the old gridlock
7764701 i never thought when i graduated from college in 1965 that i would end my life without seeing a woman president
7764702 when you work really hard for somebody it is disappointing and tough when they dont win
7764703 there are a number of people who are feeling a sense of loss
7764704 i think that the level of animosity is far less this year than there was in 1984
7764705 the animosity there did not end with the convention and it continued on through the general election
7764706 that was a long primary contest too this one there is far less rancor
7764707 i think the national press is stoking it a bit more than what is going on down on the ground
7764708 adjustments have been made but it is along the same lines of events that weve had in the past
7764709 that is not to say that there will be no parties at the conventions
7764710 i dont like the role of stepping in and being a party pooper
7764711 it is the members of congress that will have to face the consequences of any violations
7764712 to date we have succeeded in connecting broadband customers living as far as 7 5 km from the exchange
7764713 we have a 1982 easement with peco energy from township line road in cromby up to fricks lock
7764714 from fricks lock north is where we are negotiating with landowners
7764715 our goal is to sign it uniformly and find access points and trailheads
7764716 thats important when you have a regional trail with thousands of visitors a day
7764717 there was a real opportunity missed there to hear from somebody who really understood what it was like to fight for the powerless that was his life i want to speak to some of those same concerns he had
7764718 youve got to be economical with your words though and the longer youre in the senate the more long winded you get
7764719 people dont know his story weve got to show them his heart his story of overcoming obstacles
7764720 i think because hes so eloquent and graceful people dont know he had to struggle
7764721 senators from both parties will tell you that hes always been willing to listen to other points of view
7764722 thanks for taking my calls when you knew i was calling to ask for money
7764723 youll always be my hero because you were willing to take on santorum
7764724 internet provides groups in society with means to communicate organize and obtain good information which is not controlled by government but only a tiny percentage of african populations have access to internet
7764725 during the 2006 local government elections in senegal radio sud used reporters and correspondents with cell phones to call in what they saw i remember hearing one reporter describing how a local party boss was illegally taking a ballot box on his truck from the polling station this was reported live as it was happening
7764726 parallel reporting was important in zimbabwe it kept them from coming straight out and reporting a false result all of this technology is very important and gives a powerful new tool that cuts the ability for cheating
7764727 this is a world war ii battleship with high fixed costs for maintenance and theres the cost of running the museum and utilities 720 000 a year its an expensive place to run
7764728 for the 3 million the state was getting back 9 2 million in economic impact
7764729 if the state wants to see vibrant cultural and historical museums in the state theres a level of support thats needed
7764730 each of these sites and activities are equally important to fueling the states economy
7764731 the liberty science center in jersey city was cut by 2 7 million and the newark museum lost 2 2 million
7764732 the goal of the budget was to take steps to fix state finances so we could match recurring spending with recurring revenues reduce state debt and ease the structural budget shortfall
7764733 the focus was to preserve core programs that service our seniors and other vulnerable populations
7764734 we are dependent on the states help so this is a big blow to us
7764735 its been a rough month we will have to do a better job of bringing in more money well have to work harder
7764736 we will have to handle tasks in much different ways assess operational priorities we will probably have some limited hours during the winter we will still have groups and encampments for a day
7764737 we are not a philadelphia based museum with main line support from wealthy contributors
7764738 i had to keep giving her the bad news over and over again
7764739 every time it finally sank in that she had lost her husband of more than 50 years shed look at me sadly and say oh as i struggled to compose myself
7764740 watching her struggle with her words and her memory i couldnt believe it
7764741 broadly its a right of centre industry i know this because i was once a sony radio awards judge and they gave me 24 hours of tapes to listen to the pattern seemed to be that you got an old journalist and they would do an opening rant about myra hindley too many immigrants and put all homosexuals on a small island and drop a bomb then every bigot in the land would phone in an absolutely pointless exercise
7764742 london is 10 years younger than the national average theres a huge concentration of young people and theyre all having sex its the most fecund place in britain
7764743 over the last three months the only place you could get really good coverage of city hall was on the blogs
7764744 they havent got off their backsides and logged on to answer all this right wing drivel
7764745 the liberal democrat ams site is fast achieving cult status as surfers check out the latest musings on his personal web log
7764746 highly readable and in part quite entertaining the website is certainly worth a visit
7764747 a double espresso of dull this is a man who has almost cornered the market in pedestrian prose and who unwittingly mimics the what i had for breakfast blog so beloved of the mainstream media
7764748 thats some of things that should be talked about on a regular basis and taught in schools
7764749 the display was caused by clouds in nebraska casting their shadows towards me here in missouri
7764750 the display began about 20 minutes after sunset and lasted for only a few minutes just long enough for a snapshot with my
7764751 do you know where the crapper is i have to do something mysterious in there drop off some timber
7764752 the other hotels around the area all have health care that is provided by the boss and have been able to get wage increases
7764753 at the other hotels in the same classification for the same work the workers get paid 2 to 3 an hour more
7764754 clearly were disappointed that unite here local 681 has spent more time protesting
7764755 publicity stunts are not productive and are extremely disruptive to the resort district
7764756 disneyland is being unfair with us because were fighting for our health care and theyre trying to take it away
7764757 theyre trying to cut our hours and take away our seniority
7764758 the guards suspected the animal might be involved in drug smuggling once they noticed four prisoners visibly intoxicated shortly after the pigeon landed on a prison window
7764759 we suspect that the pigeon carried the drugs from tuzla
7764760 we do not know what to do with the pigeon but for the time being it will remain behind bars
7764761 for the past few days our phone has just been ringing off the hook
7764762 victoria takes her position as a role model to young women very seriously and is horrified by this hurtful fabricated story it is now with her lawyers

7764771 to not be limited in any respect due to gender
7764772 i dont have one i just live my life not considering gender when making my decisions
7764773 i think canadians will have a better appreciation of why we have become so stereotyped that were lazy or losers or drunkards or whatever this resulted from a very destructive oppressive colonization of aboriginal people
7764774 residential schools were about destroying our political systems destroying our religious systems destroying our communities our cultures our livelihood they largely succeeded
7764775 if they dont listen it will be a tragedy i think once and for all we as aboriginal people will be certain that canadians simply dismiss us as nothing important that would be the worst insult of all
7764776 we will be able to say in the words of archbishop desmond tutu we have looked the beast in the eye we have come to terms with our horrendous past and it will no longer keep us hostage

7764780 the convention is our preparation for taking on the republicans this fall and one of our challenges is to more fully introduce barack obama to the american people thats what tonight is about the convention is also about building teamwork among the party leadership harnessing the efforts toward the goal of winning the election
7764781 my fathers a us navy officer and used to be a strong supporter of john mccain hes still a republican im not sure whether hell vote for obama this fall but hes thinking a lot about it and he seems to understand why im so committed to obama and to the change he represents
7764782 one of obamas strengths will be that hell encourage cooperation with our international partners particularly the european union on a wide range of global issues
7764783 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7764784 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7764785 were aware of the matter discussed tonight by the aurora police department
7764786 federal law enforcement is working hand in glove with the aurora police department because this matter is currently under investigation there is little we can say right now
7764787 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7764788 in this environment the importance of having long life reserves and resources is critical and rio tinto is particularly advantaged in this regard
7764789 the driver of demand for our products is urbanisation and industrialisation in heavily populated countries like china and india and these economies continue to grow strongly
7764790 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side that continues to face multiple constraints
7764791 we continue to make good progress with the integration of the alcan assets that we acquired in 2007
7764792 we are on track to deliver annual synergies of us1 1 billion 1 28 billion after tax from the end of 2009 considerably higher than our initial estimate of us600 million
7764793 globally the group has plans to increase iron ore production to over 600 million tonnes per annum including growth in canada brazil and guinea
7764794 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone value proposition for shareholders
7764795 as countermeasures in a situation where the united states violated the agreement
7764796 in the past north korea has made a lot of threats on this issue
7764797 when it comes to negotiating they really do like to use threats against the other five parties
7764798 the best news ive heard for a long time is that john mayer is single i wouldnt have given him a second glance but all that changed when i saw him perform live on tv recently with his top off i had to be calmed down

7764804 we can say this were absolutely confident there is no credible threat to the candidate the democratic national convention or the people of colorado
7764805 its going to be very interesting indeed where the credibility stakes now hang in this place in terms of those opposite and their behaviour in the senate as they begin to launch their assault on this nations best fiscal preparedness for what will be uncertain global economic times ahead
7764806 for the foreseeable future with continued poor mortgage liquidity limiting housing market activity
7764807 in the light of current difficult trading conditions the board considers this reduction to be a prudent action to take

7764881 avoid top 20 ways to screw up in the gym
7764882 i have a great opportunity to come up here and play and i didnt get to play as much as i wanted to last year
7764883 im glad to get a chance to show my stuff you always want to play as much as you can
7764884 having kevin is really going to give a boost to our club and thats first from a confidence standpoint in the room
7764885 he also brings intangibles like winning a memorial cup we dont have that in the room right now were looking for those things but at the end of the day we want him to stop the puck the goalies job after all is to stop the puck and were expecting big things out of him im sure hell deliver
7764886 it was a long run and a good run to the memorial cup and i got to see how leadership from the older guys is very important
7764887 you need the whole team to do it even have the younger guys chipping in its a team thing
7764888 im going to stick to my game play the way i play i had a good healthy competition with tokarski last year and it pushed us both to maximize our potential and in the end he was a bit better and got on a roll down the stretch he did a great job
7764889 ian and i have talked a bit and he seems like a good guy
7764890 having cuba confirm is really a dream come true for our committee and should japan give the go ahead we will have accomplished something very special
7764891 that lineup of teams is the a list we brought into the planning stage and we are truly honored to be this close to making it a reality
7764892 this is a country that once sported a 129 game winning streak in international baseball and has appeared in the final in the last 52 tournaments it has entered
7764893 they are skilled they are well trained and they are disciplined there is no question they will come to prince george as the favourite and that the other five teams will have to be at their best to dethrone them
7764894 i can really appreciate who they are and what theyve done and how good their players are
7764895 its kind of like getting to play the new york yankees or boston red sox their players are good enough to be on major league teams what hockey is to canada baseball is to cuba so its a big thing to get to play on the same field and get to play against them
7764896 to get any bigger than that you would have to bring the yankees or the red sox in to play
7764897 there is going to be a little star struck feeling and a little awe maybe in warmup and maybe watching them play but i think once you get down to playing the game guys are good enough and guys will be able to go out and compete against them the best they can
7764898 i dont want to be traded but ive thought about how it could play out
7764899 ive heard about it and some players have asked me i have no idea i just want to focus on this team and hopefully stay here we want to definitely have a better start then a better finish it was a lot of fun to go deep in the playoffs a lot more fun than missing the playoffs
7764900 i had a great summer worked out hard and got bigger while also leaning out
7764901 playing in the world junior is a big goal for me but ive told everyone the coaches and players i dont want to worry about tampa i just want to think about having a good season for the cougars and play well here
7764902 its definitely different with the new ownership and im going to have to see what happens
7764903 if you wont save me please dont waste my time
7764904 se non mi salvi per favore non farmi perdere tempo
7764905 the guys have come into the beginning of the season way ahead of where we were last year as far as fitness and commitment level and it showed on the field this weekend
7764906 with four starters missing from last year we did really good
7764907 theyve got 13 players returning and i felt we had the majority of the game we had a goal disallowed because of a dubious offside call we hit the post too and they had one opportunity that they buried and that was the difference
7764908 he was all over the field this guy is a real difference maker in games he can really set the tempo and the tone of a game all on his own hes an excellent player sandro was terrific and tyson williams fit in extremely well at this level hes a highly skilled player
7764909 when shes on shes technically a really talented player but then she tends to shy away occasionally hopefully we can get this consistency shes older and has a little bit of experience under her belt playing for grande prairie for two years i expect her to be a force in that offensive area
7764910 all 16 year olds are tough to stick in our league
7764911 i think last year in the league there were less than a dozen of them on all teams combined typically this league is an older league than even the western hockey league for players dylan has had a great camp hes a player were going to play tonight and see where we are after that
7764912 dylan is someone whos definitely on our radar and hes done enough this weekend during training camp that we see him eventually being a spruce king if not this year perhaps next
7764913 im used to playing with bigger guys im not exactly the tallest guy out there
7764914 there are a lot of good players at this camp so ill have to wait and see what happens
7764915 o k i see alright if thats how its gonna be i can play that way too
7764916 we wanted to respect the neighbors desire to make the building go away but wanted to make sure we werent making hiding places for anyone were doing landscape design that will create a good environment for the students as well
7764917 human remains which rescuers gathered into 65 bags are almost impossible to identify unfortunately kyrgyzstan does not have a special service and equipment to make dna analysis and iran offered help
7764918 one does not have to explain the emotional state of the victims relatives so we must conduct dna tests identify bodies and hand them over to the victimss families as quickly as possible
7764919 but to rule out mistakes we decided to send those bodies to tehran for dna testing too

7764927 can you give me one good reason not to quit
7764928 in the third year there was still nothing from the bamboo seed
7764929 then in the fifth year a tiny sprout emerged from the earth compared to the fern it was seemingly small and insignificant but just 6 months later the bamboo rose to over 100 feet tall it had spent the five years growing roots those roots made it strong and gave it what it needed to survive i would not give any of my creations a challenge it could not handle
7764930 did you know my child that all this time you have been struggling you have actually been growing roots
7764931 the bamboo had a different purpose than the fern yet they both make the forest beautiful
7764932 i left the forest and bring back this story i hope these words can help you see that god will never give up on you he will never give up on you never regret a day in your life good days give you happiness bad days give you experiences both are essential to life a happy and meaningful life requires our continuous input and creativity it does not happen by chance it happens because of our choices and actions and each day we are given new opportunities to choose and act and in doing so we create our own unique journey

7764980 im sorry maam but i usually get up too late sleeping from my morning class
7764981 you know class your intelligence and your course is not the measure of your success success depends on what you do and on how you will strive and do your best for your future
7764982 even though youre the most intelligent person in the class you wont succeed if you do such things that will ruin your studies
7764983 when are you coming home cuz there is no need for the window to be opened for 2 hrs before you get home its not safe
7764984 any of these balloons coming into contact with power lines can cause a flash even a spark that causes an outage
7764985 there were more attributed to poorly maintained lines squirrels tree trimming and equipment failures
7764986 balloons at best or worst were attributed to a few hundred of the tens of thousands of power outages each year
7764987 its a fact of life and one that we will continue to address
7764988 mylar balloons are a good chunk of our business outside of all the items we sell during the halloween season so weve been against this bill for a long time
7764989 theres just something special about these balloons that cant be replaced
7764990 i am going to get some advice but i think i might wade in here to set some of the record straight with the media
7764991 we are being crucified on why the taser usage and our members actions at the preliminary stages
7764992 sgt pierre lemaitre should be fired for purposely misrepresenting the facts and suppressing the video on a false premise
7764993 it appears you have been caught in an outright lie
7764994 in my experience they sexual refugees are more willing to put forward a political case though it is more weak
7764995 i think what is interesting about the decision is the way they construe the right to be gay
7764996 they basically say that it is a private right and that if gay people express themselves privately it is sufficient its a very narrow view
7764997 the problem is when you get in front of a h ome a ffairs official
7764998 does he hate queers does she fear lesbians their application could go to the bottom of the pile
7764999 when they found out shes transgender they pushed her out of the queue
7765000 i love my country but its not easy to live there when you have made a different choice and when you are dreaming of a new sun
7765001 in my country people look at you like a witch they will tell you to pray to god because you have some bad spirit or trouble in your mind
7765002 they treat me like in my home country just today i met a lady from my country who asked me why i was a lesbian why am i not trying to date white men
7765003 she came here because she thought it was better for gays and lesbians
7765004 the house of representatives through a member proposed a bribe of 500 000
7765005 we did not take this man and his offer seriously until an advance sum of 200 000 00 two hundred thousand usd in cash was delivered to his camp late sunday night august 24 at 2245 hrs
7765006 mend has no intention of returning the money which will be put to better use and will not connive with the nigerian government through its dishonorable lower house to perpetrate such a wicked and criminal conspiracy against an innocent company
7765007 it certainly has given our kids a sense of pride we feel like our facilities are up to speed with anyone in our conference now
7765008 the fact theyre close is going to bring more people to games more notoriety to our program i see it already working
7765009 i think it creates a sense of unity within your team when you have that many guys that know each other pretty soon it becomes the popular thing to go to sacramento state because a lot of other guys are doing it it can be contagious
7765010 our offensive line was kind of a patchwork deal last year where we had to put together tight ends and a jc transfer that was a nose guard
7765011 i really think if were able to stay healthy and continue working hard and stay together as a team and develop from week to week i think we can be pretty good
7765012 my motto i kind of force upon the team playoffs or bust
7765013 but i dont think anyone could beat us our team was full of hall of famers legends a number of our guys had won nba championships plus we had that mystique and thats never coming back
7765014 i saw those red spots on his face thats the pressure see what we started
7765015 if we had faced the zone that they 2008 team did sunday against spain
7765016 i would have put chris mullin on one wing and bird on the other that would have been it
7765017 i read somewhere that theyre building 10 000 basketball courts in china
7765018 yeah its different but its football its cool and i love it
7765019 do you realize we havent won a bowl since 1949
7765020 sir surely you dont deny that you routinely overcharged your clients that you cheated on your wife with your law clerks and associates and that you used your position as a partner to pressure those clerks and associates into becoming involved with you surely you dont deny that you deliberately took false positions in court in order to win cases where any sense of ethics would have caused you to settle and theres so much more here why surely
7765021 yes yes i know all of that but ive done some charity in my life as well
7765022 i think our goal right now is to convince them that we have the veteran population that we have and continue to have problems processing claims in hawaii and we want to do that here on guam
7765023 the last census that was done was in 2000 and that census stated that there was approximately 8 400 veterans we believe today that there is 14 500 around that number
7765024 the playing field is not level it never has been level for veterans living on guam
7765025 i know of many veterans that simply will not go and follow through on the va process because they simply cannot afford it and they just give up
7765026 an abrupt switch from late nights to early mornings can set the stage for irregular sleep patterns that can sap the alertness and energy vital to school performance
7765027 its important to foster good sleep habits within the days leading up to the first day of school
7765028 from family bike rides to a friendly game of tag or a walk to the park after dinner the important thing is to make fitness fun
7765029 children are not always forthcoming with and many times not able to identify whats causing them to be unhappy or unproductive
7765030 communication is key to helping your child recognize stress and anxiety and work towards a solution
7765031 these assessments are integral in the detection of health conditions that could cause serious illness
7765032 since recommendations can change throughout the year be sure to stay up on recommendations and check in with your pediatrician if its been awhile since your childs last physical
7765033 just take it game by game and dont worry about how many games youre down if we take care of business and keep on taking care of business every day everything else will take care of itself
7765034 we just did not execute well at home early and we didnt execute well on the road early weve been on a nice little roll now
7765035 im making better pitches now than i was before im commanding my fastball a lot better and im able to stay ahead in a lot more counts
7765036 just because youve clinched the title doesnt give you a reason to not play well
7765037 im always calling the pitching coach rick rodriguez over to check out my pitches
7765038 dinardo got ahead of guys and left some pitches over the plate
7765039 he just couldnt find a pitch to get guys out
7765040 but we have a 12 game home winning streak that we hope translates into continued success on friday nights
7765041 se siente lindo estar puntero pero hay que mantener la calma quedan 35 partidos todav a venimos haciendo las cosas bien y debemos seguir de esa manera
7765042 no hay ninguna materia pendiente para nada fue un resultado que se dio que quedar para la estad stica y nada m s no podemos quedar a pensar en las cosas buenas del torneo pasado y menos en las malas ya est tenemos que mirar para adelante sabiendo que vamos a enfrentar a un rival muy bien armado y vamos con la intenci n de seguir por la buena senda

7765049 not only are individual economies better prepared to weather a sudden stop of capital flows but the risk of financial contagion in the region may have decreased as a result of the reserve accumulation
7765050 the average optimal level of reserves for asia is estimated at around six months of imports twice as large as the traditional benchmark three months estimated optimal ratios for indonesia india china and taiwan province of china are above six months
7765051 for instance chinas reserves before 2004 had not reached the optimal level predicted by the model and india breached the threshold in 2003

7765054 die zukunft der medizin liegt nicht in der behandlung von krankheiten sondern im erkennen der ursachen von krankheiten
7765055 es mangelt der deutschen gesundheitspolitik nach wie vor an einer expliziten zielorientierung
7765056 keine definierten organisationsformen f r die vernetzten praxen die vielf ltigen und oft sehr unterschiedlichen aktivit ten seien eher als bewegung zu verstehen
7765057 nicht in der lage sei sein praktisches rztliches handeln an der einsicht in die rztlichen gegebenheiten auszurichten der kl ger sei durch wahn hnliche gewissheit seine wissenschaftlichen erkenntnisse seien unantastbar gepr gt
7765058 mittels der evidenzbasierten medizin l sst sich ein h herer qualit tsanspruch sicherstellen denn die wirksamkeit eines arzneimittels oder einer therapieform muss durch belege das hei t durch eine ausreichende evidenz in form von wissenschaftlichen untersuchungen nachgewiesen sein

7765061 in the best case scenario this would open up the window of time that people could recover and go back to normal functional status

7765063 when most people think of switching out their office to one linux distribution or another the very idea of getting started with 10 must have linux and not only cheat sheets
7765064 the intent of this quick reference guide is to provide a starting point for linux and sex battle it out in utah
7765065 even though the data is apparently a bit screwy i was still really proud to see utah emerge as the top state for
7765066 its interesting that somehow the original post was seen as criticism of linux whereas it targeted the mozilla foundation
7765067 it appears that the parents of a newborn at risk of contracting hepatitis b have not presented their baby for medical treatment
7765068 according to medical advice there is no longer sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of any vaccination
7765069 your treatment of the deceased was brutal in the extreme
7765070 you stomped on her you hit her with a hose and you took a stick or some other object and impaled her
7765071 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7765072 we shall do all that is possible to save them
7765073 they are besides themselves and feeling helpless but they are trying to stay positive
7765074 prime minister kevin rudd and consumer affairs minister chris bowen must acknowledge the absurdity of grocerychoice and shut the site down immediately
7765075 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7765076 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7765077 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7765078 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores
7765079 what that tells us is that consumers believe it is of no use at all
7765080 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
7765081 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
7765082 girls and young women need to be protected from their own immaturity and sexual curiousity at that vulnerable age
7765083 wow why dont you just call yourself a fucking fagget
7765084 reports are that she approached the ips iraqi police saying she had the vest on and didnt want to go through with it
7765085 if she was forced to put on the vest or if she did it voluntarily that is still being reviewed
7765086 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7765087 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7765088 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year
7765089 the housing ministry initiated 433 new housing units during the period of january to may 2008 compared to just 240 units during the period january to may 2007
7765090 nope gotta wait six months how you like them apples
7765091 for almost 8 years and he still hasnt proposed hes told me im the one he wants to marry for the majority of the relationship lets say 5 years i didnt want to get married i was too young early 20s but now im older almost 30 and i want that commitment
7765092 in the beginning we both knew that we were going to be with each other for a long time
7765093 whats wrong with thinking youre too young to get married we both want the same thing thats why im wondering whats with the prolonging
7765094 you have taught your boyfriend for eight straight years your version of what love and committment is all about fear of committment
7765095 you have taught him how your version of love is suppose to work by the tone of your letter i am sure you can see much clearer now the reason for why you chose to stay with this person he is the you you so much wanted to become and now now that you have positioned him in that place where you had wanted to be where you feel comfortable changing in mid stream his mind will require a real life changing moment for the two of you
7765096 you are about to learn how breaking him of the lesson you have apparently expressed well will be undoubtedly very tough
7765097 like i said when we meet people to love in a relationship we are meeting the people who best represent the best of what we see in ourselves
7765098 he is the you you had wanted to be for these last eight years
7765099 i am not trying to be difficult i am trying to let you know how over the last few years you have taught him how comfortable your relationship has been in its present state from the very beginning as you said you knew the two of you would be together for a real long time i think that it is great you have apparently shared a very meaningful and even relationship for all this time
7765100 your apparent choice to not get married young was a good thing most of us are pretty clueless about how love works in our early twenties however a whole new set of life realities exists as you draw closer to the big 3 0
7765101 a man sees those years as a time to make his mark because his forties are right around the corner so he views his marriage or relationships a tad different
7765102 women in my view are far and away a little more advanced in their understanding of who they are then men so the 30 thirties are a time when your passion for life rise you are actually going to become even more passionate about loving him should he still be around
7765103 all this passion in a woman at this time for a man can be a scary thing

7765110 we need to change the perception of how the world looks at us as a country and a basketball power and we have to reclaim what we lost
7765111 its a lot about how they look how they act on and off the court the only way to change the perception is to have people doing the right thing and thats the goal
7765112 there was a lot of second guessing about whether a college coach like mike krzyzewski could coach nba players and about whether the pros would work hard and play together as a team
7765113 it has been such an honor representing our country and really being with all those players
7765114 the players were amazing on the court and off the court they representing us very well

7765143 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells

7765170 you get people with vested interests that dont have anything to do with education and in the public arena people have tenure and there are political pressures but people have to know that there are other ways of doing things that work we are constantly experimenting
7765171 if theres any crime at st genevieve i would be very surprised
7765172 what dan brought in was the idea that all of these kids are going to get a good education and go to college and that has a positive impact in this area of people respecting the school for many of the families their kids are the first ones to go to college and that gives them hope

7765248 i have come to believe that there are basically six kinds of songs six ways that we use music in our lives six broad categories of music no less
7765249 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7765250 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7765251 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration

7765283 he sat down at the table with me he said i apologize and lets move forward i accepted his apology and said ok we will it was never my intention to continue things that would hurt barack obama
7765284 i said if thats what you think i said i dont want to have no hard feelings so i apologize
7765285 i think its a misuse of words theres no uncle toms anybody supporting hillary obama its just a mischoice of words

7765294 tutti i corrispondenti stranieri stavano dallaltra parte in georgia mentre qui si moriva le nostre vittime le nostre rovine perch nessuno viene a vederle
7765295 reazione eccessiva se non fosse stato per i russi oggi lossezia del sud non esisterebbe pi ci hanno messo fin troppo ad arrivare
7765296 quando abbiamo sentito che i georgiani attaccavano siamo scesi anche noi armati alla belle meglio in tanti volevamo dare una mano ma quando ci si messa lartiglieria pesante i carri e gli aerei di qua e di l siam tornati indietro impauriti
7765297 ha solo 10 giorni e il fratello di due non parla pi da quando ha sentito le salve georgiane
7765298 perch qui vivevamo bene coi georgiani come vicini e amici senza nessun problema quel pazzo di saakashvili ci si messo in mezzo e ora non ho nulla contro di loro nessuno dei civili voleva questa assurda guerra ma e difficile dimenticare quei giorni di terrore inutile
7765299 condoleeza rice dice che sud ossezia e abkhazia sono georgia venga qui a vedere cosa ci hanno fatto lamerica vuole insidiare i confini della russia e piazzare una base qui contro liran ma non ce la faranno perch i russi sono forti ci hanno aiutato mentre la georgia ha piu volte chiuso i canali con noi tagliandoci persino lacqua
7765300 ce lhai un amico caro uno con cui dividi il pane a colazione tutti i giorni se un giorno uccide un tuo parente cosa fai
7765301 da qui sono entrati i georgiani quella notte con molti carri e mezzi hanno rapito 6 nostri uomini nessuno ci dice che fine han fatto se dobbiamo andare a mosca lo faremo
7765302 mosca sempre mosca scusateci ma non nostra competenza son prigionieri civili e non militari
7765303 passeggiavamo insieme qui coi georgiani ci tira in disparte volodja mamiev seduto sotto un pero coi nipoti piegati sui talloni intorno alla caucasica qui vivevano 10 famiglie loro e ora

7765307 you cant short circuit the process of holding folk accountable just because you fall in love
7765308 is a personal friend of mind im excited as a black man about this moment
7765309 the closer you get to power the more truth gets sacrificed
7765310 i recognize that barack obama is not trying to be a black president but there ought to be an urban agenda
7765311 after the 21st after his inauguration youre still going to lose your house
7765312 i understand the love that black people have for obama i get that
7765313 i think the way you make the president a good president is when you make them acountable
7765314 theres something you should look into its happening in the heritage department and its what the tories are doing to the funding of film and television look at the transcripts of heritage committee hearings
7765315 everyone involved in the show always expected wed return for another season but it still feels good to hear it
7765316 flashpoint has hit its mark with north american audiences and remained competitive even during the olympics
7765317 the cast and creative team delivered a series that not only entertains with high intensity but with heart as well
7765318 there has never been a commitment of this magnitude to covering the games in this country or maybe anywhere in the world
7765319 consumers will be able to watch what they want when they want and how they want
7765320 the performances of the athletes combined with the location being in canada combined with the multimedia options really tickles our spine
7765321 the americans were at 152 so right now were the second best winter nation and we know that the better your team does the stronger your ratings will be
7765322 so the combination of our team poised for success combined with the location and the time zone and the multimedia options its very easy to get excited
7765323 over a number of years weve heard complaints from neighborhood leaders about not getting requested information on a timely basis or simply never getting the information they requested and finally giving up
7765324 even if we had never received a complaint we would have thought there should be such a policy that holds all city departments accountable for responding timely and thoroughly to requests for public records
7765325 when it comes to kids we cant do too much thats the outlook that we have
7765326 people were nice enough when i came along to make sure i had what i needed when much is given much is required
7765327 when you take the time to build their outer beauty it builds their self esteem
7765328 we want them to feel good about themselves when they get up tomorrow to go to school they have enough to be concerned with we dont want them to worry about how they look
7765329 i wanted to have my hair done but at first i didnt know if i was going to be able to get it done
7765330 theres something about a nice haircut or a nice hairstyle
7765331 something about that that gives a kid a sense of hey im as important as everybody else
7765332 i didnt know what a latino was in those days
7765333 the audience and the context for the show have changed so much
7765334 i had some anger when i was growing up here but i had a lot of happiness too
7765335 we were in a different part of the world where it was wet and green and where people were different
7765336 and being in the south in the 1960s and 1970s that was an issue
7765337 i felt i was living in a city and state in which injustice was part of the reality
7765338 i was amazed that a ninth grader could do something like that
7765339 van gogh taught me that an artist should always be close to nature and nature was always a very real part of growing up in north carolina
7765340 it taught me to follow my own nature and not be distracted from what i really want to do
7765341 up until that point i had trouble blending those two differences intellectually and emotionally
7765342 not always in an obvious way but i try to weave them together whenever the opportunity presents itself
7765343 its a difficult situation for immigrants with illegal status all they have is their humanity which is lost in the shrill debate about immigration
7765344 what i do has nothing to do with supporting or not supporting illegal immigration i am commenting on the emerging reality
7765345 i am bringing this artwork and saying this is who i am and this is who i have become
7765346 it is thrilling for him to be able to have that here to show his belief in human rights
7765347 when we lived here i dont believe it would have been acceptable but it was well received
7765348 i never thought it would inspire him to have his work exhibited
7765349 we have different backgrounds but our diverse backgrounds blend together and make us good friends
7765350 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7765351 only because we couldnt figure out how to get to the south there were a couple of states in the way
7765352 it gives law enforcement another tool to deal with people they might find at our parks and recreation facilities that dont seem to have a reason to be there
7765353 its something we need to be aware of to protect the children in that jurisdiction
7765354 i dont think there is anybody in north carolina who would dispute that protecting our children is probably the most important government interest we have
7765355 one of our policy concerns is that the ordinances tend to draw in a lot of people who are actually not a danger to children
7765356 everybody who is labeled a sex offender is not the habitual pedophile who is going to grab a kid off a swing
7765357 it was easy to take the name for our shop from my parents however we wanted to prove ourselves and open our own bakery just for us isabelle and vincent
7765358 people need to have a challenge and go with their dream
7765359 this is the first formal education theyve ever had regardless of language
7765360 with the aging process comes that situation where their retention is harder
7765361 i hear all the time well teacher it went in one ear and came out the other thats the memory part thats the aging part so we drill and drill and drill ill repeat it 100 times if i need to
7765362 but theres a lot riding on it think about it your very livelihood could depend on passing that test
7765363 especially the elderly they have faithfully worked hard at jobs their whole lives they have faithfully waited and studied for the citizenship test and they are all faithful christians that is faithful citizenship
7765364 the bottom line is the opportunity to increase the tax base and expand the footprint of downtown
7765365 we need downtown to be more than elm street that was the goal
7765366 we propose an investment strategy that does for church street what has been done so successfully for elm
7765367 the aim should be that in five to 10 years the name church street should be synonymous with arts culture and entertainment
7765368 assuming church street could achieve the status of elm there is opportunity for 10 13 million in additional property taxes along church street over the next 30 years
7765369 real but disconnected with no critical mass in any one location
7765370 it is critical that the civil rights museum downtowns most important new cultural asset be completed
7765371 making public funds available to accomplish this merits very serious consideration
7765372 were not preparing our kids just to be screwing in widgets
7765373 theyll have to fight and navigate through a lot of change theyll have to manage their retirement their health care and think through how to retrain themselves over and over again
7765374 well like all of those games were played with leather helmets on who cares about that long ago

7765383 he who believes in the son has eternal life but he who does not obey the son shall not se life but the wrath of god abides on him
7765384 it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of god
7765385 because of the aforesaid things the wrath of god is coming upon the sons of disobedience
7765386 jehovah went passing by before moses face and declaring jehovah jehovah a god merciful and gracious slow to anger and abundant in loving kindness
7765387 in order that he might make known the riches of his glory upon vessels of mercy
7765388 education is an admirable thing but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth learning can be taught
7765389 why doesnt education focus on what humans can do better than the machines and instruments they create
7765390 the ideal school environment for young people to become educated in should have the following characteristics learning takes place through self motivation and self regulations the output of learners is judged through self evaluation a concept that includes the freedom learning groups form based on common interests no artificial distinction is drawn between learners and teachers all members of the learning community participate fully in regulating its activities such a school is permeated with an atmosphere of comfort self confidence and bustle given the freedom to fail without censure students will often challenge themselves to work hardest on their weaknesses
7765391 dat is nu eens en goed bericht en een voorbeeld van good practice ik

7765394 ho un vip pass per electronic arts vai a vedere rock band 2
7765395 for the first time i am proud of my country
7765396 barack hat mich nicht ein einziges mal in unserer 20 j hrigen beziehung entt uscht
7765397 i will say it like i said it in raleigh or i wont say it at all
7765398 im not alone in this situation we cant keep going the way were going
7765399 her story really does in many ways reflect the problem a lot of north carolinians have faced over the last eight years
7765400 im trying to get my nerves calmed down now that im here
7765401 theyre just not what youre used to in your personal vehicle
7765402 the best thing for us is its a newer suspension and a drivetrain
7765403 and it will be driveable the old one is more difficult to drive and is constantly hitting things
7765404 theres no easy way but you have to talk about it
7765405 its natural for kids to think can this happen to me we need to let them know this was a freak thing and while we can pray and keep that family in our thoughts its my job to move us forward
7765406 im going to talk to them but what im going to say i havent a clue
7765407 i dont want to make our kids apprehensive but i also know its on their minds how could it not
7765408 as a parent as a football player its always in the back of your mind
7765409 but this could have easily happened in any sport look at soccer they hit headers and collide into each other without helmets basketball you can easily catch an elbow and ive seen baseball players hit in the head by fastballs theres a risk in all sports just as in life
7765410 my guess is the damage was irreversible within minutes after he went down
7765411 there was really nothing anybody could do the hospitals the paramedics the trainers it was just one of those rare things that happens in sports sometimes
7765412 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
7765413 i can tell you ill be comfortable with whoever that is
7765414 were just glad to have all the kids back and were just excited about another successful school year here in rockingham county
7765415 they tend to do better when they take responsibility for themselves
7765416 the whole steve being out the first couple of games and with our numbers being depleted its a good thing that our running backs are running as well as they are right now
7765417 im disappointed for our football team but im also disappointed for him
7765418 hes a guy who was on our practice squad most of last year he made it onto the active roster and worked his tail off all offseason and was really having a good camp and had a real strong possibility of making our football team
7765419 therell be a lot of guys that we can look at and well just see what our potential is on our football team and obviously the other people out there
7765420 we are happy that brandon has decided to join our program
7765421 we feel brandon can make a solid contribution to our squad
7765422 pops jump in the youth told his dad one day
7765423 weve got to clean this up before you mom gets home dad told son
7765424 my mom did find out about that joey logano said
7765425 then the ice cream man would come and id get ice cream logano said with a toothy smile
7765426 i know this is crazy but i dont think theres any reason we cant go out and put ourselves in position to try to win a couple of races next year said greg zipadelli who will be loganos crew chief next season
7765427 id be very disappointed if we didnt have a couple of opportunities to win
7765428 it sounds like a good plan to me so well stick to that
7765429 its kind of cool to see a ranking like that
7765430 it shows what our coaches have done two years ago we werent winning more than four games a season and now were competing for championships its a neat thing going on here were all pumped about it
7765431 when i first arrived we really didnt know if we could win
7765432 we would go into some games doubting this season we have no doubts we feel like we can step on the field and play with anybody
7765433 its about time we find out how much weve grown up since last year and try to play at the level that people are giving us credit for its exciting to be in that position
7765434 last year we knew we had talent but going into the season we didnt know what we could do with it
7765435 this year we know what we can do we do have a lot of talent on the field and the expectations have gone up thats pretty important around here for everybody
7765436 part of our goal is to put less pressure on riddle and spread the onus around the offense including the offensive line
7765437 im not too big on making a lot of catches
7765438 as long as we can win and get a conference championship a national championship ill be satisfied
7765439 it puts a lot of pressure on your defense it doesnt give you time to decipher down distance and formation all the things you use for advantages get taken away when people are constantly attacking you
7765440 this discovery may eventually lead to enhanced understanding of psychiatric diseases such as schizophrenia obsessive compulsive disorder and attention deficit disorder all conditions in which a persons ability to remember and change such rules is impaired
7765441 this indicates that different parts of our brains store different kinds of memories and information
7765442 provides clues about how the human brain accomplishes complex goal directed behaviors that require remembering and changing abstract rules an ability that is disrupted in many mental illnesses
7765443 from societys perspective covering the uninsured is still a good investment failure to act in the near term will only make it more expensive to cover the uninsured in the future while adding to the amount of lost productivity from not insuring all americans

7765451 some players showed some serious fire i watched each line going through drills and there was absolutely no screwing around i personally really like this coaching staff ed donatell is first class steve gervais is a total stud i really hope it stays intact from the head coach on down
7765452 i wanted to see ty extended contractually i think things are on the right track
7765453 its hard to defend him from all the stories and detractors there are a lot of similar stories about how alumni and fans have been treated
7765454 my dad is 61 theyre banning 61 year old men from practice based upon a message board post it seems way over the top i dont think oregon is looking to a message board to find a way to beat washington
7765455 a school spokesman however said it was not expected that shaw would return anytime soon and could miss the season
7765456 obviously losing to oregon isnt much of a washington tradition that is accepted around here
7765457 hopefully this year that changes weve worked too hard come too far to go down there and not be able to give those guys a great fight and hopefully come out on top they are a good football team but so are we
7765458 its hard oregon is a rivalry just like washington state if not more than washington state and its hard it hurts not even beating oregon once so on the 30th we are going to go out there and just scratch and do everything we can do to beat oregon
7765459 everybody would rather see us beat oregon as opposed to washington state
7765460 granted its great to beat both of them but it seems like the rivalry between washington and oregon over the years has turned into a hate fest and thats what makes the game so exciting
7765461 they went to oregon we came to washington they wish they could have come to washington
7765462 they are a good team and all but that is a rivalry even the freshmen know no one likes oregon nobody so i have all the confidence in the world no matter whats said all the hype that we are going to going to go in there and do what we have to do
7765463 its still kind of a day to day thing and well see how it feels on saturday

7765466 internet explorer takes their usual route and ignores the required comma separated values and only supports the optional comma less method so even though using commas is the correct method youll need to drop the commas in order for the clip property to work in internet explorer even in ie7
7765467 the w3c recommendation suggests using commas between the coordinates however this is broken in internet explorer strangely using the commas in ie does not work when in standards compliant mode but it does work when in quirks mode
7765468 the top margin of an in flow block level element is adjoining to its first in flow block level childs top margin if the element has no top border no top padding and the child has no clearance
7765469 the bottom margin of an in flow block level element with a height of auto and min height less than the elements used height and max height greater than the elements used height is adjoining to its last in flow block level childs bottom margin if the element has no bottom padding or no bottom border
7765470 essentially ie treats them horizontal lines as inline elements while the others browsers treats them horizontal lines as block elements
7765471 i just encountered a dom implementation issue in ie which took about three hours to solve and like a year off my life
7765472 the link element references alternative style sheets that the reader can select
7765473 5 if the source document comes with alternate style sheet sets such as with the alternate keyword in html 4 then the ua must allow the user to select which style sheet set the ua should apply
7765474 user agents should give users the opportunity to select from among alternate style sheets or to switch off style sheets altogether
7765475 authors may specify a number of mutually exclusive style sheets called alternate style sheets users may select their favorite among these depending on their preferences user agents should provide a means for users to view and pick from the list of alternate styles
7765476 allow the user to choose from and apply alternative author style sheets such as linked style sheets
7765477 other bugs that we fixed nested block elements now respect all overflow declarations hidden scroll etc
7765478 the top margin of an in flow block level element is adjoining to its first in flow block level childs top margin if the element has no top border no top padding and the child has no clearance

7765480 simply put ie for windows relative font size inheritance cascade is broken if you find it necessary to size through cascade youll find works more reliably than ems
7765481 the next incarnation of the internet explorer bug database what makes you think that there is ever going to be a next incarnation it has been temporarily offline for more than a year it isnt coming back i have a solution openness the ie team can start actually communicating with people especially developers about the content of ie8 the roadmap of ies future both with ie8 but also beyond that and how they are going to address the issues that web developers still have with them they can recreate or create a bug database in which developers can log ie issues and they can actually do something with the issues logged so that people can see progress how about sitting down with the makers of the other browsers like opera apple mozilla not to mention others to discuss how they can work together for the common good of the web there needs to be a way for developers to log real issues which the ie team then triages and potentially responds to at all times not just during a beta if they have a temporary bug database and then turn it off i will understand why they do so but that doesnt really solve the problem of how do you report a serious bug or issue to the ie team and if you do report an issue how do you know if it will ever be addressed these are real issues to people
7765482 to create the icon use an icon editor such as the one included in microsoft visual studio and save the icon in the ico file format internet explorer will ignore icons that are not in ico format and will instead display the default internet explorer shortcut icon
7765483 do you want the bad news first or the terrible news
7765484 well if those are my choices i guess ill take the bad news first
7765485 your wife found a picture worth a half million dollars
7765486 if you call that bad i cant wait to hear the terrible news
7765487 well ill tell you what happened i had just loaded my favorite mule bessie into the
7765488 i asked you about your statement to the sheriffs deputy did you not say at the scene of the accident im fine
7765489 like i was saying i loaded bessie into the trailer and i hitched it to my pick up truck
7765490 your honor i am trying to establish the fact that at the scene of the accident this man told the sheriffs deputy on the scene that he was just fine now many months after the accident he is trying to sue my client if his case is not a fraud he should be able to answer my question with a simple yes or no please tell him to simply answer the question
7765491 lets hear what he has to say if he doesnt get around to answering your question well deal with it after we find out about bessie
7765492 father father the smith case that you always said would go on forever the one you have been toiling on for ten years in one single day i settled that case and saved the client a fortune
7765493 well it caught fire and i retired here with the fire insurance proceeds what are you doing here
7765494 remember that real estate i had in mississippi well the river overflowed and here i am with the flood insurance proceeds its amazing that we both ended up here in pretty much the same way
7765495 heres 30 000 cash to be held by each of you i trust you to put this in my coffin when i die so i can take all my money with me
7765496 i only put 20 000 into the envelope because i needed 10 000 to repair the roof of the church
7765497 i only put 10 000 in the envelope because we needed a new x ray machine for the pediatrics ward at the hospital which cost 20 000
7765498 you are under arrest i get a reward for you dead or alive tell me where the money is and ill let you live if you dont ill shoot you right here and save myself the trouble of having to take you back to texas alive
7765499 tell him that if he doesnt tell me where the loot is ill shoot him here and now
7765500 ill be voting for my brother or ill be kicked out of the family by my mother
7765501 just as the big boost to infrastructure ive announced today reflects last years strong economic performance the economic challenges were facing this year mean i can safely predict i wont make this kind of announcement 12 months from now
7765502 ontarians deserve to know where all federal parties stand on fairness for ontario
7765503 if it were possible to wave a magic wand and to have family doctors materialize here in ontario we would do so but we cant
7765504 theres no easy magic solution to be found when it comes to addressing all of the challenges faced in our emergency rooms
7765505 i just dont think we should allow our minds to become gripped by crime and to become prisoners in our own community
7765506 ongoing provincial municipal partnerships with toronto and ontarios other cities towns and regions are essential
7765507 this government understands that only when ontarios municipalities succeed can the province succeed
7765508 jesus christ people lets try to keep a secret for more than 20 minutes mkay
7765509 ive had style statement for over five months now and even though ive filled out all the questions i cant help but return to it again and again to be inspired
7765510 it opened up a door to such a beautiful conversation between a mother and son i dont think we ever would have had that unforgettable moment if not for randy pausch
7765511 i read this in 1996 when spending long hours supervising some rough and tumble guys on a huge project building wilderness hiking trails and a provincial park this book was key to my survival kit
7765512 this book made me think about how my lifestyle choices can impact the environment and other people
7765513 understanding your enneagram type names your dark side and where to go for specific spiritual personal growth
7765514 requires you to take a good hard look at what you believe what you think and whether or not you are taking responsibility or blaming others for the life you live
7765515 were all busy professionals who dont socialize enough so bring something to eat next friday at my place and lets see what happens
7765516 it is one of two chances if we are honest
7765517 we can win the fa cup and we can win the carling cup
7765518 this is a lesson to us ministers that we must always look after the poor and unfortunate in the society
7765519 it was a tough competition but navuloa stood above the rest and was declared the winner
7765520 what does a year feel like how long a time is it how many times did you do training do you remember the training when was the last time you went for a run what month did you like training best in when did you used to run 10ks how long ago was it you did a 10k in a wheelchair
7765521 i am going away and i will be back in two weeks
7765522 we will have to wait two weeks because the bill for the oxygen came
7765523 we are poor we are going to be poor forever because of you
7765524 i said that x time weeks months ago that isnt a problem anymore
7765525 no longer than that next week longer than now longer than soon
7765526 longs a big guy it would have been a lot tougher
7765527 weve got to make somebody else beat us besides locker i dont have much more to say other than we must stop locker
7765528 there were smiles here and there like were ready for you
7765529 he has an ability to read body language and be in the right place
7765530 mays can do some things that maybe pat cant but pat i think can do some things taylor mays cant when it comes to covering space
7765531 with his athleticism character toughness hes as good a safety as there is on the west coast
7765532 i think we can be the best in the nation
7765533 its well known that when you drink you get a buzz but a couple of hours later that initial impact at least is gone
7765534 there is always a very delicate balance between newly formed cells and dying cells
7765535 its a very active period of that balance because usually you develop a surplus of tissue then later melt it back down to acquire a specific shape
7765536 the digits form because the inter digital tissue dies if it did not die we would have paddles instead of hands with fingers
7765537 you have to make people aware of the science behind the risk
7765538 we are not saying that every pregnant woman who drinks three or four glasses of wine in a short period will have a baby with birth defects but it elevates the risk
7765539 if there is an opportunity here we have to look at it
7765540 we are saying this is the one place they should leave alone
7765541 it is an incredibly diverse and productive place we have fish and shellfish spawning 12 months a year there is nothing else like it
7765542 given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke of burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications
7765543 besides initiatives to reduce incense smoke exposure future studies should be undertaken to identify the least harmful types of incense
7765544 certain reproductive factors may have a greater impact on risk of certain molecular subtypes of disease compared to others
7765545 i never felt scared not even for a moment i took just 10 minutes to settle down
7765546 if daw aung san suu kyi continues to refuse food from her comrades her health will be of serious concern
7765547 today on wolf blitzers show beck reiterated his dissatisfaction with john mccain repeating his mantra
7765548 shane on first 10 foot lead posada knows shane hook slides so hes gonna throw to the inside part of the base
7765549 shane goes posada throws umpire calls him out bang here come 12 different replays and they all show shanes hook slide avoided the tag they dont reverse the call yankees win the game
7765550 they say it will slow down the games it takes 2 seconds to re rack the tape you know what slows down games lou piniella going out there to argue for 4 minutes kicking dirt
7765551 and van brocklin would throw it and mcdonald wasnt there and van brocklin would get really hissed
7765552 mcdonald had tripped i could see that on my monitors in the truck but the fan watching at home didnt know that i wanted the fan to see what i saw
7765553 took it back to new york somebody erased it or taped over it which is what happened to the first super bowl which i directed
7765554 no royalties because i was an employee at cbs and no emmy i dont know why maybe it was an anti italian backlash
7765555 called the truck and said my boy what you have done here will have such far reaching implications we cant begin to imagine them today
7765556 he had to do everything had to shoot the biggest water buffalo but he couldnt have invented instant replay because he was never in the truck he never directed he never punched the buttons
7765557 tony verna son of italian immigrants invented the instant replay
7765558 because it changed something that had never been done before
7765559 maybe the only way in american politics today to bring people together
7765560 theres some of that but probably theres more gratitude for the honor of speaking
7765561 lets be candid were not at the point our party could nominate someone who is pro life maybe even for v p
7765562 and i think theres excitement about sen caseys win in 06 when we took down rick santorum a great effort that included pro choice democrats
7765563 bobby casey has not made it quite as much of his political being the way his dad did
7765564 missed an opportunity to listen to a guy who understood how people struggle
7765565 were going to stay here for just a couple of minutes to state our disgust with this abomination the way the city and secret service are tearing the constitution of the united states to shreds and then we will leave
7765566 i refuse to be emotionally blackmailed to vote for a candidate
7765567 a tall blond producer was waving her arms trying to get more passion
7765568 it just always inspired me that a person at that level would make time for me
7765569 she talked the soccer mom talk but didnt look the soccer mom part
7765570 but do you think she looks like a soccer mom
7765571 nothing says it more than when she brought those girls out
7765572 as the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new obama biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone democrats believe a mccain romney ticket would provide a near perfect frame for their class conscious message
7765573 it will be a contest theyll say between the son of a single mother and son of a car salesman against the son of an admiral and son of a governor
7765574 and even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why obama didnt just go through the motions of vetting clinton for the vice presidency tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process it wouldnt have been true and clinton probably would have known it wasnt true but what could she have done as it turned out since obama blew her off she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this
7765575 the fourth defensive tackle is a guy by the name of klecko
7765576 he looks good to me right now he had a good game the other night and hes had a great camp
7765577 ive been hearing that hes a long shot since ive been in the nfl
7765578 they said i was too small to be a nose tackle up in new england
7765579 i just put it out of my mind and go play
7765580 he has good football sense and he loves to play hes a high motor guy im not going to say he hasnt surprised me some im not quite as surprised after being around him a bit
7765581 honestly if you guys had not just told me id have no idea what was said
7765582 ive got to get through this week and then hopefully when the roster for st louis the season opener comes youre name is still there im just going to keep doing what i did to get here keep pushing
7765583 to tell truth id only lost about 10 pounds to go down to fullback
7765584 putting the weight back on wasnt the problem it was eating all that chicken and salad to get it off in the first place
7765585 switching back to tackle was easy you just go back to what you know the only thing was you had to get back in that pass rushing and run stuffing mind set it wasnt a big deal
7765586 i had to learn the whole front seven in new england
7765587 it was just as complicated up there dont get me wrong because im still learning but i think its going ok
7765588 starting today all of my thoughts will be reserved for a new medium something smaller something more intimate and something very personal an email list
7765589 why bother blogging if email list is a better option for making money online
7765590 my whole thing is that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so expletive smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what expletive dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
7765591 a real political scrapper who knows how to throw a punch
7765592 your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk about how to pay the bills thats not a worry john mccain has hell have to figure out which of the seven tables to sit at
7765593 one in four arizonans has never voted in an election with mccain on the ballot
7765594 ladies and gentlemen the coverage of barack obama was embarrassing it was embarrassing
7765595 japanese soldiers in the south pacific still fighting after the war is over
7765596 the most qualified candidate to lead our country as commander in chief
7765597 he has to keep smiling because no one wants an angry african american in the white house
7765598 kind of sensed the sort of hopeless dead feeling in me and came over and stood beside me for awhile
7765599 he didnt say a word but he looked over at the chaps who were yelling at me through him and just stared he was standing by me i could tell you that
7765600 to have that kind of exposure people talking about ucla football in anticipation of this game is terrific
7765601 i dont like to talk in those terms because i prefer to look at it as if its going to go well
7765602 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in
7765603 our quarterbacks i have great confidence in all three of them to be honest with you and i cant tell you today wholl take the field first
7765604 i can tell you ill be comfortable with whoever that is
7765605 we have received reports from our tactical operations group in davao that they have found debris near one village
7765606 we are praying hard they are safe alive that is our serious hope
7765607 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads
7765608 hes not anti black absolutely not hes not in any way shape or form a racist
7765609 brett carroll was a hard working decent australian he lost his life in a workplace accident that should never have happened
7765610 sit around and do nothing during breaks because they dont like other sports
7765611 reviewing the decision and the minister has given his support for that
7765612 obviously theres been quite a bit of community backlash against the decision so the minister just asked for them to have another look and see if thats what they really want to do the spokeswoman said
7765613 leaders of the region have arrived at the scene and they are handling the accident
7765614 any information related to the accident will be released by the guangxi government
7765615 you cant short circuit the process of holding folk accountable just because you fall in love
7765616 is a personal friend of mind im excited as a black man about this moment
7765617 the closer you get to power the more truth gets sacrificed
7765618 i recognize that barack obama is not trying to be a black president but there ought to be an urban agenda
7765619 after the 21st after his inauguration youre still going to lose your house
7765620 i understand the love that black people have for obama i get that
7765621 i think the way you make the president a good president is when you make them acountable
7765622 the rock you grew up with from the 70s 80s and 90s
7765623 comprendemos y nos asombra lo milagrosa que es la vida porque los seres humanos somos como centauros hechos de la misma materia que la yerba y al tiempo androides rebeldes que nos hemos creado a nosotros mismos nuestra rebeli n comienza en nuestra conciencia que nos separa de todo lo dem s nos hace ver el mundo desde fuera y nos hace escrutarlo y analizarlo en una actividad incesante que puede conducirnos al paroxismo y a la desesperaci n s lo nos rescata del extrav o una parte de esa misma conciencia nuestra la que nos recuerda que estamos hechos de lo mismo que el caballo y que al cabo nuestra carne nuestro carbono le pertenece a todo lo dem s que nos aguarda de vuelta esa parte de la mente nos hace sentirnos relegados nos hace religiosos de un modo u otro

7765625 pero cuando la muerte se da al mismo tiempo en un mismo lugar y en gran n mero de casos se alcanza la masa cr tica necesaria para que explote para nosotros la cat strofe
7765626 al establecer la muerte como medida de la vida y dar as valor a la vida establecemos la base para una moral la que tenemos de ah se deriva que quien cause da o o mate deba sentir turbaci n y verg enza y de ah derivamos tambi n que los comportamientos en sociedad de los due os de los recursos econ micos de las empresas deban actuar dentro de unos l mites en que no perjudiquen ni pongan en peligro la vida de los ciudadanos pol tica y econom a deben atenerse a l mites morales cuando entramos en una crisis que amenaza recortes sociales y optimizaci n de beneficios a trav s de la precarizaci n del trabajo y el recorte de calidad de mercanc as y servicios debemos recordarlo porque las personas compartimos sustancia con el caballo y la yerba y nuestra vida tiene un final pero no somos mercanc as con fecha de caducidad estampada

7765634 im thoroughly disgusted with the democratic party i believe the real magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight
7765635 despite all the talk that we hear from the democratic party here in colorado about unity the democratic party is in fact divided
7765636 i believe the real magic of barack obama was his ability to turn lifelong democrats like us into mccain supporters overnight

7765685 lo dif cil en la primera ronda no es ganar sino jugar bien
7765686 siempre hablamos de la dificultad de las primeras rondas pero al final casi nunca se pierde para m lo realmente dif cil es jugar bien estos partidos porque aunque vengas con confianza cuando llegas a un torneo nuevo necesitas un periodo de adaptaci n porque las condiciones son distintas

7765695 this is the most luminous and therefore probably the most massive cluster of galaxies discovered at this epoch
7765696 the light we observe started about 7 7 billion years ago this is about half of the age of the universe so it is from quite long ago and quite far away
7765697 the very presence of this cluster confirms the existence of a mysterious component of the universe called dark energy
7765698 such massive galaxy clusters are thought to be rare objects in the distant universe they can be used to test cosmological theories
7765699 the existence of the cluster can only be explained with dark energy
7765700 we have wondered why the milky ways black hole appears to be a slumbering giant
7765701 but now we realize that the black hole was far more active in the past perhaps its just resting after a major outburst
7765702 by observing how this cloud lit up and faded over 10 years we could trace back the black holes activity 300 years ago
7765703 the black hole was a million times brighter three centuries ago it must have unleashed an incredibly powerful flare
7765704 this is the fastest temperature change in the instrumental record and it puts us back to where we were in 1930
7765705 if the temperature does not soon recover we will have to conclude that global warming is over
7765706 my guess is that the odds are now at least 50 50 that we will see significant cooling rather than warming in coming decades
7765707 there is absolutely no doubt that the world is in a warming phase
7765708 and that conclusion is supported by 99 of all serious scientists so im certainly not alone in that certainty

7765736 the new per query evaluation of quality score affects you in that keywords will no longer appear as inactive for search in your account instead all keywords will have the chance to show ads on google web search and the search network unless youve paused or deleted them keep in mind however that keywords previously marked inactive for search are not likely to accrue a great deal of traffic following this change this is because their combined per query quality score and bid probably isnt high enough to gain competitive placement
7765737 as a result of migrating to per query quality score we are no longer showing minimum bids in your account instead were replacing minimum bids with a new more meaningful metric first page bids first page bids are an estimate of the bid it would take for your ad to reach the first page of search results on google web search theyre based on the exact match version of the keyword the ads quality score and current advertiser competition on that keyword based on your feedback we learned that knowing your minimum bid wasnt always helpful in getting the ad placement you wanted so we hope that first page bids will give you better guidance on how to achieve your advertising goals
7765738 its worth mentioning that the impact of these changes will vary from advertiser to advertiser some might see no changes to their ad serving while others may see a noticeable difference as always we recommend optimizing ads to prevent them from receiving a low quality score

7765783 as the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new obama biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone democrats believe a mccain romney ticket would provide a near perfect frame for their class conscious message
7765784 it will be a contest theyll say between the son of a single mother and son of a car salesman against the son of an admiral and son of a governor
7765785 and even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why obama didnt just go through the motions of vetting clinton for the vice presidency tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process it wouldnt have been true and clinton probably would have known it wasnt true but what could she have done as it turned out since obama blew her off she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this

7765794 he had to do everything had to shoot the biggest water buffalo but he couldnt have invented instant replay because he was never in the truck he never directed he never punched the buttons

7765809 i checked the carcass and found the cow had died naturally
7765810 tests had shown the hair samples and tracks couldnt be matched with any known animal
7765811 but four features all the reports shared were the dark hair the domed head the large footprints and the glowing red eyes
7765812 natures my home how could some missing link be wandering around up here without me knowing it
7765813 but scientists challenged my film it had stood up under every conceivable test
7765814 but my documented evidence wasnt good enough for the experts experts who still ask how could such a creature survive where does it live show us its remains what does it eat experts who challenged my word but claimed credit for my film and profited by it on lecture circuits well i didnt care for these people
7765815 if bigfoot were a migratory animal my theory had to hold up all along the way
7765816 this same will to survive must have somehow kept bigfoot going throughout all these years
7765817 sure enough an old miners story told how the glaciers up there were the burial grounds of the bigfoot that would explain why there were no remains the creatures carried their dead over thousands of miles just to deposit them in crevices that opened up in the spring thaw
7765818 the fisherman said bigfoot smiles upon you ivan marx you will bring word of him to the people below

7765836 ive been hearing that hes a long shot since ive been in the nfl
7765837 they said i was too small to be a nose tackle up in new england

7765842 to tell truth id only lost about 10 pounds to go down to fullback
7765843 putting the weight back on wasnt the problem it was eating all that chicken and salad to get it off in the first place
7765844 switching back to tackle was easy you just go back to what you know the only thing was you had to get back in that pass rushing and run stuffing mind set it wasnt a big deal
7765845 i had to learn the whole front seven in new england
7765846 it was just as complicated up there dont get me wrong because im still learning but i think its going ok

7765986 and love true love unconditional love cannot be grasped as yet on your planet by most of you it can be imagined but not truly acquired because the third dimension the dimension ninety percent of humankind exist within is a conditional dimension
7765987 excerpted from the earth keeper chronicles june 2008 archangel metatron via james tyberonn sexuality is another area that is very complex very confusing for many of you throughout the eons of time there have been many systems of belief many varied expressions experiments and modalities within the various cultures across the planet on sexual expression within biology some were very inhibited others extremely liberal most human in your present society have conflictory issues about their sexuality and sexual expression it is not ironic that many of you will achieve the highest balance in your lives only after your body ceases to produce sexual hormones yet the release of kundalini of chi through the sexual act is among the most powerful energies available to mankind it has been used for good and has fallen into wasteful misappropriation the key is intent when there is consensual attraction teamed with caring and mutual respect it can be exquisitly sensual beautiful and sacred it is capable of transporting the spirit to higher realms combinining the trinity of body mind and soul when this occurs particularly among members of the same soul guild there is an energy imprint imparted and a synergistic effect that is beneficial on many levels sexuality is the natural expression of love that flowers between souls it can be the highest natural expression of love between people regardless of gender yet it can become a source of guilt a source of control and a source of bias and judgement it can become a source of self aggrandizement and addiction particularly among those of the male gender it is often misunderstood and often misused relationships should be based on agreement and the freedom of this expression should be honored yet optimally aligned with the higher chakras high intent within sexuality is extremely beneficial on all levels physical mental and spiritual it can be a source of rejuvenation and regeneration yet some choose sexual expressions that border on debauchery manipulation greed conquest and misaligned addiction to physical orgasm without judgement we tell you that sexual energy is a gift of exquisite energy and when used in higher intent offers a glimpse into the sacred orgasmic bliss of the celestial realms it is life force and should be used wisely encompassing the body mind and spirit its responsible enfoldment with high intent sharing and love dear ones is another aspect of impeccability oh you say this is so complex of course it is but it is why you are here masters and you can do this with self review and strength of will we are not asking something of you that is beyond your ability we are not asking you to do something that you have no innate understanding of indeed you know these truths already we are revealing what your ego has attempted to hide so what is this we are revealing it is no mystery dear ones it is the crystalline frequency it is the resonance of impeccability it is the mental crystalline resonance and it takes effort it takes will it takes work it takes time and it requires humility masters you are on the cusp of something extraordinary seize the day do not waste precious time do not waste another lifetime you are so close to acquiring a dream that you have sought for many many lifetimes everything you have hidden away everything you have ignored every little obstacle you have put on the back burner will come forward and give you opportunity after opportunity to resolve it it wont go away all unresolved energy must be transmuted before you can step into impeccability and until it is faced it will surface again time after time after time until you confront and dissolve it unresolved energy is that which you have left in chaos in your life and some of you on the cusp of mastery have reorganized these little bits of chaos and repackaged them into tidy little boxes that you have justified in one fashion or another you have justified them disguised them hidden them and spun them into unrecognizable forms that allow you self exoneration thats called denial its called postponement and you put it away to deal with in another lifetime thats called wasting time wasting opportunity the unresolved energy you repel has been polarized and it sits outside your mental field disowned disavowed denied ticking away so you work at maintaining the status quo charging forward some of you on the threshold of mastery think you can move forward irregardless and this dear ones is not the case you may feel saintly because of the many gains you have made and the many issues you have resolved but in most cases the things you have resolved were resolved because they were comparatively easier to handle the ones that were really hard really hidden you havent dealt with you see masters the closer you get to light the stronger you attract the dark it is in a real sense physics electromagnetics pure positive energy has the greatest attraction to negative energy so you must have the wisdom the humility the strength and discipline to deflect it there is another law of physics that you must understand and that is when you achieve the crystalline vibration called impeccability you rise above magnetic duality attraction and enter a field called zero point that is blissful detachment now hard energy hatred and anger is another piece of the puzzle how do you deal with this this isnt a great mystery to you in fact you created it its a part of duality it has two aspects your bible talks of turning the other cheek what does that mean this doesnt mean you apologize when someone steps on your foot part of the paradox is indeed standing up for your truth but it does mean you dont step on the feet of others intentionally or otherwise do you understand aggression is feared by many of you yet in its core aggression is one of the most creative forces on the planet the force that enables a small seed to burst force through the soil and raise its tender green shoot toward the sun and burst into a beautiful flower is pure aggression when human conflict occurs aggression in its pure form is often the means in which humans learn more about themselves we are not referring to a war but rather both parties standing in their truths and finding the means to fully express their views conflicts are often contractual set ups opportunities that teach both parties each of you have an opportunity to stand in impeccability within any conflict you can deal with conflict without engaging it do you understand deal with face it from a stance of emotional detachment as the observer and that is not easy yet it is the way of the master each of you have an opportunity to be impeccable every day the scenario in which you recognize your own failings your own conflict with integrity is the day you encompass impeccability and indeed it is a journey likewise the day you stand in your truth with willingness to recognize another persons truth you encompass integrity there is a saying that the right for a man to swing his fist ends where another mans nose begins impeccability involves recognizing the rights of others without surrendering your own be good to one another measure twice and cut once when you make a mistake own it forgive and be forgiven and do so within detachment there is often the feeling that comes when facing the conflicts and difficulties of life that it is too hard many feel at times that it is just too difficult but masters it is never too hard it is never too difficult the moment you accept your challenges and rise to them in detachment is the moment you achieve clarity of purpose and integrity of clear mind this knowledge this moment of clarity then becomes the power driver of your life irregularity is removed within this detached state of crystalline lucidity you are able and only then able to access the divine mind the multidimensional brain the extraordinary state of clarity that has always been there but never quite accessed in emotional attached states of thinking it is the divine mind the super subconscious that contains within it the aspect of man that is divine the god mind it is achieved through impeccability of clear thinking of lucid mind within the extraordinary crystalline field at this point the human is in a crystalline geometric field of the merkivah the human has become a divine thinking soul and crossed the veil into the creative divine mind the divine mind is only achieved only accessed through crystalline resonance within crystalline thought waves crystalline thought is above emotion above petty feelings it is achieved in detachment it is the crystalline lake of shamballa of nirvana as smooth as glass no waves distorting its mirrored visage masters when you achieve this clarity this level of unbiased focus you have a direct alignment to the extraordinary divine field within you this field is crystal it is unclouded unwaved with doubt unfettered by fear victimization or any of the petty issues that clutter the day to day thought patterns of the limited ego mind this field of crystalline thought divine mind is devoid of the turbulent tempestuous raging of victimization judgement lust for power control anger and passionate involvement that is so often inpatterned in the repeating dialogue of the inner narrator of the ego mind it is detached from and above the storm of emotion it is bliss it is achieved in impeccability this state of beingness is the level in which we achieve the creative divinity of life this state of being is capable of manifesting all that we desire within wisdom and love the frequency of love clarity as the requisite for the crystalline creative state everything that you have read and been taught about how to achieve impeccability and how to manifest joy health and abundance in your life can only be achieved in the detached state of the crystalline mind we say again and again it does not occur in the attached state of the ego mind and it never will all you have read and learned about creating your world and manifesting your reality is merely an unachieved potential and an intriguing philosophy until you experience it directly until you do it you cannot and you will not become a true masterful divine being until you decide to become impeccable until you decide to make the effort to review your life and remove the hindrances until you love the self and then and only then can you truly love others in unconditional higher dimensional love within the crystalline field seize the day if you are hurting others if you are caught in ego in victimization control of others depression a lust for power stop it change now until you do you are doomed to repeat the cycle there is a divine intelligence a lucid clarity that takes you to the mastery you seek that is available and many of you are so close to achieving it dont stop clear the closet the lucid mind the crystalline field is achieved when the inner narrator is stopped and the frontal mind lets go of issues seek the light be honest review your life and calibrate put your best effort into everything you do encompass and live your beliefs remove fear and doubt remove anger and control love yourself love all life nurture others be detached create your world there is no ecstasy more supreme than achieving the divine mind it is why you are here sooner or later you will learn this and the sooner you do the sooner you will find within yourself that elusive doorway into the realm of creatorship of mastery it has always been there and it awaits you dear ones i am metatron and you are beloved

7766008 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7766009 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing

7766026 truck shows are an important channel by which tics members can market their products and inform those involved in the industry and the public of the significant technological advances that are being made by truck manufacturers and major component suppliers
7766027 its the tics view that a major truck show every second year is probably the right approach
7766028 firstly it is an opportunity for tic to market its core message that todays trucks are safer greener and essential for the freight task that the nation faces
7766029 from a truck manufacturers perspective this requirement may not necessarily coincide with holding a national truck show every two years as an example in 2011 members of tic will obviously wish to display their latest products which will be introduced in line with the new adr 80 03 emission standard which comes into force from january 2011

7766087 people are starting to think differently about textiles and more are buying or using linen in the way europeans did in the 19th century
7766088 unlike cotton good linen is expensive but grows more beautiful with time and washing
7766089 before i loved the feel of french linen but now ive come to recommend the japan made product
7766090 it makes sense to support the domestic textile industry not just for cost purposes but simply because new companies in that field are doing great work
7766091 hardly anyone knows about them because they operate on such a small basis and rarely bother to advertise
7766092 theres an unmistakable air of authenticity and romance in everything they make you can tell that they understand and love linen how romantic and evocative it is
7766093 whether the material is natural and how it feels on the skin where it was made whether the process damaged the environment unnecessarily
7766094 people are much more attuned to that sort of information
7766095 right now no fashion trend could emerge or last very long without giving a big bow to the environment because the consumer is so much more concerned about such things than they were 10 years ago now whatever is wasteful excessive or selfish just wont cut it anymore no matter how snazzy the design

7766098 i am the vine you are the branches those who abide in me and i in them bear much fruit because apart from me you can do nothing
7766099 the image is a simple one and easy to understand a grapevine is not an ornamental plant its sole purpose is to produce grapes the grapes are found on the branches of the vine not on the vine stock itself the vine stock is rooted in the ground and is tended and cared for by the vinegrower the vine stock provides the branches with everything they need to produce grapes nourishment energy and life unity connectedness between the vine and the branches is essential if a branch is separated or cut off from the vine it cannot produce grapes it has lost its connection to that which gives it purpose moreover if a branch is severed from the vine that branch becomes separated from everything it requires to sustain life without the vine the branch has no life in it and it will die

7766103 the kingdom of god is as if someone would scatter seed on the ground 27and would sleep and rise night and day and the seed would sprout and grow he does not know how 28the earth produces of itself first the stalk then the head then the full grain in the head 29but when the grain is ripe at once he goes in with his sickle because the harvest has come
7766104 with what can we compare the kingdom of god or what parable will we use for it 31it is like a mustard seed which when sown upon the ground is the smallest of all the seeds on earth 32yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs and puts forth large branches so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade
7766105 the kingdom of god is justice and peace and joy in the holy spirit

7766419 heck la already here liao just do it fail then fail lor already failed thrice for basic wat no big deal
7766420 nikki was the first person to tell me about it after her first visit a few months ago she had returned from a day there completely energised and inspired and it was obvious that she had a big experience there
7766421 when i arrived in chiang mai a few weeks ago i mentioned that i was very keen to go to the park and before i could organise anything she offered to take me there for the day as a treat for my birthday it was a really wonderful idea and i gladly accepted
7766422 its a good question mozzie i discovered from speaking to people there that the loss of habitat is the primary threat to the survival of asian elephants approximately 20 of the worlds population lives within range of them the homes of these elephants are being cleared for many reasons including warfare agricultural development human settlement and logging asian elephants are less prone to poaching killing elephants for ivory tusks because few males and no females grow tusks in china the penalty for poaching is the death sentence
7766423 the iucns species survival commissions asian elephant specialist group estimates that there are approximately 38 000 to 51 000 wild asian elephants in comparison there are more than 600 000 african elephants
7766424 elephants eat a huge amount of food up to 200 kilogrammes per day
7766425 we have come here to load up two whole trucks with food that can no longer be sold at the market it is fine for the elephants and should be just about enough to feed all of them for the day when we get there
7766426 its like the animal equivalent of taking a bottle of wine to a dinner party
7766427 her life quest is to provide a sanctuary for elephants to live in a peaceful natural environment
7766428 we were told that it costs about 250 000 us dollars per year to run the sanctuary and there is no government funding so every penny needs to be created by lek and her team this is why there is a queue of people who pay to volunteer there and there are many other ways in which people can contribute to her amazing work
7766429 leks efforts have been recognised worldwide and numerous stories have appeared on tv and in print media including the national geographic society the awards she has received include guest of honour us humane society 2003 time magazine asian hero of the year 2005 earth day award 2006 and an honourary phd veterinarian science awarded by the hm crown prince of thailand
7766430 anyone witnessing lek with elephants will see a loving bond closeness and a special understanding
7766431 her commitment and extensive field work make her projects unique and it is wonderful that someone like me can see these creatures exactly as they should be in their natural habitat with no pressure to perform tricks or entertain us human beings something which looks cute but invariably means cruelty and hardship for these wonderful animals
7766432 previously i had only ever seen elephants in a zoo
7766433 for such huge creatures i am amazed at how gentle they are and was quite excited at the prospect of feeding them and being able to get so close to them
7766434 i must make sure i get some good pictures for mozzie and our daily explorer readers
7766435 we heard how she had learned about healing from her grandfather a shaman in northeastern thailand who once received an elephant as payment for saving a life she grew up with the animal saw it as a member of the family and over time adopted a characteristic commonly found in female elephants the willingness to treat anothers offspring as their own and to protect them fiercely
7766436 their numbers have dwindled from 100 000 a century ago to between 2 500 and 5 000 today and logging has destroyed much of their habitat
7766437 lek doesnt object to elephants being used for labour but she has taken in animals that have been blinded shot beaten burned maimed or left for dead after accidents to abusive owners they are tools to her they are individuals with names hope liberty jungle boy pooky and personalities as unique as those of humans
7766438 as the number of humans increases the area of natural habitat that the elephants rely on is being depleted they are being forced onto farming areas where they cause damage
7766439 they eat them with the skins on a whole bunch at a time
7766440 they come mainly from private owners and she has had to negotiate fees to enable them to join her herd
7766441 which is another reason that they work hard on the funding side of things some of the animals have outlived their usefulness to loggers while others have become useless to trekking camp owners
7766442 her programmes are focused around local culture common sense and a deep conviction in the preservation of her home area
7766443 sustainability is the key term to describe her efforts elephant volunteers from around the world assist her in a unique programme involving learning physical help and education
7766444 after i got over my initial nervousness it was wonderful to make contact with these gentle giant creatures
7766445 their skin is really rough and hairy and over an inch thick
7766446 it is incredible how loving the atmosphere here really is
7766447 as well as the elephants lek and her staff provide shelter for many stray dogs who all seem to love it here and co exist with the elephants without any difficulty
7766448 they have one elephant who even lets his dog friend ride on his back
7766449 when we finished eating i couldnt wait to get into the water as i had no idea when or if i would get another opportunity to get this close to these amazing docile creatures
7766450 their handlers were really encouraging and made sure that everyone who wanted to could experience the intimacy of bathing which the elephants absolutely love
7766451 although there were plenty of mahouts around i was not taking any chances and quickly backed off
7766452 still it is amazing to be able to experience this at such close quarters
7766453 we were fascinated to discover that asian elephants talk to each other by touch sound and scent
7766454 when a young asian elephant is stressed and nervous they will go to an adult and place the tip of their trunk in the adults mouth elephants also use a broad range of sounds to communicate recently scientists noticed elephants talk to each other at infrasonic sounds humans are unable to hear levels
7766455 when nikki and i are in chiang mai we sometimes see younger elephants being walked up and down main roads where there is lots of traffic as they are used for begging people pay to feed them for amusement these animals look terrified and are always agitated moving from side to side constantly when they are stationary we now know that this is because they feel the movement of traffic through their feet and it is very scary to them
7766456 there are groups campaigning to ban the use of elephants on the street but unfortunately it still goes on
7766457 i cant turn my back on them i can look in their eyes and see fear somebody has to stand up for them
7766458 but in the morning when i open my window and see them happy that clears all my sadness away
7766459 it clearly reflects the loving atmosphere that lek and her staff create here
7766460 for all of us this was a really magical day we experienced something very special here and if you are ever in chiang mai you just have to come
7766461 they say the lion is the king of the jungle but after coming here today i think it should be changed to the elephant
7766462 oh mozzie i had such a brilliant day nikki spoiled me and from the moment i woke up she had arranged for lots of lovely things to happen
7766463 of course being a leo i just love being looked after
7766464 first off she had arranged for me to have a proper english breakfast at a little boutique hotel in the old city in their small walled garden the thais are not good at doing english style food so finding this kind of breakfast can be very difficult which made this place even more of a treat
7766465 nikki has a wonderful skill in her attention to detail and had even arranged for a copy of the bangkok post my favourite newspaper to be on the table when we arrived
7766466 she knows i love them and rarely organise them for myself
7766467 it says that your life can get even better than this which i find very hard to believe
7766468 at the age of 48 i am healthy have lots of love and friendship in my life and the freedom to explore the world what more could a man truly want
7766469 she has lived in chiang mai long enough to have established some lovely relationships with local people
7766470 her favourite place for a good cup of fresh coffee is called wawee where she has become friends with a charming young thai man called lek left she is learning thai and he is learning english so they make time for conversations to help each other improve he knew that i was taking her away from chiang mai for her birthday so arranged to present her with a special birthday cake with her coffee on her last day in town
7766471 it is a great example of the warmth and kindness of the people in chiang mai
7766472 as a dedicated budget traveller birthdays are one of the best opportunities to blow the budget for a day or two and get a little taste of the finer things in life hua hin is fast becoming one of thailands most popular beach resorts with the growing number of affluent middle class thais and i was interested to find out why
7766473 unfortunately i could not keep it a total surprise as nikki has professional commitments in chiang mai so i needed to find out from her when she might be available for a short trip
7766474 once i knew when we could go i arranged everything and booked us in for a couple of nights at the best five start hotel i could find
7766475 it was only the second time we had done something like this since we stayed at the
7766476 the town was definitely not quite as nice as we had imagined and made us really appreciate how great chiang mai is by comparison
7766477 i was looking for a place with a bit of history and character something with a story
7766478 i discovered it was built on completion of the southern railway in the 1930s in a traditional colonial style and was then called the railway hotel it was the start of the town becoming a resort
7766479 the building itself is very impressive and is the only low rise hotel left along the beach with huge well manicured gardens and acres of space in recent years the building has been acquired by the french sofitel group and is maintained in all of its colonial glory for the pleasure of well heeled guests
7766480 spending so much time in thailand we do take massages a bit for granted
7766481 but it is still lovely to come to a stunningly beautiful spa like this one and receive the royal treatment especially as a birthday treat
7766482 so i invited her over to the hotel for high tea which was served daily in the museum cafe
7766483 it has been my constant companion on my travels for the last three or four years and has proved to be very popular with readers in our previous

7766490 jonas has got it in him to be thought of every bit as much as david ginola but in a different way definitely
7766491 he has got so many assets he is not just one thing or two things he has got loads more
7766492 i said a few weeks ago i think the fans are really going to take to him
7766493 but i think the biggest thing they will like about his performance at old trafford wasnt the long runs and the fact that he went past people and kept the ball well it will just be the fact that it meant so much for him to play football and be in a team that wasnt going to be beaten
7766494 if i rest players i will have to call some of you guys in and looking at you i think that would be a big mistake
7766495 people sometimes say when you are in a good position you need to go to a better team
7766496 but i have something to pay back to the club when the club have done something good for you you have to be aware of it and do something good for the club
7766497 they did it to ask me how i am doing in the venezuelan domestic league and what my situation will be in december
7766498 they can offer a contract for several years but i dont know who the team is
7766499 i have only spoken with him aparicio i havent spoken with anyone of wigan or other teams
7766500 i would like to be called by a coach because that would make me certain that i will have the chance to play
7766501 i have also been called from mexico to ask me if i am interested in going back there but i havent been told the name of the team
7766502 my transfer belongs to union maracaibo and i think that i would be better to wait until december because i dont think that they want to cancel my contract at this moment

7766525 i remember how after winning that first game each game got more and more intense after that
7766526 as the winning kept going the overall atmosphere in the locker room kept getting higher and higher the whole week was spent focusing on that game that week there was a lot of leadership
7766527 he can be a goofy guy but the way he carried himself in the locker room and the way brian does now taught me a lot about what we need for this season
7766528 the 04 team played with a lot of swagger and confidence
7766529 you knew when the game started it was going to be a great game its good to experience that kind of stuff and absolutely i can say its all about playing with swagger

7766551 in israel where political academic and business leaders tend to be outspoken there is a striking reticence at the mention of sheldon adelson
7766552 a right wing extremist who is convinced that israel is governed by a corrupt unpatriotic and illegitimate government
7766553 publishes only what adelson himself would want to read if he could read hebrew that is the same agenda day in day out relentlessly this is the stuff propaganda is made of not journalism
7766554 however much influence adelsons wealth has brought him in the us in the last few years it is modest compared with his sway in israel
7766555 the papers objective is to make bibi netanyahu prime minister
7766556 i saw a gambling tycoon from las vegas who bought my countrys birthday with three million dollars i thought with sorrow is the country worth so very little were the champagne wine and sushi that were given out for free in the lobby breaking convention for such events worth the humiliation
7766557 people who are diametrically opposed to his politics refuse to be interviewed
7766558 you tell your prime minister that i need to know whats right for your people because at the end of the day its going to be my policy not condis but i cant be more catholic than the pope
7766559 secretary rice dont promote a state for palestinians while their 10 commandments promote terrorism and israels destruction
7766560 osama bin laden and hamas would be proud of abbas fatah constitution
7766561 olmert is now chasing peace with the palestinians at all costs in a desperate attempt to secure his place in world history
7766562 i dont continue to support organizations that help friends committing suicide just because they want to jump
7766563 a man with a grand vision and a big pair of brass monkeys
7766564 it has been a curse to my people way back in history like opium
7766565 i said well that all depends how many people can come there
7766566 people seem to be living a good life in china
7766567 look at the incredible progress china has made how can someone say theyre doing the wrong thing
7766568 i dont think the u s should be the policeman of the whole world
7766569 chinas abominable human rights record violates the spirit of the games and should disqualify beijing from consideration
7766570 the link between sheldon adelson and right wing religious christians is the commonality of a strong israel
7766571 so it just happens to be sheldon has taken tom delay to israel and hes a friend
7766572 sheldon folds his cell phone up and says to the mayor of beijing im going to do my best
7766573 about three hours later delay calls and he tells sheldon youre in luck
7766574 weidner also instructed the sandss lobbyists in washington patton boggs to suggest to the chinese embassy that adelson and las vegas sands were involved in the process that stalled the bill
7766575 i am asking the speaker and the majority leader no longer to bottle up our legislation and to allow the representatives of the american people to speak their minds on this issue mr speaker allow us a vote
7766576 were in the midst of a twelve billion development in macao
7766577 certainly theres been a lot of rumor and speculation about the ho family and its business activities it was only prudent for us to get the lay of the land
7766578 but we wouldnt have done it even if there were a possibility of a partnership because theyre not good partnership material
7766579 haley called and he said that when he heard these las vegas sands executives were coming to see him he was excited
7766580 he thought they wanted to make a major investment in mississippi
7766581 haley said i realized after a few minutes that those guys dont like competition
7766582 when he wants something its a fixation its 24 7 what he did here was his right to do
7766583 in my sixty three years in business in over fifty different businesses ive broken the mold and changed the status quo
7766584 they always derided they always demonized our convention strategy and look whos laughing last
7766585 i know that a lot of people think that guys like me succeed by stepping on the broken backs of employees and other people
7766586 but they dont understand that we too have philosophies and ideals that we adhere to very scrupulously
7766587 you know these wine and celery affairs wine and cheese affairs and me i wanted hot dogs and hamburgers and pastrami sandwiches
7766588 little did they know that these were communist infiltrated cells but every one of them had the same story
7766589 they went to soir es and the conversation consisted of why they were here on earth
7766590 if i make other people feel good i feel good
7766591 he had a t shirt on and was eating chinese food out of a carton he said work with me jason and were going to be dealing with ministers i said what church he said no not church ministers of countries i was skeptical knowing his past history
7766592 since he was a young businessman sheldons attitude has been spend millions on defense and never settle
7766593 why scratch like a chicken when you can roar like a lion
7766594 there were people who feared him they would just shudder when sheldon walked through
7766595 about a month later sheldon came back and said you guys have done this all wrong you didnt follow my directions
7766596 alan rice said stop for a second going to play a tape of the meeting for you
7766597 he said that before he heard the word hed always thought he was a floater with a short attention span
7766598 the evidence during the 14 day trial depicted like something from the playwright arthur miller a harsh demanding unfeeling successful businessman frustrated in his inability to actuate his self indulgent substance abusing over pampered and as he believes ungrateful sons
7766599 defendant adelson although perhaps lacking paternal kindliness and indeed cordiality generally did not mislead cheat or defraud plaintiffs
7766600 so verbally abusive i was very upset because no one had ever talked to me like he talked to me
7766601 why is it fair that i should be paying a higher percentage of taxes than anyone else
7766602 he explained to me what republicanism was all about so i got to learn about it and i switched immediately
7766603 old democrats were with the union and he wanted to break the back of the union consequently he had to break the back of the democrats
7766604 she violated attorney client privilege and after two warnings i decided to fire her shelley berkley attacks me in order to draw attention away from her own ethical lapses
7766605 my relationship with him began to sour the moment i urged him to hold jobs open at the venetian for former sands workers the more i encouraged cooperation with the workers the more i incurred mr adelsons wrath
7766606 over time i observed mr adelson plot vendettas against anyone whom he believed stood in his way however minuscule the perceived affront he was certain to go ballistic using his money and position to bully any opponent great or small into submission he has funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars to the republican party to support his handpicked candidate by attacking me on tv
7766607 i have unique personal knowledge of how mr adelson seeks to dominate politics and public policy through the raw power of money shortly before i was fired from the sands by mr adelson in 1997 he made me an offer it was a bizarre proposition but it was simple and it was direct he told me if i would switch from the democratic party to the republican party he would provide all the campaign funding i would need to run for congress
7766608 adelson got in my car and said where did you get this
7766609 i had an armored car made by bmw that cost a half million dollars and had windows so thick that it was an exercise for your arms to close the door
7766610 theyre done because sheldons an ideologue he really cares about things that are of the spirit and not of the pocketbook
7766611 what their spokespeople say is there is a need for more balanced journalism in israel like what fox news says in the u s
7766612 but yes the papers objective is to make bibi netanyahu prime minister
7766613 in israel newspapers have a large impact on the public mind
7766614 is a great admirer of israel and knows better than any israeli what is best for this country when it comes to his views on the israeli palestinian conflict he is a right wing extremist who is convinced that israel is governed by a corrupt unpatriotic and illegitimate government billionaires with a political agenda spell trouble in any kind of media outlet but in israel where the political system decides on matters of existential importance all the more so
7766615 adelsons project on the other hand publishes only what adelson himself would want to read if he could read hebrew that is
7766616 the same agenda day in day out relentlessly this is the stuff propaganda is made of not journalism
7766617 the prime minister has on more than one opportunity had occasion to meet with the publisher of this material who for some reason did not conceal his political views or the political aims of his printed material not to mention the fact that this same publisher meddles in the israeli political scene meeting with coalition members and trying to persuade them to quit the government
7766618 when the government began negotiating with the palestinians regarding core issues
7766619 i like fakhravar because he says that if we attack the iranian people will be ecstatic
7766620 i really dont care what happens to iran i am for israel
7766621 there is no commitment that it will be two hundred million dollars a year they will go project by project and there is no real mission there are hundreds of thousands of applicants and the foundation will go through those applications
7766622 he looked at every detail of the program flight schedules contracts everything
7766623 with sheldons approach and with his being the biggest donor you literally know you have the money just in time to start spending it
7766624 and time was short so they realized they should talk to sheldon
7766625 i think jews should have lots of sex that is the solution to our demographic problem
7766626 i saw a gambling tycoon from las vegas who bought my countrys birthday with three million dollars i thought with sorrow is the country worth so very little were the champagne wine and sushi that were given out for free in the lobby breaking convention for such events worth the humiliation
7766627 there is a discernible amount of self censorship going on
7766628 there is no ideological justification for what sheldon is doing among the israeli intelligentsia and a revulsion at an american weighing in so heavily on israeli politics in such a crude reactionary way but they wont speak
7766629 the companys lawsuit happy history and sorry nevada regulatory record wont help
7766630 a fine and regulatory costs after casino bosses rigged a 2002 contest
7766631 smith deceptively manipulates language quotations and sources in order to concoct the smear that adelson had dealings with the boston mob when adelson was in the vending machine business smiths claims are baseless
7766632 adelson a pillar of the community known for his philanthropic endeavors is not and has never been affiliated with organized crime
7766633 no evidence exists that adelsons early vending machine business activity was ever targeted by the patriarca crime family or the winter hill gang
7766634 i had agreed to publish in my column which is read by far more people than ever read or will read the book the most dramatic correction of my career but whatever i agreed to do they would then ask for more
7766635 we engaged in settlement negotiations with mr smith in good faith at the start of the negotiations we asked for 1 and an apology separate and apart from that we offered to establish a 200 000 medical fund for mr smiths daughter whose condition mr adelson learned about during the case mr smith turned down the trust and would not pay the dollar
7766636 mr adelson wanted to enter a judgment against me which would have been the same thing as a decision that i had committed constitutional malice
7766637 this was not true and i refused to agree to it
7766638 this whole series of events is nothing more nor less than trying to coerce everyone in journalism to not write anything he doesnt like
7766639 all i wanted was an apology a retraction and 1
7766640 you know i am the richest jew in the world
7766641 i said i never realized your father was sheldon adelson ii
7766642 adelson has said that he is planning how he will become no
7766643 i had a cd on islamic jihad i brought it to the white house and told the chief of staff i would like the president to see this it really is amazing that we have this influence
7766644 the floating of the yuan would be like a grand slam home run world series super bowl and n b a championship game all packed in one for us
7766645 were the largest investor of any kind in the history of china
7766646 you might need a logistics partner to deliver your goods you might need a manufacturer to manufacture your goods you might need a law firm you might need an accounting firm whatever it would take to get you involved in business in china we would the center would help arrange for you
7766647 it has affected his energy and focus and also his perspective on life
7766648 he should have been the happiest guy in the world but he was confronted by this twist of fate that he had all this wealth and all this power but he couldnt walk i think it made him feel that life was not fair to him
7766649 the two problems are money and the willingness of scientists to collaborate

7766701 next up in statement of principles in keeping with western morality are headlined as
7766702 there is real investigative reporting in china its just not done under a free press flag instead practitioners mind an unstated set of rules keeping themselves safe by employing tactics like using excessive jargon and exploiting government rivalries its an evolving dance requiring ingenuity subtlety courage and a willingness to be fired every day

7766711 we thought about a lot of things maybe we should have thought about moving the warehouse 10 to 15 feet closer
7766712 it looks kind of close because the warehouse is so big but then you start walking back there and wow its a looooong way
7766713 anyone who understands elevation understands that you have to hit it that much farther and that much higher to get your target
7766714 its just that all of the conditions would have to be right it has to be perfect
7766715 it could have been 100 feet away its hard to hit that wall from the bench
7766716 i know i could have hit that wall in a game i almost believe i could do it right now in batting practice
7766717 it would be my mission i would never be happy until i hit the warehouse

7766729 i think we have very good leverage over beijing in taiwan we are the biggest newspaper and magazine there which gives us protection because beijing cares more about taiwan than they do hong kong i knew beijing was thinking very much about taiwan and that they dont want bad press there so we built the taiwan business as leverage
7766730 in the old days we struggled through hard times using our own skills and resources now whenever we encounter a problem we think that china may be able to help us the more we are dependent on china the more beijing will be able to maneuver or even control our lives this is a danger but its very subtle weve always rubbed beijing the wrong way but if we dont do that who else will if we dont create a small space for different opinions opposition opinions there will be no competition of ideas and society will lean to one side that would not be good for hong kong
7766731 a lot of the media has gone into self censorship either because theyre so afraid or purely for economic considerations they think that if they lean the chinese governments way they will get financial benefits or that by getting close to power they will become the voice of china
7766732 the fundamental issue is not regulation but morality if i dont care about the people next to me how much can i care about trees and animals in the forest the birds in the air or the fish in the water there is no moral infrastructure
7766733 in other countries when there is a recession you have churches temples charities ngos civic organizations unions and other institutions reaching out to help each other they are shock absorbers in china you dont have any of this organizations that are not governmental are not allowed in china you have two pillars the market and the government if the market fails the government will be dragged down because there is nothing in the middle
7766734 theres no such thing as perpetual motion machines and no economy without cycles we havent seen the booms flip side yet and when we do it is going to be disastrous as the cake becomes smaller in china everyone will fight for it
7766735 some subtle things have been eroded like the legacy of western values free markets small government things like that
7766736 anyone who would differentiate between westernization and modernization is just talking rubbish take out the western culture and what else is modern nothing the technology is western the trendy culture is western all this modernization is westernization china is prosperous today because it deals and interacts with the west no democracy isnt on normal peoples radars yet china will be open to it only when the economic cycle turns down and when that happens china will be in chaos
7766737 how would i feel if someone else did the same thing
7766738 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7766739 an intelligence led operation in oval managed to stop a large group we believed were headed for the carnival to commit such scenes of disorder
7766740 they were all picking up bottles throwing bottles throwing bits of stones throwing anything at the police they possibly could
7766741 i saw police with blood on their faces i saw police getting carried away i saw people who were throwing missiles getting carried away because they were getting batoned as well so we had a full scale battle going on
7766742 there was this one policewoman who got a bottle right on her face and she just dropped on the floor
7766743 like the roman i seem to see the river tiber foaming with much blood
7766744 who of the composers of the 1978 generation is the one least known in the west principally because he never studied abroad

7766746 he told me you reap what you sow which i believe
7766747 the scores even and it just cost him more than it cost me at the time
7766748 well race him like that in the chase if thats what he wants
7766749 he was mad and i can completely empathize with his anger i probably would have done the exact same thing
7766750 but let me make one thing clear im not apologizing for it and thats the way it is
7766751 we have access to soft wall technology but soft wall technology only works if we put it up every other race track i believe except for maybe sonoma has soft walls and its time for watkins glen to follow suit the technology doesnt help us if its not up
7766752 the only way i can explain it is i thought i was really in good shape and i was tough and all that and then i ran my first craftsman truck series race and i couldnt believe how hot it was and how taxing it was
7766753 so id say were athletes i dont know if any of us would do that well in a foot race or anything but these guys are tough thats for sure
7766754 shes just a great friend and a really great person
7766755 last summer we stayed at the wynn for what seemed like a lifetime close to three weeks
7766756 we met at a banquet we got to talking and she really understands the game i told her id make a deal with her that if we won the gold medal id give it to her she thought i was kidding but i told her i had one already and the way they treated us at the wynn it was the least i could do

7766764 you know that perfect guy who you wish you could be with

7766774 well make sure he sees the appropriate doctors and well exhaust every possibility we can think of to see what might be the issue whether it is physical whether it is mechanical and then try to solve it its a process of elimination and well subtract them one at a time
7766775 i think that is going to be determined based on what we learn over the next few days
7766776 im not trying to diminish if theres something wrong with his arm but i think the guy is disappointed
7766777 i think the course of action that guys ought to take all the time is just be upfront just say it
7766778 if youre hurt and you cant pitch or you cant play just let me know goodness sakes
7766779 i am a guy that needs to have a routine where i know i have a chance to go in a game every time i cant go out there and start and then have days off and go out there again
7766780 i took my lickings in the starting rotation but i just feel more comfortable in the pen
7766781 its an adrenaline rush its your best stuff against their best stuff
7766782 i think out of necessity we made him a starter but he wanted to do so well i think he went beyond his limits
7766783 he sure looks a lot more under control and confident
7766784 so are you saying you can measure how long someone stays on the site
7766785 there are many people who are able to keep this virus at bay despite getting exposed they are able to defend themselves against the virus
7766786 while in the conference we waited for the scientists to tell us whether there is a breakthrough in aids vaccine and all admitted failure scientists found it logical to say there is something we can find from these people which can help us in our vaccine research we are now shifting the focus to discordant couples
7766787 these days we are making sure that we treat discordant couples with special need we know it is hard to stay without sex especially among those who are married we give them special consideration and regularly check on their progress
7766788 the number of discordance has increased because more and more people are coming for hiv testing an increase from 5 5 per cent last year to 6 percent this year is awesome its a big achievement if all people in uganda knew their status then we would have gone a long way in fighting this epidemic
7766789 discordance still looks like a mystery but we are not seated we are in laboratories researching on it
7766790 but people have different immunities and therefore some could be having cells which help them resist hiv virus infection
7766791 at times we test couples five times and still find out that one is positive and the other is not we advise such couples to be more careful and in most cases we tell them to abstain from sex we dont want to tell them use condoms because we are trying to avoid risks
7766792 we havent found out why exactly some people are resistant to hiv virus even when they are having sex with an hiv infected person there are many theories to explain the discordance but for us we are trying to find out if such people can continue living together
7766793 i used to stay indoors crying and cursing myself until when i got counselling

7766797 i was not able to get any loans to restart my business because of that yet the liquidators had locked up my money grounded my truck and were still holding on to and selling off cheaply my other properties
7766798 this office has been investigating allegations by a former customer of the co operative bank in liquidation that his account was mismanaged by failure to reflect credits making of false debits and falsely reflecting cash deposits as draft deposits
7766799 may be he has a genuine claim given how aggressively he has pursued this matter
7766800 my money with former co operative bank locked up with action of the liquidator
7766801 by the time the co operative bank closed i had for some years operated two accounts numbers 3895 and 884 at kasese and ishaka respectively on a sound basis
7766802 i have been contacted by many people in the co operative movement who are concerned about the way the matter of liquidating their properties and the bank is being handled

7766829 equity is low risk capital to the business entrepreneurs dont need to worry about making monthly repayments and can reinvest income in growth
7766830 when we are an equity partner our interests as financiers are completely aligned with our investees
7766831 we often recommend to our potential investees that they consider us as an equity partner
7766832 by lending over a medium term or by taking equity positions in our investees we provide them with the breathing space necessary to implement their plans
7766833 we believe that a vibrant and effective private sector is the most sustainable way to increase rural incomes

7766868 i dont want to just introduce my sister i want to introduce you to my sister the girl i grew up with the poised young woman i saw her grow in to the compassionate mother aunt and sister in law she is the passionate voice for women and children she has become and the type of first lady she will be
7766869 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7766870 if this party has a message its done a hell of a job of hiding it
7766871 having worked on the choreography of these before you need to grab peoples attention with a message early on not to let these sort of hours get frittered away
7766872 when i first met jon the director i warned him that im a bit performance masochist and he said good cause we are gonna kick your ass
7766873 what if you were to make a sequel to the descent
7766874 if youre going to do it then lets continue sarahs story
7766875 lets get the same team together and if we cant then lets not bother
7766876 while the outlook remains pretty overcast for the aviation industry the winners will be those airlines that focus on offering the best customer service
7766877 we have diversified our route network focused on providing the best product in upper class premium economy and economy hedged our fuel purchasing and built up a strong cash position

7766880 geneeskunde aan de erasmus universiteit in rotterdam biologie vond ik altijd heel leuk vooral de anatomie van het menselijk lichaam en je krijgt met veel verschillende mensen te maken dat vind ik ook mooi ik heb over de studie psychologie nagedacht maar de grote aandacht voor statistiek en onderzoeksmethodiek trok me minder ik ga nu aan het vijfde van de zes studiejaren beginnen momenteel vervul ik coschappen in het dijkzigt ziekenhuis in rotterdam daarna hoop ik naar het ijsselland ziekenhuis in capelle aan den ijssel te gaan

7766882 de eerste vier jaar zat ik met drie andere studenten in het huis semper paratus op kamers gaan kan ik alle studenten aanraden je wordt er zelfstandig van en bouwt je eigen leven op elke dag heen en weer naar yerseke was voor mij ook niet handig maar een huisgenoot uit capelle aan den ijssel koos ook bewust voor het kamerleven in rotterdam kom je ook makkelijker aan een kamer dan bijvoorbeeld in utrecht of amsterdam inmiddels ben ik getrouwd en hebben we een appartement in rotterdam zuid
7766883 ik ben net van depositum custodi af ook het bezoeken van een christelijke studentenvereniging kan ik elke student aanraden ik had het er enorm naar mijn zin en heb er ook veel geleerd

7766892 its the story of men and women gathered in churches and union halls in town squares and high school gyms
7766893 reminding us how much we share and how alike we really are
7766894 nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7766895 for me this is a season of hope this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans
7766896 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7766897 i know barack obama ive seen his leadership at work ive seen the difference he has made in the lives of people across illinois
7766898 by thursday he will have shown the country that hes one of us
7766899 just then a panel at the back of the cellar opened and out walked peter mauel with a bottle of his
7766900 our purpose is not to create a trade bloc we are committed to open regionalism and adopt an inclusive approach
7766901 demonstrate the practical benefits of economic openness and contribute in a modest way to maintaining the global momentum for trade liberalization
7766902 watchful of any backsliding and resist the temptation to raise trade barriers or resort to protectionist practices for lack of an overall agreement
7766903 we hope to complete negotiations this year officials have made very good progress over the past 12 months and have successfully resolved between 90 and 95 percent of the issues before us
7766904 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards

7766907 the fact the capuchins predominantly selected the prosocial option must mean seeing another monkey receive food is satisfying or rewarding for them
7766908 we believe prosocial behavior is empathy based empathy increases in both humans and animals with social closeness and in our study closer partners made more prosocial choices they seem to care for the welfare of those they know
7766909 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7766910 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7766911 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7766912 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7766913 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7766914 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7766915 biologists have known that in these beetles there is an investment trade off between secondary sexual characters and primary sexual characters as horns get bigger copulatory organs get smaller or vice versa what was not known was how frequently and how fast this can occur in nature and whether this can drive the evolution of new species
7766916 in terms of the integrity of a species its important for these things not to change too much so there is a lot of evidence suggesting that within species or within the populations of species natural selection maintains genital characters but if these primary sex characters are linked to other characters that can change readily then youve got what we think is a very exciting mechanism that could prime populations for reproductive isolation

7766921 the little bit that falls is transported to favored areas there it can melt when it does so it does so quickly and creates enough meltwater to carve gullies
7766922 the slope and shapes of the debris fans at the base of the gullies indicates that they are geologically quite young
7766923 so these things fit into a relatively young time on mars history perhaps even almost up to the present

7766943 north korea is trying to muddle through and delay as much as possible
7766944 at the same time this is a last ditch effort trying to somehow influence u s presidential politics
7766945 i think the timing of the hu jintao visit to south korea was very depressing to the north koreans
7766946 i see it as another card at the negotiation table to urge the u s to remove it from the terrorism blacklist as soon as possible
7766947 such action by north korea will surely hurt foreign investor sentiment towards south korean shares even further i expect foreign exchange markets in particular to be vulnerable to the news
7766948 younger ones started to fight with cleo and because of her age she was starting to have a lot of problems and couldnt deal with that type of situation
7766949 we are putting more emphasis on taking care of our aging population
7766950 obviously we didnt want to compromise her health for a new young breeding pair
7766951 shes a very old animal one of our biggest concerns is shes dropped a lot of weight

7766960 take this man to your room and array him in some of your clothes
7766961 you are now eligible to attend the kings banquet tomorrow night
7766962 but even more important you will never need any other clothes these garments will last forever
7766963 that the two girls had tried to commit suicide just because somebody gave them counselling cannot be believed also this was no counselling if what the girl said was true
7766964 national foods has the capability and financial strength to leverage the acquisition of acf to create new business opportunities domestically and in the vitally important asian region
7766965 the deal looks very good from a long term perspective
7766966 it will turbo charge their growth in europe and give them access to a very good set of clients
7766967 the deal is certainly not cheap but its not highly expensive as well given the kind of synergies that infosys will get
7766968 this will give much better returns on the cash they were sitting on for a long time
7766969 axon is a strategic fit for infosys which has been consistently looking to expand its consulting and package implementation capabilities and also its presence in europe

7766980 the tattoo is addressed pretty definitively in the first episode
7766981 i appreciated that i had to wear long sleeve shirts
7766982 how can we really address this issue that really feels satisfying and gives some closure to people who were constantly on the lookout for it
7766983 im not going to jump into the next bourne supremacy franchise
7766984 because at the end of the day its important to come home and unwind
7766985 parallel administration which is more effective more popular and more brutal than the governments
7766986 if we pull together we can make a world of difference
7766987 we are essentially mimicking what happens in the body when scavenger cells remove dead and abnormal cells
7766988 if the dead cells are not removed then this affects how healthy cells behave
7766989 not only will this make the production of drugs more efficient but it will also streamline research into new medicines which use cell culture
7766990 for over two hours our officers were faced with a hardcore mainly of young men who came to carnival not to enjoy the event but to fight commit crime and cause trouble
7766991 an intelligence led operation in oval managed to stop a large group we believed were headed for the carnival to commit such scenes of disorder
7766992 they were all picking up bottles throwing bottles throwing bits of stones throwing anything at the police they possibly could
7766993 i saw police with blood on their faces i saw police getting carried away i saw people who were throwing missiles getting carried away because they were getting batoned as well so we had a full scale battle going on

7767001 baby boomer women pairing up in the 1970s had it easy
7767002 there were more men than women due to a post war immigration program that favoured men
7767003 this means that the odds for an australian woman of finding a partner have altered over the course of a generation
7767004 there is simply less product for 30 something women in particular to choose from
7767005 men suffer a shelia shortage in their 20s whereas women endure a man drought from 34 onwards
7767006 i have more single male friends than i do single female friends at the moment but when i look at my girlfriends in their 30s most of them are single and my older male friends are all shacking up
7767007 the reason im still single is that im too choosy not that there arent enough men my age
7767008 one cited the man drought as being a reason for going as she keeps hearing there are plenty of single guys in the uk she said

7767024 i would say some people thought we were going to die
7767025 i knew it wasnt an engine problem there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7767026 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask on to my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
7767027 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7767028 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7767029 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7767030 from where i was sitting i could see about 20 masks and only a few of them were inflating it was extremely variable as to who got oxygen in their masks and the cabin crew didnt seem to know what to do
7767031 the oxygen masks were working the correct safety procedures were followed
7767032 the first thing we do in these situation is divert to safety take the safety first option we have to require that the pilots and the cabin crew also deploy their oxygen masks
7767033 they cant be making passenger announcements when they have their oxygen masks on
7767034 as the passengers confirmed the pilot did make an announcement once he got down to 8 000ft where it is safe to take the oxygen masks off that they were diverting to limoges
7767035 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy
7767036 as a safety precaution the captain descended and diverted the aircraft to limoges airport
7767037 all 168 passengers disembarked safely upon landing a total of 16 passengers together with five accompanying family members have transferred at their request to a local hospital complaining of earache
7767038 as a precaution limoges airport have arranged a local doctor to be available to any other passengers should they require
7767039 the walking wounded are now having to go on an eight hour bus trip if wed wanted to travel by road to spain wed have taken the car
7767040 wilf and freya are fine now and are sleeping it off
7767041 our engineers have inspected the aircraft overnight and have confirmed that the oxygen masks which deployed were working properly
7767042 in accordance with ryanairs safety procedure during this de pressurisation incident the pilots and cabin crew also deployed their oxygen masks until the aircraft made a controlled descent to 8 000ft at which stage it was safe for the pilot to make a public address announcement advising all passengers that they would be diverting as a safety precaution to limoges airport where ryanair were arranging for a replacement aircraft to take them onwards to their destination in barcelona girona
7767043 ryanair will this morning be in contact with all the passengers on board the aircraft to communicate our sincere apologies for any distress or delay the passengers on board may have suffered due to this depressurisation incident
7767044 ryanair has already notified the irish and french aviation authorities and a full investigation of this incident will be undertaken later today
7767045 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7767046 something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7767047 those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7767048 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for a world as it should be and that is the thread that connects our hearts
7767049 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbably journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7767050 and you see that is why i love this country
7767051 for the first time in my adult lifetime im really proud of my country
7767052 i have come here tonight to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7767053 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender of group against group and of straight against gay
7767054 and barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
7767055 this is what we do we reach the moon we scale the heights i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again
7767056 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and for me our country will be committed to his cause
7767057 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7767058 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7767059 he has now been assessed under the character test as having passed so he will be given a visa
7767060 snoop dogg trades in toxic messages of menace violence misogyny and lawlessness
7767061 i think its fair to say there was muffled consternation in the first few seconds
7767062 people were clearly suffering with the shock of it but on the whole people had a stiff upper lip about it and they were resigned to their fate they were properly terrified
7767063 they thought they were going to meet their maker and thats not an exaggeration
7767064 chinese refiners are unable to match gains from the high price of crude oil in international markets due to controls on retail prices

7767169 frankly the rapidly increasing scarcity of great 19th century rugs
7767170 combined with our clienteles escalating knowledge and the ability to view and purchase one in the world investment level rugs on our website have created a unique confluence of factors during my nearly 30 years in the business
7767171 collectible to museum level rugs that are both rare works of art and still in the superb condition that they can be used on the owners residences
7767172 potential clients who have been drawn to great antique rugs over the last three decades often come to him with a seasoned eye and a great hunger in drought like conditions in the international market
7767173 many clients continue to purchase spectacular pieces more than they could possibly display in their homes and either ask us to store them or are putting them into private museums we often revolve clients rugs over periods of time at one or more of their residences
7767174 our clients soon discover that the quality of carpets we consistently offer is virtually never found elsewhere and when they occasionally do appear at auction they often sell for prices that exceed the established market value
7767175 the 100 to 200 year old rugs in our collection can never be duplicated such as handmade area rugs silk rugs persian rugs oriental rugs wool rugs etc they were created at time when the artistic sensitivity of the weavers and their craftsmanship were unmatched
7767176 in that sense rug collectors view their pieces in the manner that a collector of paintings views a monet or van gogh
7767177 additionally the market for rugs of this quality does not fluctuate depending on external economic conditions
7767178 the intrinsic value of this kind of art and its one of a kind quality separates it from other kinds of investments

7767194 we wait for purushottam the way a farmer waits for rains to come this is the only competition that has a tradition of years and it is this tradition and culture that the spirit of purushottam is associated with
7767195 the spirit of purushottam goes beyond competition i have been participating in this event since last three years and the best part about it is that we are more theatre lovers than participants we all gather here to compete but then if the performance is good even the opponents cheer for you
7767196 it is the spirit of the event and the respect for theatre that gets me here every year i am known as a make up artist today because of purushottam i have been witnessing this competition since years and i must say that students are extremely emotional about the event the world outside has changed mobile phones laptops have started influencing the scripts and the technical aspects of theatre but what has been constant over years is the dedication enthusiasm and sincerety with which students have been taking part in purushottam
7767197 our rules and regulations are very artist centric this is a competition and we want to treat this as a competition only this is not commercial theatre where audience is the deciding factor this is the stage by the students and for the students and anything that can bother the participants or the performers is prohibited here
7767198 instead of going to a management school students should participate in this event atleast once in their lives it teaches you so many things as a commercial artist you just have to do your bit in the drama but here at purushottam it is about everything from pr to finance to lights and sound acting direction and the minutest of the aspects of theatre all these might look like problems for outsiders but for the ones passionate about theatre this is worship for initial some days these botherations affect your performance but then comes the day of the first stage rehearsal and then after the first rehearsal the efforts dissolve and the differences disappear what reflects at that time is the team spirit that strives only for one thing performance and applause
7767199 shona urvashis first film chupke se was a disaster nobody knows about her first film this is her second film i hope she makes a better film this time
7767200 i signed because warner brothers who are producing the film had approached me warner brothers is an international giant so i could not refuse them
7767201 they are senior actors with a lot of experience i had a great learning experience while working with them in the movie
7767202 i am playing a character which is more real and underplayed it has been an experimental experience as i have done something which i had never done before
7767203 i wont reveal much about what i do in the movie as that will take away the charm of watching it but one thing i can say for sure is that people will not see me running around trees or performing any dance or item numbers
7767204 it is a character based film which touches on various subjects and relationships the usp of the movie will be its script and the presence of veteran actors
7767205 i am still waiting for a compliment from ekta maam
7767206 i went to see her once and i was casually dressed she ekta failed to recognise me then when someone told her that this is heer then she said oh i thought you would be dressed in some salwar kameez i had to tell her that i dont dress up like heer in real life
7767207 mamta taught me the technicality of working left right left brought me initial recognition amber dhara added to it and kis desh has added stars to my career
7767208 i never used to go to college on saturdays but that day i went and heard that auditions were on at the campus i was wearing my night dress and they asked me to audition i had never faced a camera before so i was scared but i was chosen i didnt really have to struggle
7767209 a main lead is not supposed to be seen everywhere
7767210 the show is now joined by shilpa shetty she looked lovely as always and very trim she displayed mock anger at meeting me because i missed wishing her on her birthday horrible me
7767211 i wish it goes off even better this year though i must remember not to miss it again
7767212 my director abhishek kapoor was very clear that whoever plays the lead singer of the band in the movie should sing the songs himself if the character is about a singer and the songs are being dubbed then it looks a bit fake
7767213 it is the authenticity factor that comes in between however my singing worked really well in context to the movie
7767214 we have tried to bring a slight respect to the sincerity in our work from the audiences point of view by my singing
7767215 i have been singing and playing the guitar for a while this is for the first time that i have sung professionally and i had a great guide in the form of shankar mahadevan
7767216 still it was not much of hard work because i had a certain amount of ability to sing and play the guitar in comparison to arjun rampal and purab kohli who come from a non music background vis vis luke kenny who still has a little hang of it
7767217 the matter is subjudice this will go on for a while and we plan to tackle it like any other court case we are very close to the films release
7767218 it is a fun film and a family entertainer the film has nothing in common with the harry potter franchise as the story suggests the hari puttar name has been in the news and has appeared at places since the last 18 months
7767219 it talks about the freedom of a child when he is left alone in the house with his cousin and the funny situations that follow when two burglars try getting into the house to get hold of a chip that his father has been secretly working on
7767220 by diverting capital resources into funding to increase direct black ownership of banks we would be incorrectly constrained to move the focus away from much needed productive and transformational initiatives like low income housing small enterprise development black agricultural projects and access to financial services by marginalised communities

7767237 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints
7767238 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive

7767505 this project started as a series of surrealistic games as a comment on the way that manhattan works essentially the project became a game of the grid looking at manhattan corner conditions acting as landmarks within the city that reaffirm and deform that grid at that point the site then had to be a corner acting as a microcosm of the city

7767512 guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum
7767513 we call on the government to guarantee appropriate sex and relationship education in every primary and secondary school by putting personal social and health education on a statutory basis as part of the national curriculum
7767514 international evidence suggests that high quality sex and relationship education that puts sex in its proper context that starts early enough to make a difference and that gives youngsters the confidence and ability to make well informed decisions helps young people delay their first sexual experience and leads to lower teenage pregnancy levels

7767523 our results might explain why the strategy of using erbb2 inhibitors alone to treat breast cancers has fallen short these findings may also suggest a way to treat patients with advanced erbb2 positive tumours and those whove developed resistance to erbb2 inhibitors an idea that were eager to test

7767551 our work uncovers an achilles heel of influenza a viruses that cause human epidemics and high mortality pandemics we have identified the structure of a key target site for drugs that could be developed to effectively combat this disease
7767552 the x ray crystal structure gives us unique insights into how the ns1 and human protein bind at the atomic level and how that suppresses a crucial antiviral response
7767553 these experiments validate the ns1 pocket as a target for antiviral drug discovery because this ns1 pocket is highly conserved in all influenza a viruses isolated from humans a drug targeted to the pocket would be effective against all human influenza a strains including the bird flu
7767554 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7767555 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7767556 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7767557 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7767558 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7767559 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7767560 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7767561 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7767562 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7767563 with the continuing decline of the ogallala aquifer water level and increasing cost of pumping water the use of drought tolerant and high yield corn hybrids is a key for sustainable corn production under limited irrigation
7767564 we hope to reduce the amount of water required for corn by at least 10 percent
7767565 the new multiple stress tolerant corn lines can be used to produce corn hybrids adapted to texas and other southern states they can be a powerful tool to save water and produce crops with yield and grain quality under stressful environments
7767566 most of our breeding efforts start by crossing tropical corn with temperate elite lines then we select for desirable traits to broaden genetic diversity and introduce useful genes from exotic corn to improve stress tolerance agronomic productivity disease resistance insect resistance and value added grain characteristics
7767567 at 75 percent evapotranspiration you have 3 to 4 inches of available moisture that is used where if you are watering at 100 percent it is wasted
7767568 one of our experimental hybrids produced the same amount of silage in both locations when irrigation was reduced from 100 percent to 75 percent
7767569 developing and using new corn hybrids with improved tolerance to drought and other stresses is important and a viable water saving approach
7767570 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7767571 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7767572 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7767573 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7767574 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7767575 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7767576 i had no knowledge of it and i certainly wouldn
7767577 i dont know if it would even work i would never cheat in the game bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brylcreem helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7767578 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7767579 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7767580 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7767581 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7767582 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7767583 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7767584 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7767585 its unbelievable the regeneration has vastly improved the area we all know each other and its a very friendly place there should be a good community spirit i hope this new home will make a difference to my life
7767586 its great to see mandale once again being shortlisted for national recognition the scheme has brought about a massive change to the look of the estate with a positive impact on peoples quality of life
7767587 being shortlisted recognises the hard work of everyone involved in the scheme and is a great example of how to create sustainable mixed tenure estates its good to see despite the credit crunch the development continues to be popular with both barratt and haslam homes continuing to sell family properties

7767589 the clinical team dr z and r have expressed their views and to be fair to them dr z has perhaps a more stronger way presented concerns about delusional disorder
7767590 i have given a commitment to people in the 9 11 truth movement to continue requesting an apology until i have been given one
7767591 if i have not received an apology by august the 30th instead of protesting in auckland as i did last year i will be protesting outside whangarei base hospital
7767592 i did not do anything i did not do anything
7767593 the person in front of meyer was told he would be the last person to speak orlando said meyer said he was upset with that so kerry gave him the ok when he took the mike meyer then asked kerry several questions on amateur video linked from meyers website his questions included why kerry conceded in the 2004 presidential election why not impeach president george w bush now and whether kerry was a member of the skull and bones secret society at yale university
7767594 the person in front of meyer was told he would be the last person to speak orlando said meyer said he was upset with that so kerry gave him the ok
7767595 anything that is complex is not useful and anything that is useful is simple this has been my whole lifes motto
7767596 if the incident had been reversed and it had been an atheist that had physically assaulted a theist for postering for a theist event that would easily be considered a hate crime and it frequently is this is the exact reverse scenario
7767597 they are treating it not as a hate crime but as a dispute that arose and led to an altercation
7767598 we dont have anything that suggests that as far as im aware of i know mr trottier was talking about that but certainly from what i see it doesnt look like it falls within what our policies and procedures define as a hate crime
7767599 but were still looking at that as well to cover all the bases
7767600 the first individual smacked me in the face twice and said
7767601 atheists have never been accorded the same respect as those with religious beliefs even though our position originates in logic and reason not myth and superstition this escalation of a systemic although till now hidden discrimination is very troubling
7767602 i think i discovered the hard way the boundaries of freedom of speech
7767603 the fact that an atheist should fear for his well being while advertising for a university event that seeks to promote free inquiry is alarming and though i feared for my life briefly ive never felt as strong about my atheism my colleagues and i have only strengthened our resolve to forge ahead with our agenda to push for secularism science and freedom of thought
7767604 you can turn me over i am done on this side
7767605 love your enemies do good to those who hate and persecute you

7767618 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one

7767620 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7767621 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7767622 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7767623 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did

7767625 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7767626 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7767627 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7767628 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7767629 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7767630 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7767631 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7767632 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7767633 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7767634 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7767635 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7767636 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7767637 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7767638 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7767639 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7767640 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7767641 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7767642 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7767643 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7767644 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7767645 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7767646 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7767647 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7767648 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7767649 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7767650 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7767651 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7767652 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7767653 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7767654 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7767655 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7767656 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7767657 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7767658 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7767659 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7767660 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best

7767678 calling the brilliant things people create online user generated content is like sliding up to your lady and saying lets have intercourse
7767679 oh it is under 20 i can deal with that
7767680 but they sent out my order wrong that is not my fault and i just want to go
7767681 nobody wants to go to town meeting to cut jobs
7767682 i think we did the best we could to present the real financial problem we were really trying to think ahead but it seems town meeting wants to proceed as reactionary and to address only the 200 000 because thats the real problem
7767683 all department heads agreed that the town only has a 200 000 shortage all department heads have agreed to support the budget amendment
7767684 send a message to the board of selectmen and advisory board for at least the fourth time after failed town meetings and override elections that you as residents will have spoken in opposition to these two boards budget solving proposals
7767685 can you imagine a 47 million company not auditing its books
7767686 we dont need to go through another year of budget cycles to figure out that fiscal 2010 is going to be a completely total mess
7767687 after attending tonights town meeting i am gravely concerned that our current form of government has completely broken down the dysfunctional relationships between our town boards and department heads combined with the apathy of many citizens and closed mindedness of many others is destroying bridgewater

7767787 however even though member states have made significant progress in making cultural content accessible on the internet more public and private investment is needed to speed up digitisation my goal is to have a european digital library called europeana and rich in content open to the public before the end of the year

7767795 we will provide a government supported place for every eligible student who wants to train re train or boost their qualifications in the victorias training sector
7767796 this will not only be a major win for students but will make it easier for mothers wanting to return to work workers seeking to increase their skills and victorians wanting to train in growth industries

7767800 people with recent industry experience will be encouraged to take up part time teaching while still working in industry
7767801 if you think you can you can and if you think you cant youre right
7767802 we think its a superb opportunity for the athletes and will enhance our medal potential in 2012
7767803 one of the greatest experiences we could give them was a trip to the olympic village with 16 500 living in there and a dining area that seats 5 000 it can be fairly daunting for a lot of young athletes
7767804 i remember what it was like for my first olympics i was completely terrified and quite overwhelmed
7767805 luckily i did ok in atlanta but if i can impart some of my knowledge or offer any advice to these young athletes then i think its a job well done
7767806 you need to almost demystify the olympics you need to treat it as just another competition these guys are good enough there are some athletes here on the programme who were painfully close to making the team
7767807 if you can allow them to see what its like so they are not completely blown away by the experience then hopefully theyll be the best prepared athletes going into the london games
7767808 getting the chance to come here and experience the atmosphere was amazing
7767809 i was looking at the track and thinking what it would be like to be down there with all those people in the stands looking at me i tried to imagine what it would it be like if they were all there to see me
7767810 i think the best thing about coming here is that ive now seen for myself that the olympics are just another tournament
7767811 despite sitting in the rain for two hours at thursdays open water race i wouldnt have wanted to be anywhere else
7767812 it was brilliant to watch the best athletes in the world and it just filled me with a load of emotions that i want to be there next time

7767822 ive been around long enough to know that you dont look at seven weeks and say its all over and things are back to normal
7767823 the numbers that are available to us see us as the biggest player actually growing ahead of the market place
7767824 the numbers ive been looking at show our competitor growing less than the market
7767825 the mathematics of that means that the gap must be opening
7767826 yes we are looking for acquisitions both domestically and internationally
7767827 rest assured we are going to be very prudent were going to make sure were buying businesses that are high volume low margin businesses
7767828 that doesnt mean as things stabilise were not going to do capital management
7767829 capital management is something weve done before and well very clearly do again to keep the balance sheet efficient
7767830 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7767831 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing

7767932 at times and with increasing frequency now i experience a kind of clarity that ive never seen adequately described in a football story sometimes for example time seems to slow way down in an uncanny way as if everyone were moving in slow motion it seems as if i have all the time in the world to watch the receivers run their patterns and yet i know the defensive line is coming at me just as fast as ever i know perfectly well how hard and fast those guys are coming and yet the whole thing seems like a movie or a dance in slow motion its beautiful

7767939 i think the best part of this story is that our taggers were looking for beach tags well have to give her a little award or something

7767965 unlike their predecessors current elites have very few ties with rwandan rural life
7767966 whereas the pre 1994 elite largely depended upon a rural power base to maintain their position the current elite depends almost exclusively upon an urban peer group and the international donor community for support
7767967 it lacks strategic plans and budgetary commitments to counter those undesirable processes that weaken or threaten peoples livelihoods and lives

7767995 nothing says it more than when she brought those girls out
7767996 as the presidential campaign turns increasingly personal and the new obama biden ticket strikes a decidedly more populist tone democrats believe a mccain romney ticket would provide a near perfect frame for their class conscious message
7767997 it will be a contest theyll say between the son of a single mother and son of a car salesman against the son of an admiral and son of a governor
7767998 and even those who are not passionately committed to one side or the other are trying to figure out why obama didnt just go through the motions of vetting clinton for the vice presidency tell her that she was high on the list and go through the entire process it wouldnt have been true and clinton probably would have known it wasnt true but what could she have done as it turned out since obama blew her off she can now claim that she was disrespected in all this

7768000 when i was a young boy my childhood dream was to become a chimney sweep but i knew you would never sanction such an ambition and i have lived with the failure ever since
7768001 if ever i see you with a sweeping brush in your hands i swear i will kill you

7768004 we need to begin to understand why were having this level of violence in our community
7768005 it will not end the drought it will make a dent
7768006 if we dont dry out the cotton is going to be impacted a lot more than it is right now
7768007 the area that it serves would be helpful to us
7768008 we would welcome them taking any all of our programs but that would be determined
7768009 this is something that will really give them an opportunity to do things that are really widely distributed
7768010 if theyre just virulently opposed to this then through the metropolitan planning organization and their legislative delegation they ought to be communicating that to the dot commissioner
7768011 re evaluate scale down go back to the drawing board

7768015 unconscionable that this project is not being studied with the degree of technical and public scrutiny it surely deserves
7768016 its just a question of the state prioritizing where funds should be invested
7768017 especially in an economic time like this you want to look at investments that are going to have a strong long term impact and child care is something that can
7768018 theres sort of been this level of need hovering around 80 000 but in terms of whats being served its kind of been more like 55 thousand and 60 thousand
7768019 now we see dhr moving in a direction of serving a five year low of children
7768020 adding 100 million in additional funds over five years is a very ambitious target given the current status of the federal and state budgets
7768021 dhr has the capacity to increase the size of the child care system should more funds become available
7768022 when i was a young boy my childhood dream was to become a chimney sweep but i knew you would never sanction such an ambition and i have lived with the failure ever since
7768023 if ever i see you with a sweeping brush in your hands i swear i will kill you
7768024 you are a loser a failure youre washed up never to recover always to be known as one who didnt measure up to the call

7768072 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7768073 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7768076 how could i resist i was handcuffed i was crying
7768077 he asked me if i was working on the street
7768078 they should be embarrassed and ashamed of themselves for trying to create this kind of hysteria
7768079 in the aftermath of intense negative reaction from the public in the other case now they want to come back with this suit and act like they are riding to the rescue when all they are really doing is riding in an ambulance some people chase ambulances they are literally in the ambulance

7768094 this shocking incident underscores the terrible dangers and threats that continue to face journalists in somalia
7768095 we call for them to be set free immediately the somali authorities must act urgently to see our colleagues come to no harm
7768096 we are worried about their safety as we have had no contact with anybody saying they are holding the journalists and their driver
7768097 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7768098 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens

7768104 i think of most bloggers as almost like the 19th century press its a very partisan bunch
7768105 bloggers might be the most likely commentators to go offscript
7768106 bloggers are so ubiquitous they actually might be more likely to be on the scene of something interesting and newsworthy than mainstream reporters
7768107 anyone who can write a sentence is welcome to blog the news
7768108 a blogger who writes about farming will ask delegates about farm policy
7768109 youll never get that with the mainstream media because theyre always focused on the horse race
7768110 the air transport system is safe and trustworthy the safety control system we have while it can be improved is very efficient and meets global standards
7768111 what happened is that monday morning when the plane carrying the body of the late zambian president levy patrick mwanawasa arrived at the chipata airport and the former first lady was on the same aircraft when she disembarked and went to the tent where the other dignitaries were mr sata kneeled before her to greet her but she told him she did not want to politicize the funeral she therefore asked him to leave the procession when mr sata tried to explain why he was there the former first lady interjected and said that she did not want to talk to him
7768112 in fact the national chairman of the governing movement for multiparty democracy mmd mr michael mabenga was there and also demanded that mr sata should be removed immediately and he asked the minister of science and technology to ensure that he mobilize the police to send mr sata off
7768113 in the african tradition that should not be the case because in fact you do not even need an invitation card to attend a funeral procession this was a bit awkward
7768114 the first lady acknowledged this but in her statement she even told mr sata that you reconciled with president mwanawasa but you did not reconcile with me and the family and the family does not want your reconciliation
7768115 there was a time when mr sata accused the first lady of being disrespectful and advised that a marriage counselor should counsel her to teach her how to respect other people recently when the president was in paris in hospital mr sata called on a medical team to go and ascertain his capability of continuing as president that shows the differences that have been there between him and the first lady perhaps the first lady has been harboring that grudge against mr sata
7768116 does he or doesnt he harbor a secret anti terrorist agenda

7768120 in my view the root cause of all our social problems is exclusion we must fight to ensure that a larger number of people everyone if thats possible have access to this wonderful world the world of music the world of the orchestra the world of song the world of art
7768121 sa kutob ko po bilang magulang may gumawa ng di maganda sa anak ko di po gagawin ng anak ko iyan magpakamatay my intuition as a mother says that somebody did something terrible to my daughter my daughter would never commit suicide

7768123 its not normal that seven filipinos would commit suicide in eight months we want the philippine authorities in the uae to find out why they are committing suicide
7768124 we dont know whether they were accidents suicides or foul play
7768125 suicides can happen to anybody regardless of religion and culture its a persons own decision

7768139 yet some economists argue that its harder to dismiss energy and food price gains since they reflect in part global forces that are unlikely to reverse like the industrialization of china and india central banks that target headline inflation like the european central bank and bank of england have maintained much tighter monetary policy than the fed has in the face of the economic slowdown and financial crisis

7768141 in addition to the continued price hikes for energy and fast moving consumer goods expectations of weaker economic development are depressing the consumer mood in particular
7768142 the indicator last scored a comparable low value in summer 2003
7768143 even significantly lower crude oil prices did nothing to brighten the consumer mood

7768148 there were no injuries and minimal damage to the vehicle we are coordinating with pakistani authorities investigating the incident
7768149 as the us side failed to keep its own side of the agreement we cannot but take the following measures under the principle of action for action
7768150 first weve decided to stop the denuclearisation process that has been under way in accordance with the 3 october agreement this measure already took effect on 14 august and relevant parties have already been informed
7768151 second we will consider restoring the yongbyon facilities to their original state in accordance with strong demands from our relevant agencies
7768152 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7768153 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7768154 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7768155 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation

7768164 wir haben es nich gewusst en men heeft ons in de steek gelaten en met een biertje in de hand de polonaise lopen
7768165 wir haben es nich gewusst en men heeft ons in de steek gelaten en met een biertje in de hand de polonaise lopen wanneer deze lafaarden de enclave zelfs tegen een servische overmacht hadden verdedigd was er z ker hulp gekomen en was dit massacre niet geburd daarvan ben ik overtuigd 2duidelijk erg makkelijk om zo vanachter je computer te oordelen volharden in een missie die alleen leidt tot zelfvernietiging is tamelijk zinloos zeker als dit kan leiden tot meer slachtoffers onder de bevolking die je moet beschermen achteraf is makkelijk gezegd dat zij hadden moeten weten dat de servi rs kwamen om de moslims uit te moorden hoewel mijn gevoel ook zegt dat het nooit zover was gekomen als ze hadden gevochten weten we denk ik te weinig om dutchbat zomaar te veroordelen in 1940 capituleerden we ook voor de duitsers waren we toen ook lafaards volharden in een missie die alleen leidt tot zelfvernietiging

7768167 stocks are suffering around the world losing out to bonds and some commodities as investors shy away from equity risk
7768168 yesterdays tokyo rise was the market simply shrugging off all the bad factors its not just lehman that the market is worried about but all of the u s financial system
7768169 as this announcement shows the suffering in connection with fannie and freddie is spreading with other u s banks likely affected as well and possibly even some japanese banks
7768170 at this point it doesnt seem that the package will include anything to promote demand such as tax cuts and the scale appears set to be small
7768171 we are in tune with the global cues but the fall is lower which is a comforting factor the market believes the measures to control inflation are playing out
7768172 in absence of domestic triggers it is highly probable that we may even see a very choppy stock specific action for todays trade nervousness is likely to creep in again
7768173 the deal looks very good from a long term perspective
7768174 it will turbo charge their growth in europe and give them access to a very good set of clients
7768175 the deal is certainly not cheap but its not highly expensive as well given the kind of synergies that infosys will get
7768176 this will give much better returns on the cash they were sitting on for a long time
7768177 axon is a strategic fit for infosys which has been consistently looking to expand its consulting and package implementation capabilities and also its presence in europe

7768179 vhat became of the list that i gave to your bosses im not to have garlic wheat peanuts or crosses
7768180 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7768181 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7768182 this has been a terrible year for e coli outbreaks
7768183 boy scouts at camp were sickened by contaminated hamburger and families who ate at a barbeque restaurant have spent months in icu we expect our food to be free of deadly the job of the regulations put into place by government
7768184 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7768185 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7768186 they don t see she is walking with being and death
7768187 it was blown way out of proportion by a sheriff who wanted his 15 minutes of fame my family is wonderful so very happy were all great
7768188 meanwhile it s ok to blow things up and our films are so violent and our television is so violent
7768189 i would rather see tasteful nudity than violence any day of the week
7768190 i was a mess in some ways and that had nothing to do with my choice of career
7768191 i was the luckiest girl in the world when i got the princess diaries films but all the driven behaviour that you need to be successful as a teenager didn
7768192 if you want to be perfect go sell your possessions and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven
7768193 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7768194 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7768195 i come here as a daughter raised on the south side of chicago by a father who was a blue collar city worker and a mother who stayed at home with my brother and me
7768196 you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7768197 i come here tonight to stand with you and to change america to restore its future and to elect barack obama president of the united states

7768200 its like an ongoing nightmare and no one is sure when were going to wake up
7768201 things are going to get worse before they get better
7768202 these problems going into year end are likely to be worse this time round because of the amount banks have to refinance in december
7768203 the suspicion is that banks are still hiding losses the banking system relies on trust and at the minute there quite simply isnt any
7768204 the trade to do in december will be to get back into the most liquid thing you can find
7768205 we are having a period now of a second round of pressures on banks its weak economic growth which is now piling the pain onto the banks
7768206 happy hearts and happy faces happy play in grassy places that was how in ancient ages children grew to kings and sages
7768207 i believe the nicest and sweetest days are not those on which anything splendid or wonderful or exciting happens but just those that bring simple little pleasures following one another softly like pearls slipping off a string
7768208 i am waiting for you vizzini you told me to go back to the beginning so i have this is where i am and this is where ill stay i will not be moved
7768209 love is like quicksilver in the hand leave the fingers open and it stays clutch it and it darts away
7768210 follow your heart but be quiet for a while first ask questions then feel the answer learn to trust your heart
7768211 its not so much that were afraid of change or so in love with the old ways but its that place in between that we fear its like being between trapezes its linus when his blanket is in the dryer theres nothing to hold on to
7768212 barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7768213 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president

7768216 barack stood up that day and he spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
7768217 she said adding that too often people were forced to settle for the first
7768218 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7768219 all of us driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7768220 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher

7768224 weve had a number of resellers here for a couple of years now as well as a distributor in computerlinks and these partners have secured a number of clients including banks and government
7768225 the changes in compliance and regulatory issues has also helped drive demand for these kinds of products

7768253 ouais moi je lai lu il y a 1 an
7768254 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7768255 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7768256 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7768257 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7768258 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7768259 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7768260 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7768261 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7768262 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7768263 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7768264 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7768265 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7768266 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7768267 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7768268 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas

7768272 tolkede den hebraiske bibel som en del af den kristne kanon
7768273 som en foregribelse af det nye testamente og en profeti om jesus som den forj ttede messias blev de hebraiske skrifter ber vet deres videnskabelige v rdi som kilder til den j diske historie ergo var den autoriserede danske bibelovers ttelse uvidenskabelig og som s dan et produkt af dogmatiske fordomme snarere end l dige forskningsprincipper men forholder det sig virkelig s kategorisk

7768275 only if i could get credit towards my specialist training
7768276 after all these managers grew up and became news directors they would call me from the cities they were in and want me so i started traveling
7768277 i remember the dogs were there sniffing my makeup bag there was myself a producer from 9news and a secret service detail with me the whole time
7768278 im usually not without words but i was completely without words when i saw him and met him
7768279 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7768280 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7768281 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7768282 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7768283 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7768284 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7768285 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7768286 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7768287 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7768288 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7768289 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7768290 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7768291 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7768292 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7768293 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7768294 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7768295 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7768296 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7768297 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7768298 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7768299 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7768300 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7768301 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7768302 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7768303 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7768304 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7768305 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7768306 who are open to doing something on the production side
7768307 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7768308 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7768309 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7768310 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7768311 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7768312 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7768313 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7768314 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7768315 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7768316 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7768317 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7768318 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7768319 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7768320 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7768321 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7768322 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7768323 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7768324 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7768325 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7768326 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7768327 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7768328 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7768329 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7768330 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7768331 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7768332 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
7768333 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

7768346 it just seems to me that edwards might be attracted to a woman whose mouth did something other than talk my theory that i just explained to you about why you know what could have john edwards motivations been to have the affair with rielle hunter given his wife is smarter than he is and probably nagging him a lot about doing this and he found somebody that did something with her mouth other than talk
7768347 i think everyone can understand why for the sake of our family that elizabeth and i wanted to keep this a private matter however now that we realize the situation has entered the public domain we want to be as honest and open as we can in 2006 i had an affair with rielle hunter it did happen although i am not the father of her child after the affair concluded i confessed to my wife what i had done and she chose that we work the difficult time together the affair was a mistake it was destructive to my family and to myself and i have no excuses i can only say that i am sorry and ask your forgiveness for betraying your trust in me

7768351 there is no crisis except the one being manufactured by harper
7768352 weve never been told there was a time limit for this meeting other than it was to happen before the house reconvened as it was meant to be about this sitting of parliament
7768353 this is an invention by mr harper to try to trigger an election before he loses the by elections
7768354 this is full improvisation and it shows panic from the prime minister
7768355 itll be straightforward and the bill will not be open to misinterpretation

7768362 the bottom line is the opportunity to increase the tax base and expand the footprint of downtown
7768363 we need downtown to be more than elm street that was the goal
7768364 we propose an investment strategy that does for church street what has been done so successfully for elm
7768365 the aim should be that in five to 10 years the name church street should be synonymous with arts culture and entertainment
7768366 assuming church street could achieve the status of elm there is opportunity for 10 13 million in additional property taxes along church street over the next 30 years
7768367 real but disconnected with no critical mass in any one location
7768368 it is critical that the civil rights museum downtowns most important new cultural asset be completed
7768369 making public funds available to accomplish this merits very serious consideration
7768370 i think its definitely a crucial game for both programs but thats because every first game of the season is important
7768371 weve been preparing for utah state the entire offseason ive always said that its kind of like the olympics you get a lot of time to prepare for that first opponent and we wanted to take advantage of that time and prepare the right way
7768372 but i was excited about the chance to become a head coach ive been preparing for that opportunity my entire life and i was excited to be a head coach when i got the chance i would do the same thing all over again

7768380 we have information about death of three persons in raikia area the details are being collected
7768381 the situation in kandhamal district is very tense but under control
7768382 the vehicles collided with each other and the truck that hit the humvee took off and the humvee followed
7768383 the lapd officer was trying to detain the guy because of the hit and run
7768384 he was giving him some verbal commands obviously the guy wasnt complying with it and thats when the officer involved shooting occurred
7768385 at some point there will be determinations as to whether its justifiable or not
7768386 we are in a meeting to decide on whether to come out withit or not if we decide to issue it it will be 500 to 1 000crores 5 billion to 10 billion rupees

7768393 a number of nurses have been sacked from al mafraq hospital this has been done on the basis of certain written tests that were conducted earlier this year

7768395 not only are individual economies better prepared to weather a sudden stop of capital flows but the risk of financial contagion in the region may have decreased as a result of the reserve accumulation
7768396 by 2020 we might have nine billion people on the planet we could have a very big middle class driving millions more cars and we could be in a really resource hungry world with the oil price climbing and a supply situation in libya russia and saudi where natural gas is limited
7768397 it is those drivers those conditions which will encourage the possibility of landfill mining
7768398 once plastic is in a landfill site it pretty much sits there doing nothing and the beauty of that is that youre able to go back and recapture it in the future
7768399 there are some really buoyant prices around because plastic is all manufactured from oil so as the raw price of oil goes up every commodity derived from it goes up accordingly
7768400 over a period of a very long time many decades we have had a policy of burying whatever we can in landfill sites so there are valuable resources in those sites
7768401 and wherever there are valuable resources there is always the temptation to investigate whether its worth recovering them the logic is sound but the practicalities are complex and you have to balance those out with the commercial viability
7768402 several pilot studies have been carried out for research or pre feasibility studies in countries in europe but also in china japan and india
7768403 for example landfills in sweden dating from the 1960s have a lot of waste building material reflecting the construction boom of that era
7768404 and other landfills have very specific waste like those used by vehicle breakers which have high concentrations of aluminium copper and iron scrap
7768405 the value of these materials varies daily with global market prices and today there is considerable demand for scrap metal from china for instance
7768406 just imagine the resources that are lying in those landfills it could be incredible

7768413 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

7768415 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7768416 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7768417 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7768418 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7768419 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7768420 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7768421 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7768422 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7768423 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7768424 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7768425 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7768428 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7768429 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7768430 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7768431 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7768432 traditionally cultural awareness training was a brief introduction to the language culture customs and food this training while providing basic instruction in these areas did not provide the operational relevance required to conduct counterinsurgency warfare
7768433 it is vital that soldiers have the training to understand the people whom they will assist and those that will pose a grave and present danger
7768434 deeply rooted ideologies mindsets codes and sensitivities that form the impetus for potential enemies
7768435 its in a stalemate now and people are looking for ways to gain the advantage it might make us slightly more effective but it wont turn the battlefield
7768436 we continue to have the same goal which is to reach agreement by the end of the year
7768437 we have a lot of work ahead to do that and obviously its a complicated time but its always complicated out here
7768438 construction in the settlements has increased by a factor of 1 8 by comparison to the same period last year

7768446 the excitement surrounding the sport of swimming is undoubtedly at an all time high
7768447 we absolutely expect that this sort of excitement and exposure will translate to membership growth at our clubs across the nation the performances by our olympic athletes were awe inspiring and nbc did a wonderful job of sharing those performances with a national audience we are confident that those factors will inspire thousands to take up the sport
7768448 we have been hearing from our member clubs across the country since the completion of swimming in beijing and they are seeing the effects already
7768449 the clubs we have spoken with tell us that their phones have been busy all month and that trend is being mirrored across the country
7768450 we knew we set some high goals but after seeing the numbers at our try outs weve got a real good shot at the 25 30 mark
7768451 we held our try outs at the beginning of a tropical storm and we still had record numbers i think its not just what michael phelps did but all of the publicity and coverage that the sport got and the positive image that the swimmers projected that are sparking so much interest
7768452 we came back from vacation and i had more than 30 voicemail messages
7768453 i was kind of surprised since we havent even started our recruiting campaign were going to have to try to make room for all these new swimmers
7768454 as a coach for the spokane area swimming team for the last 20 years and also an employee of the ymca of the inland northwest ive seen first hand the impact the olympics have had on interest in competitive swimming michael phelps performance has kids excited about swimming competitively but ive also noticed that adults are swimming and exercising more it seems that dara torres philosophy of age is just a number is inspiring many adults to train and get in shape at any age

7768553 problems facing bangladesh and south asia are global issues which must be addressed at regional scale through co operation information exchange joint ventures and mutual support
7768554 carbon sequestration in soils terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is a win win strategy for reversing degradation trends an effective pilot programme to adapt and mitigate the effects of climate change in south asia can be a role model for similar initiatives elsewhere in the developing countries
7768555 the main determinant of agricultural production in south asia is still the seasonal variation of precipitation and temperature
7768556 droughts floods frost freezes and heatwaves stress both crops and livestock
7768557 it would be useful to establish a climate change information network for south asia that would provide the means to share and communicate information data and science on

7768561 climate change is a development challenge that requires a holistic approach encompassing all ministries sectors as well as civil society organizations and the private sector

7768574 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7768575 something he never had the affirming embrace of a fathers love
7768576 those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7768577 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for a world as it should be and that is the thread that connects our hearts
7768578 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbably journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope

7768582 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender of group against group and of straight against gay
7768583 and barack obama will be a commander in chief who understands that young americans in uniform must never be committed to a mistake but always to a mission worthy of their bravery
7768584 this is what we do we reach the moon we scale the heights i know it ive seen it ive lived it and we can do it again

7768594 the one in b c is still a little bit controversial
7768595 its very very very easy for someone to convince you to go through their computer

7768607 as one of the countrys most profitable investment sources the real estate sector is attracting the attention of investors from all over the globe due in large part to the composed projects and environment that the market provides for investment
7768608 as a result bank funding for the real estate market alone in 2007 amounted to 45 billion dirhams 12 25 billion of a total of 75 billion dirhams 20 4 billion allocated for the construction sector
7768609 part of the reason behind this is that due to the high level of growth in the region the demand for workers is at an all time high and because of this there is no shortage of jobs in the country and packages are generous so as to attract and keep workers within the uae based companies

7768629 but it only makes us stronger i am not going to sit down and give up
7768630 were just glad to have all the kids back and were just excited about another successful school year here in rockingham county
7768631 they tend to do better when they take responsibility for themselves

7768634 her story really does in many ways reflect the problem a lot of north carolinians have faced over the last eight years
7768635 im trying to get my nerves calmed down now that im here
7768636 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7768637 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7768653 brett carroll was a hard working decent australian he lost his life in a workplace accident that should never have happened
7768654 sit around and do nothing during breaks because they dont like other sports
7768655 reviewing the decision and the minister has given his support for that
7768656 obviously theres been quite a bit of community backlash against the decision so the minister just asked for them to have another look and see if thats what they really want to do the spokeswoman said
7768657 it was just one principals decision and theres no state wide directive that cartwheels are banned in all queensland schools or anything like that
7768658 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads
7768659 hes not anti black absolutely not hes not in any way shape or form a racist
7768660 leaders of the region have arrived at the scene and they are handling the accident
7768661 any information related to the accident will be released by the guangxi government
7768662 if daw aung san suu kyi continues to refuse food from her comrades her health will be of serious concern
7768663 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7768664 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7768665 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7768666 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7768667 when i got there the cows that were walking towards me were just dropping into the river that was the most horrific sight i have ever seen
7768668 more like a highway bridge than a dairy farm bridge
7768669 seeing your favourite cows being washed down the river was like losing a pet dog
7768670 i couldnt believe the amount of water that was flowing
7768671 the worst thing was the one staff member to get the cows in this morning was the one with the biggest passion for cows weve ever had here he was stuffed
7768672 i want to read about children the things that happen to them and the things they do those novels of adult concerns you know the ones everyone reads about disloyalties and excess i cant find the heart in them they all seem so much the same so empty as if marriage and its end were the most important events of life really so i like to read about children not childrens books mind you you do know what i mean
7768673 yes exactly thats just what i mean only there werent any girls in that story which may be why it turned out so savagely
7768674 funny ive always heard that girls are more ruthless than boys
7768675 i didnt say they werent ruthless i said the boys were more savage
7768676 do you think you could find me some books like that don
7768677 i dont think we have anything like that in the library
7768678 i hope you dont mind i heat the water in the microwave but ill put the tea in loose do you still cook
7768679 i didnt really call to ask you about books but its not that i dont want
7768680 you see theres a mystery here and id like you to help me solve it
7768681 i feel i can trust you don from the first i saw you there was something a certain something discretion perhaps a man who keeps to himself
7768682 i dont need a fairy i need a sleuth wait here
7768683 this was made originally for maps and pictures in a museum storage they were throwing it out because the drawers stuck i had it refitted see
7768684 marvel from next door mother to cammy she always called him cammy the murdered man we grew up together in toledo went to the same high school
7768685 i didnt know her that well her family had more money than mine thats why i was surprised when she asked me to be a bridesmaid in her wedding this was after the war july 1947 look at those suits same as todays even the dresses dont look too dated but youd never catch a bridesmaid wearing something like that on her head now would you
7768686 of course they were fashioned at a millenary and the very peak of fashionable copied from somewhere i dont recall its tulle you see stretched over wire and connected to the little froth there on the crown we thought they were angelic
7768687 the way it frames your you isnt it it looks like ears
7768688 i thought the same thing when i looked at this photo last week i look like a sheep exactly like a sheep and not even lamb mind you
7768689 this one may her ears are like a bears but marvel
7768690 yes she said they met in missouri she was working in an airplane factory in i believe saint louis maybe he was from there originally i dont know i never met any of his family and after the wedding they left for overseas the philippines
7768691 it was time ago and such a busy happy time
7768692 marvels wedding was a surprise but there were so many weddings and its hard now to separate them in my mind even from my own one dinner was so much like another and many of the participants the same
7768693 six years ago marvel called me ill never know how she found me dick was still alive then but it was his last year and she wanted to know about the homes
7768694 the homes well it wasnt more than a couple of months and they moved here but harry he went poorly immediately and they both ended up assisted living the apartment next door
7768695 and after dick died i had to move to assisted as well more tea
7768696 i think theres a secret a treasure i think its a treasure marvel was always something timid even as a girl just like her mother and her father i remember him as severe harry was something like that too and when he died it was like the supports went out of her its not that we were so close anyway because dick was sick too and all but she wouldnt even talk to me after after until one day poof she was changed like a different person completely not at all like herself talking and talking and shed rub her hands together like this i think she addled
7768697 so i was saying she changed talk talk talk and so restless she had a box she kept it on top of the tv she was forever showing me that box and whispering that inside was the key sometimes she called it a map once imagine she said there was a door inside inside the box and to open it would blind her with the treasure of kings what i want to know is wheres the box
7768698 its rhetorical i know rather i presume you dont know where the box is and in fact have never seen it
7768699 thats the thing i think the box was stolen i think that marvels son and daughter in law were killed for that box
7768700 how do you know the box isnt still in there
7768701 wouldnt it have been a lot easier to kill marvel why wait until she was dead
7768702 i was hoping you could help me find out like i said i need a sleuth
7768703 how about houston havent you always wanted to go to houston
7768704 you know new orleans isnt what it used to be
7768705 yes it is the part i want to go to anyway they fixed it up first thing for tourists
7768706 i want to be a tourist i never been a tourist before
7768707 itd be just the two of us in new orleans just two tourists hey we could be me and you on a honeymoon cmon sweetie pretty please

7768713 of course i know theres a map under your seat if you want to look
7768714 it looks like theres only one road and it goes south
7768715 the mexicans at least they can go the other way
7768716 youre my honey baby you know that ill always stick to you
7768717 athletic prowess does not always seem to translate into great coaching ability but in whitneys case it does
7768718 she comes up with some of the most interesting and fun workouts i have ever done and they somehow never seem to repeat i think her coaching is one of the reasons we have such a great team
7768719 our masters workouts usually have 10 lanes in a 25 yard pool or five in a 50 meter pool and the pace varies by lane from moderate to fast to very fast
7768720 im not a great workout swimmer but i usually have my best workouts when someone is pushing me so my teammates have definitely helped make me faster
7768721 one of the most enjoyable aspects for me has been helping other people get better
7768722 ive had a few people come back to me later and say
7768723 she had the box of garbage bags in her hand
7768724 she was cleaning out the drawer in the bedroom already filled up the wastebasket from the bath
7768725 was it her mother the old lady who lived here
7768726 my mother in law gets red handed with a thug in her living room and she wont look so the angel
7768727 when does your mother in law ever look like an angel
7768728 camilo evart son of marvel and harry evart fifty seven years old 22476 old bridge drive cleveland ohio looks a lot scrappier than you dont he
7768729 the guy blew his heart out hed never last a minute
7768730 youd have to do that first or he wouldve turned around
7768731 dont know jefa nada out of place that i can see dead guys wallets in his pocket ladys purse is on the counter there
7768732 havent touched a thing jefa cept for the volume on the tv
7768733 the killer calculated and planned perhaps the deaths themselves were the object whats the bedroom look like
7768734 all right go see what you can get from the people in charge around here send the photographer in get the names back to the station camilo is that italian
7768735 his mama mustve picked it no son of mined get hung with a girlie name like that
7768736 have the folks outside gone to lunch then do it shut the door when you leave
7768737 i want forensics on these keys and the door here what did you find out
7768738 camilo and alice johnson phoenix hes retired insurance owned his own place in ohio parents harry and marvel moved here three years ago harry died about six months later marvel died last week
7768739 listen coughy was promoted last year after the shell murder mystery a triple homicide involving a group of teens outside the gas station a local police officer stan morrissey was later arrested and charged as an accessory now why do they always have to be bringing that up what has it to do with the present case nada thats right nada theyre just going under your skin you with me jefa
7768740 i got the male vics old mans obit harry johnson had an international company that insured old cars
7768741 hey timo did you look through that catalog of christmas presents yet
7768742 remember i gave you that book and said you could circle the things you wanted
7768743 maybe we could look at it together over there on the couch
7768744 oh you better watch out and you better not cry and you better not pout im telling you why santa claus is coming to town
7768745 will i get some of some things and some of nothing
7768746 i think we are going to hear that theme again loudly clearly and in a heartfelt way
7768747 the promise of america is that all of us will have access to opportunity and i want to run a 2008 campaign that renews that promise a campaign built on a lifetime record of results
7768748 on this january night at this defining moment in history you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
7768749 i understand that a lot of people are asking what does hillary want what does she want well i want what i have always fought for in this whole campaign
7768750 i want to end the war in iraq i want to turn this economy around i want health care for every american i want every child to live up to his or her god given potential and i want the nearly 18 million americans who voted for me to be respected to be heard and no longer to be invisible
7768751 while i traveled our country talking about how i wanted to help you time and again you reached out to help me to grab my hand or grip my arm to look into my eyes and tell me dont quit keep fighting stay in this race for us
7768752 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7768753 dont be fooled into thinking this means its one big happy family working together in concert theres still to my mind a surprisingly large amount of negative feelings on both sides with these two camps
7768754 when it comes to finishing the fight rocky and i have a lot in common i never quit
7768755 youre going off in a direction the olympics dont go
7768756 we chose athletes it didnt matter what language they spoke what religion they were what colour they were
7768757 apparently weve moved past racism in america but we havent moved past sexism
7768758 i am hillary clinton and i do not approve that message
7768759 the fact is that our teams are working closely to ensure a successful convention
7768760 anyone saying anything else doesnt know what theyre talking about period
7768761 by rule as a delegate i must support the nominee im going to follow the rule
7768762 i wont get to cast my vote my state wont reflect what the vote was that would be very unfortunate if you are going to disenfranchise half of the people at the convention its going to be very hard to find unity
7768763 the largest portion of it is media spin and groups that have no association with her campaign
7768764 theyre groups that are more into making a statement about themselves rather than about the democratic party or senator clinton
7768765 were going to see a rousing speech from her she can give such a great speech its going to bring the convention together and its going to be a united convention
7768766 los etarras viven mal y no son cobardes simplemente est n acosados

7768770 de hecho este es el testimonio mayoritario de los heridos que se encuentran en un estado consciente
7768771 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum

7768795 in fact they are the only ones capable of making it a success
7768796 certainly it will mean sacrifice and possibly a prolonged absence from your families

7768800 registered democrats in michigan and georgia who believe that the federal minimum wage needs to be increased and that global warming is being inadequately addressed are perfectly suited for such a selfless venture
7768801 i am delighted that in this arduous midterm election season the white house is finally reaching across the aisle to these fine vigilant individuals
7768802 despite our differences i know the democrats of my home state are the kinds of folks the president is talking about strong devoted caring people who support stem cell research and stronger gun laws
7768803 the beijing olympics have been a spectacular sporting event but they took place against a backdrop of human rights violations with activists prevented from expressing their views peacefully and many in detention when they have committed no crime
7768804 the chinese authorities and the ioc had an opportunity to demonstrate human rights improvements but in most respects they failed to deliver forced evictions detention of activists and restrictions on journalists should not blight another olympics
7768805 it is high time for the ioc to put its core values of human dignity and universal fundamental ethical principles into practice by making human rights a new pillar of the olympic games

7768812 i think all of us kind of changed when maestro walked into the building
7768813 i used to notice that he would be gone for a few weeks and he would come back and suddenly at the first rehearsal he was back i would look around and suddenly everyone was dressed much better
7768814 let us sacrifice one day for the people who have sacrificed so much for the community
7768815 it does not make sense for a special branch member to be detained under the isa the rumours have been around since the day he was arrested this is nonsense
7768816 i dont know why waytha moorthy is making such allegations it is only causing friction among the detained leaders which would lead to the destruction of the movement
7768817 waytha moorthy wanted to call off the rally but it was my husband who insisted it go on from then there was bad blood between the two
7768818 he ran away and allowed other hindraf leaders to languish in jail
7768819 if he is going to accuse my husband of anything i challenge him to come back here and do it not from a foreign land

7768840 oh hey did you write up a speech in case you win
7768841 oh heck no im up against the ugly betty head writer
7768842 the defamatory words were repeated in an article written by the journalist edited by wong and published by the star
7768843 its definitely the best move footy wise i could have made
7768844 im loving my time here and looking forward to another two years
7768845 the first year i dealt with a bit of homesickness and missing family and friends as anyone would when you change your job and your state
7768846 but from then on ive really built some momentum in my footy and also the way that ive handled things off the field so im very settled here in melbourne
7768847 if someone said a couple of years ago youre going to win a best and fairest or be in the mix i would have thought id made the transition back to wafl footy pretty well
7768848 the position were in at the moment and with a young side i think momentums really important going into the finals
7768849 to win a fourth game straight possibly is going to be a big spur on to do well in the finals and give us a lot of confidence
7768850 anyone thats up to speed on the dynamics of the trade that went through i didnt really have a whole heap of say in what went on so if people sort of bear that in mind i think theyll go easy on me
7768851 i still believe its an advantage if you know how to win a u s open
7768852 its a tough tournament to win rafa has never been beyond the quarters so thats definitely the advantage i carry to the other players
7768853 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7768854 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7768855 who the f ck are supergrass who the f ck are supergrass
7768856 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7768857 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7768858 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7768859 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7768860 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7768861 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7768862 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7768863 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7768864 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7768865 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7768866 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7768867 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7768868 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7768869 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7768870 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7768871 if he or she truly loved me they would know what i need without my having to say it with so many words
7768872 this isnt what i would have thought or done how could you
7768873 ill take care of you as soon as i give daddy what he needs
7768874 hey my spouse just walked in i have to go ill call you later
7768875 my grandmother used to say if intimacy leaves the marriage it will go somewhere else
7768876 i know there are activities out there but im too lazy to find them can you do it for me
7768877 im sorry i didnt get a chance to write before im having a great time
7768878 i want as much time as i can get with the guys and now im limited with their two situations
7768879 were going to do everything we can to get ready whatever it takes
7768880 if we dont have a full game plan in because were not comfortable with some of the stuff that theyd normally run had they had a full offseason to work out and get ready then well go with a smaller game plan and figure out what works best for us
7768881 if there is no peace then it is because weve forgotten that we belong to each other
7768882 well just have to wait and see what happens with that
7768883 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7768884 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7768885 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7768886 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7768887 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7768888 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7768889 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7768890 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7768891 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7768892 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7768893 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7768894 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7768895 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7768896 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7768897 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7768898 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7768899 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7768900 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7768901 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7768902 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7768903 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7768904 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7768905 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7768906 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7768907 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7768908 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7768909 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7768910 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7768911 oh my god cammy come here you gotta see this panty liners the whole drawers full of panty liners
7768912 cammy look at this panty liners can you you believe it
7768913 no theyre panty liners you mothers top drawer is stuffed with them its so sad its like a tragedy
7768914 shed just die if she knew i was pawing through her private parts
7768915 yes i know but imagine if it was me or you whats in your top drawer

7768917 no one serves corned beef no more you know that
7768918 but i saw a place on florida on the way to the pharmacy they had a sign on the window

7768920 we need to help these countries develop sophisticated air defence and anti tank capabilities that dont pose any offensive threat to russia but promise the possibility of very high casualties were they to attempt what they did in georgia
7768921 nato has to make a fundamental decision here about its legal and ethical obligations and the only way we can really fulfil them is to help these countries defend themselves in advance of an attack
7768922 i favor the pristine and classic all u s stock market and all bond market approach
7768923 many pensions belong to working class people without other savings who will be counting pennies in their retirement for these people keeping up with the price of eggs is very important and investing in equities over the past decade has turned out to be a pretty gruesome decision im not sure if its possible for a pension fund to benchmark a food basket but there are lots of fund managers out there who are responsible for the life savings and wellbeing of people who are going to spend their retirements living on low incomes such managers might well want to start spending less time looking at absolute returns and more time keeping an eye on the cost of living and how it might be hedged
7768924 the three factor model is as fama and french have repeatedly emphasized only a model it is not reality
7768925 i never attempt to make money on the stock market i buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years
7768926 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market
7768927 unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50 without becoming panic stricken you should not be in the stock market

7768962 he has absolutely no doubt that this will be the case
7768963 me and dontay are speed guys coming off the edge
7768964 im much more comfortable ive only played defensive end and running back
7768965 we get off the ball very similar and a lot of times in practice we get there at the same time well share some stats im sure
7768966 i went into this season trying to make my presence known
7768967 i love the 4 3 the only bad thing is that i cant drop back in coverage and get a couple of interceptions
7768968 the key thing is proving to be game worthy the real key will be how they pick up the ball and play during the season hopefully they can play like they have been in practice and scrimmages
7768969 they have to do blue collar work too youve got to be able to hem an offense in if the offense runs the ball well all of the time you are not hemming them in if you dont
7768970 i hate seven or eight small meals a day i was working out two or three times a day plus ive been able to keep my speed up i spent a lot of time in the weight room since last season and its paid off
7768971 last year he moch was kind of timid and shied away from contact
7768972 he was a pass rush specialist and did a nice job
7768973 he really gained in the weightroom hes just a different guy hes a confident guy when you ask him to shoot between the tackle and guard he feels really confident
7768974 he basped actually played better under a tight end than he did in space last year
7768975 i can create a play more often now being outside
7768976 i dont have to sit back and read as much as last year im looking forward to the challenge i want to be a complete player not just somebody that comes into the game depending on the situation
7768977 he basped is what i like to call a sunday guy

7769053 when i got there the cows that were walking towards me were just dropping into the river that was the most horrific sight i have ever seen
7769054 more like a highway bridge than a dairy farm bridge
7769055 seeing your favourite cows being washed down the river was like losing a pet dog
7769056 i couldnt believe the amount of water that was flowing

7769069 it is simply shocking that only 33 percent or less of americans reports having a great deal or quite a lot of trust in 11 of 15 industries measured in the survey
7769070 and these trust levels are 14 percent less than they were last fall when we started taking these measurements this trend should be a call to action for businesses especially in an ailing economy the link between consumer trust and profitability is well established
7769071 the decline in consumer trust can have really negative consequences for businesses but interestingly it presents a clear opportunity for competitive advantage for businesses that embrace consumer demand for trust in the marketplace
7769072 most importantly we will strengthen our members we will work as the middle man who not only controls the advantageous neatness and clearness of the signals transmitted to cable tv members but also overseas subscriber fees or service fees that have to be fair to customers we will also encourage our cable tv media to create more regional contents such as news or any movements that happens in local areas this aims to send communications from local to central we believe that such contents besides being local operators strong point will also be a selling point to customers who need useful information or want to see what is happening in their local areas in addition they will play a key role in all pr and image developments for small and medium enterprises or smes who have no power in purchasing free tv commercials
7769073 for years many a thinking people have had gloomy forebodings as to the result of the immense power of the church in our political affairs and the first step in the disestablishment of the church amp of all churches is the taxation of church property the government has no right to tax infidels for everything that takes the name of religion for every dollar of church property untaxed all other properties must be taxed one dollar more and thus the poor mans home bears the burden of maintaining costly edifices from which he amp his family are as effectively excluded as though a policeman stood to bar their entrance and in smaller towns all sects are building building building not a little town in the western prairies but has its three amp four churches amp this immense accumulation of wealth is all exempt from taxation in the new world as well as the old these rich ecclesiastical corporations are a heavy load on the shoulders of the people for what wealth escapes the laboring masses are compelled to meet if all the church property in this country were taxed in the same ratio poor widows are to day we could soon roll off the national debt the clergy of all sects are universally opposed to free thought amp free speech amp if they had the power even in our republic to day would crush any man who dared to question the popular religion

7769078 we will regulate some aspects such as gaseous composition of the atmosphere through our intelligence
7769079 each of us is born on a line from the moment of conception to the moment of our death we are all on a lifeline the passage from one point to the next is filled with experiences and interactions and each of us will express our true spirit as these moments present themselves good or bad the moments will come the journey is one of progression it is contemplation of the future we are all searching for something traveling toward our dreams what exists now is really all that ever exists we cannot feel the past of a thousand years nor can we touch the lifeline of tomorrow we dance me or sing you to the music of here and now we sing the songs of today we have an understanding about who we are and what is ours to fulfill let the winds of change blow all around you and follow your lifeline wherever it may lead knowing that others are pursuing their fate on different pathways leading them in different directions each and every one of us will find a true sense of purpose if we travel our own roads on our own lifeline

7769088 america stands at a crossroads with an historic choice between two paths
7769089 one is a path of renewing opportunity and promoting innovation here at home and of greater security and respect around the world but there is another path it leads us to the same broken promises and failed policies that have diminished the american dream and weakened the security of our nation
7769090 we call this convention to order tonight to put america on the path begun by our founders a path that renews americas promise for a new century
7769091 after years of inaction by republicans in our very first act we passed the 9 11 commission recommendations to protect the american people that was just the beginning
7769092 legislation to keep hard working american families in their homes
7769093 we helped rebuild the gulf coast for the survivors of hurricanes katrina and rita we put recovery rebates into the hands of more than 130 million families
7769094 america needs a president who knows our democracy depends on a strong middle class and who will create millions of good paying jobs right here at home
7769095 democrats know we cant afford any more of the same failed republican path

7769116 that is just a monumental moment in the journey of african americans
7769117 obama will give a great speech as has been his trademark
7769118 the press will sing his praises and remark on his historic address and obamas place in history
7769119 i think this will provide him a forum to show exactly who he is
7769120 all of the attack ads and talking heads on tv will be set aside for a moment theyll understand that he is not a person of privilege that he grew up in tough circumstances once friday morning rolls around i think theyll be impressed
7769121 glad he got his job back for this incident try to give a kid a break using his discretion and this is what he gets
7769122 seems pretty logical to me considering all the bs he would have to do just to take a kid to jail for possession of one baggie

7769134 theres been some concerns in the community around the atlantis nightclub and clubs along richards street in the past i can tell you that theres not a disproportionate number of complaints that are coming in around atlantis we have seen fewer calls for service to that club in the past year i know that theyve been working to improve some of their security measures and situation within the bar

7769164 the pick says something profound about obama for all his self confidence he is worried that he couldnt beat rep john mccain without help from a seasoned politician willing to attack
7769165 unfounded prejudice of not being american enough which plays into the fear that he cant be trusted
7769166 obama is about change he changes positions to win elections

7769497 earthworms help ragweed thrive by systematically collecting and burying its seeds in their burrows
7769498 in fact weve found that more than two thirds of all giant ragweed seedlings emerge from earthworm burrows
7769499 our study shows that nightcrawlers are some of natures most effective weed farmers
7769500 they actively forage for weed seeds pull them into their burrows and then plant them under up to several inches of soil
7769501 we found the worms collect and bury 10 types of seeds in the same size range
7769502 but they have three special favorites giant ragweed bur cucumber sicyos angulatus and sunflower helianthus annuus
7769503 research that helps us understand the accumulation of weed seeds in the soil and how weeds are spread is critical to the development of new effective management strategies
7769504 giant ragweed should be vigorously controlled in fields and gardens in order to minimize further seed production and protect plant growth and crop yields

7769512 the strategic alliance between vargo consultants and plexis provides state government healthcare organizations with the opportunity to capitalize on proven commercial success
7769513 there is an evolution taking place in the government market today states are much more interested in what solutions and products are working successfully for commercial healthcare organizations than ever before
7769514 by identifying flexible highly configurable solutions to integrate with and to support existing state and federal programs we can significantly trim down development and implementation costs thus allowing a larger portion of the program dollars to be spent directly on the members healthcare needs
7769515 solutions need to be scalable highly configurable and most importantly offered at a substantially lower cost than current offerings
7769516 after spending the past 15 years working closely with and listening to state medicaid program directors ask repeatedly for product based solutions and only have project based deployment solutions available to them its clear that the states want and need new options
7769517 there is a direct correlation between implementing best practices for managing client files and reducing the amount of consumables used in a law office

7769551 hopefully i can turn things around in the one day series and get some big runs
7769552 the whole tour i have never felt badly out of form i have got a few good nuts along the way and a couple of balls i didnt see which is an interesting combination
7769553 i am not out of nick so there is no reason i cant get some big runs again
7769554 we feel that for sure but we have to come out and not worry about the opposition but our game
7769555 that has been our strength over the last two years and if we play the kind of cricket we know we can there is no reason we cant turn it around
7769556 from a team point of view it was the worst display we have had for probably two years
7769557 we have had some time to sit down and reflect and get into the nets to practice but it is more of a mental change than a skills type of thing
7769558 the guys will come out and you will see a different side we arrived at the game and played it without really thinking about it you cant do that at this level
7769559 certainly not to the standard we have played over the last two years you cant perform against top sides in the world at 65 70
7769560 without naming names i do want to make the point that the 2003 world cup coaching team effectively left no legacy to the english game
7769561 as a result the elite end of the sport in this country was in a terrible state
7769562 i thought it was too much of a coincidence that i scored a hundred against west indies just before i got the captaincy last year and i scored another hundred the day after i gave it up
7769563 it was very much a relief i spoke to my wife on the thursday night and said i couldnt keep going like that because i was going to lose my test spot and thats going to hurt the most
7769564 its always been the thing ive wanted most in cricket to cement my test spot and i didnt want to give that away easily
7769565 ill be honest and admit the run out situation didnt help thats something that doesnt go away overnight
7769566 even though you turn around and apologise youve still got people questioning you and that hurt me quite a lot
7769567 but ive grown up all my life wanting to play cricket for england and contributing to england and it was getting to the point i was going to lose my test place i thought something has got to give here because i cant keep going like this
7769568 when i got the captaincy i said i never had massive ambitions to do the job but i thought it was a great time to take a new challenge on
7769569 ive always just wanted to be a player always wanted to play for england and i still think you can be a leader in the ranks as well ill just go back to doing that

7769607 i chose the superior sawtooth 100 mile ultramarathon because of the races reputation within the ultrarunning community
7769608 the mountains are not as tall as some of the west coast races but the terrain is comprised of constant climbing and descending a total of 20 000 feet in total on top of very technical and difficult terrain add in the experience of being engulfed in scenery of unparalleled fall beauty and its hard to imagine a better place to spend thirty hours
7769609 i have trained extensively for this race and my mental emotional and physical states have never been stronger
7769610 situations like running through the lonely periods at night deep in the dark woods will definitely be a challenge but i am confident that i will keep pushing forward one foot in front of the other until i have finished the hundred miles

7769704 thanks for another really fab and inspiring call i get so much out of your coaching its fabulous
7769705 i would like to echo what d said about the abundant coach programme the group has and is really supportive but then are we surprised when it was marion who set the group up
7769706 id just like to say how much im appreciating the triads have only taken part in 2 but have found them extremely helpful whether being coached receiving feedback on my coaching or just observing other peoples styles its been great thank you
7769707 it is apparent from tonights call that weve all achieved more than we thought ourselves capable of i am honoured to be a part of such an inspiring and talented group of real women living real lives with all the challenges involved and still managing to take the necessary steps to move forward on our journey
7769708 the synergy and support in this group is truly abundant and i feel privileged to have shared this exquisite experience
7769709 it is great having feedback but what is great that marion has created a forum where we are all interested and supportive of each other this matters a lot in my mind that fact that we all pool together
7769710 i have to say reading what everyone is accomplishing is brilliant everyones doing fabulously well great course marion
7769711 all this activity is due to my call with marion yesterday im in good form and speeding along
7769712 i enjoyed the support of the group and the fact i could identify strongly with most of them
7769713 i realise how lucky i was to have a great call with you yesterday marion thanks for all your invaluable help
7769714 just wanted to let you know that as a result of tonights call i have a new client and she has already paid for this months sessions
7769715 thanks marion as i said i couldnt have got so far on my own without your help you have been a brick and i do hear voices in my head yours and they make so much sense
7769716 i want to say a big thank you for your generosity being on the programme has made a huge difference to me i wouldnt have achieved as much without the encouragement and support of all of you thank you for believing in me and for making it possible
7769717 marion said once you have done it it gets easier and not so frightening once again she was right
7769718 i have just had my fix of patrick swayze and dirty dancing the time of my life anyway i seem to have solved the problem of you know what i think it is with us all marion you gave us faith in ourselves so we believe we can do everything we set out minds to bless you
7769719 all the women on the forum are really great and what action everyone has taken thanks to you x has literally grown into a concorde y has developed her business almost from scratch as have a number of others im impressed that z has developed her blog so effectively
7769720 i now have all the tools and i just have to apply them loads to do and im feeling very inspired and motivated
7769721 ps do you charge commission for the inspiration you bring to me amp others you should
7769722 marion is a shining example of coaching best practice she offers challenge intuition and grounded support and knows exactly when each is needed its not always easy coaching a coach and she succeeds with wit and wisdom ive had a least one major breakthrough in my thinking as a result of her empathic insight and im sure there will be many more to come
7769723 marion is quite simply the best coaching experience of the many i have had as a coach myself i know what the process is supposed to be like and when i have just simply not had the 5 star session i expected her warm modest and engaging personality puts me immediately at my ease
7769724 the course was excellent interesting informative and extremely supportive the one to one sessions with marion were fantastic not only did they provide me with the motivating and constructive push that i definitely needed they gave me the opportunity to feel the true benefit of being coached marion is fun generous with her experience and a very safe pair of hands i end the course feeling well and truly on the right track i am fully equipped to market my life coaching business and am now completely confident in my style of coaching thank you marion
7769725 the abundant coach has given me many aha moments helping me identify not only where my passions are but also how to create a profitable business that i love with the support of the programme ive managed to break through many fear barriers i came looking for business focus and structure what i didnt realise was that id get all this and so much more tangible and intangible the coaching triad practice sessions were hugely valuable not only did i grow in confidence as a coach i found i resolved many issues for myself and my business while being privileged to encounter different coaching styles and strategies my own coaching style is richer and ive built strong relationships with other talented coaches and opportunities to joint venture and work together in interesting and lucrative ways how to market ourselves as a coach was an integral part of the course an area that didnt really excite me at first but marions knack to inject interest into marketing and her rich knowledge and resources made it flow naturally and easily
7769726 the abundant coach programme is fabulous it really chivvies you into doing things that you were avoiding everyone is immensely helpful and its fantastic value for money
7769727 what can i say about marion honest supportive fun and always challenging you to be the person she knows you can be i emphasise she knows you can be she has faith in you when you dont always have faith in yourself to be the best marion has the knack of being able to understand you when others seem to have failed looking deep into what you are saying she also imparts so much of herself and her knowledge when she is coaching which is the sort of coaching i needed i was always unsure of what i was doing but marion has given me the confidence to sort things out in my own way and be able to say to myself i can do it
7769728 the abundant coach takes over from where your training course left you qualified but unsure what to do to get started it provides answers to all your questions even those you didnt know about you can ask what you think are stupid questions knowing that you will get a considered answer and will be treated with respect the programme gives you so much practical advice to help you develop your business the best aspect of the abundant coach is the support you get from marion and fellow members of the group every time someone has achieved a goal everyone celebrates their success this is amazingly motivational and makes you want to achieve more yourself there is just so much love and support in the group i have been amazed at the progress everyone has made it has been a fantastic and fun experience which is held together brilliantly by marion i totally recommend it
7769729 i liked the overall construction of the course it contained a lot more than i had expected it to i feel i have heaps of information and a far better understanding of how i can build an online business than i did before the course it was great for someone as technically challenged as me to learn how to get my business online in such an enjoyable and supportive environment
7769730 i would encourage any new coach who is struggling with marketing and technical challenges to subscribe to the abundant coach marion creates a safe place for everyone to develop in their own individual way its extremely encouraging well organised and hands on because of the encouragement i received i ran a successful bootcamp for my too active to retire programme as a result of this course i know i am heading in the right direction with great confidence and i know the support of marion and the other participants will always be there
7769731 i was at a place where i found i had little direction or support
7769732 the abundant coach programme is amazing value for money great content and support whilst teaching me a great deal about marketing i can never thank marion enough for having given me the confidence to believe in myself as a coach if you want to know about marion ryan think funny generous warm hearted and oh i nearly forgot brilliant coach
7769733 i am much clearer about where i am headed have new clients plans for products and coaching programmes and an explosion of confidence i finally know exactly what my coaching practice looks like and i have two more niches that are absolutely me i have launched an ebook been a guest on 3 teleseminars and built a second website people on the programme are getting things done and sounding much more confident and purposeful if youre tottering on the brink my encouragement to you is just do it
