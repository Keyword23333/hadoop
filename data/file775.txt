7750008 the price of textbooks continues to climb and theres not much we can do about that so we decided to try a rental program
7750009 its an ongoing evaluation so we need to see the return rate on books
7750010 we dont want to be in the situation where we expand it too much and the return rate is bad its not a good feel buying replacement books every year

7750068 we came to addis ababa expecting to get a better life
7750069 sometimes the residents give us some food but sometimes we sleep hungry
7750070 one reason for the urban food crisis is the huge gap between demand and supply
7750071 the demand is increasing beyond expectation while the supply is less
7750072 increases in staple food prices are coming at a time of already high and extreme levels of food insecurity in some regions
7750073 at the same time livestock prices and labour rates have increased only minimally further reducing the overall purchasing power of poor and very poor households
7750074 when local production fails to feed the people one looks at global markets
7750075 but despite ethiopias move to import food from the international market the prices are still not affordable to urban dwellers
7750076 the global situation has affected the response not the problem
7750077 the problem remains the increasing population and poor farming methods there has to be emphasis on helping people to recover
7750078 previously farmers brought their products and sold to wholesalers without prefixed price
7750079 now unless they get a buyer at their price they wait for a good offer

7750081 prime minister kevin rudd and consumer affairs minister chris bowen must acknowledge the absurdity of grocerychoice and shut the site down immediately
7750082 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7750083 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7750084 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7750085 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores

7750152 what does one call a lawmaker who would condemn to death the child survivor of a botched abortion by permitting doctors to refuse that child once born alive potentially life saving medical treatment and nutrition
7750153 so we now add a new word with a dual definition to our modern political lexicon obamacide it means 1 killing the newborn survivor of a botched abortion through a deliberate act of omission and 2 that which a nation commits upon itself by electing one who would allow such a thing
7750154 while serving in the illinois state senate he led the fight against a state version of born alive that was substantively identical to the federal baipa in 2002 baipa passed the u s senate with unanimous bipartisan support yet obama vehemently opposed its illinois twin

7750177 our research disputes a major pillar holding up the long held assumption that homo sapiens were more advanced than neanderthals it is time for archaeologists to start searching for other reasons why neanderthals became extinct while our ancestors survived
7750178 technologically speaking there is no clear advantage of one tool over the other when we think of neanderthals we need to stop thinking in terms of stupid or less advanced and more in terms of different

7750181 this is a match we have to win to remain in contention for the play offs were all disappointed with the performance against the dragons but all we can worry about now is preparing properly to take on penrith
7750182 at the same time its important for the club as a whole and for the fans to honour ruben logan and wairangi who have all made such a big contribution to the warriors

7750189 the donor community was not ready to come to our rescue so we had to look for alternatives
7750190 we had just come out of a long war our economy had been devastated and the country had massive social needs
7750191 china was willing to understand this reality and put a huge financial package on the table this is the main reason angola decided to enter into a relationship with china
7750192 angola desperately needs help in reconstructing their country after the war
7750193 it is very important for our company to do a good job in helping angola develop
7750194 i think so far people generally see it as a positive thing
7750195 we see infrastructure being repaired and thats happening quite fast as far as i know there is not much tension it will be interesting to follow this and see how it will evolve its a real mixing of people and cultures on many different levels
7750196 the concern is that there is little national capacity and planning for the effective use of this credit line some of the projects are simply wasteful prestige projects such as sports stadiums that will burn a lot of that credit line for results that wont produce economic returns in the long term for angola
7750197 just because parties sometimes cannot agree on a particular business point does not imply the relationship is not good

7750203 we have a masters course in economics and doctorate of philosophy ph d courses but we do not really offer specialisations the masters programme was designed years ago and needs to change
7750204 gipe began as a research institute and later we added academic programmes we cannot continue the same academic programme for years especially since we are a deemed university we should have several programmes because of this and thats one reason why we want to expand
7750205 we require one more building to house the new courses we will also require a hostel in the future we did not seek anything spectacular in the 10th plan except making a demand for teachers that has since been accomplished but now we realise the need to keep pace with the fast changing world

7750217 the organisers of the programme wanted the idol to be sent from pune because of the citys famous ganesh festival celebrations as also its rich cultural heritage
7750218 the programme will be held from august 29 to august 31 and is expected to see participants from around 25 countries this includes members of the european parliament the president of the european union the prime minister of the netherlands the mayor of hague and leaders of various religious groups
7750219 it was at the request of brijmohan gupta the chairman of the organisation who is an acquaintance that we sent the idol to london in 2005
7750220 the international court of justice is based there and it being a symbol of peace the hague was the best possible place to celebrate the ganesh festival especially since lord ganesh is considered a symbol of peace
7750221 in fact when the uk government accepted the application to immerse the idol in the thames in the previous years it surprised many of us but their decision is a sign of hope and tolerance

7750246 following a difficult first half year mpc capital has set itself very ambitious objectives for the second half of 2008 as expected we were able to start distribution of a number of important products towards the end of the second quarter we are therefore confident that the product portfolio that is available for the second half of the year will generate the projected equity result and profits as well as stable margins
7750247 i felt like i was hearing the same rhetoric that id been hearing since the 60s when i started listening to and following political conventions
7750248 i wouldnt take anything away from michelle obamas remarks other than to say that this is an important election this is a big choice for the american people and theyre really going to have to rely on more than a few convention speeches

7750262 what gets attention is not the statistics but the story
7750263 the number of people who are trying to make changes in the vaccination schedule based on what they have heard or seen or read on the internet is climbing every year
7750264 even those who ultimately decide not to alter the schedule have questions about it and every year we spend more time talking about immunizations with parents
7750265 it is important for people to protect themselves as well as others who come in contact with them
7750266 as long as there are pockets in the community that remain unvaccinated that certainly increases the risk of ongoing transmission of measles in the community

7750338 for some people having a fry up might seem like a good way to start the day but if you are doing this regularly then you are significantly increasing your risk of bowel cancer which is one of the most common cancers
7750339 only a third of people are aware of the link between processed meat and cancer which means two thirds are not in a position to make an informed choice about how much of it they eat
7750340 this is not a question of all or nothing because the more processed meat you eat the greater your risk for example if you eat 150g of it a day then you will be increasing your bowel cancer risk by about two thirds
7750341 but if you only eat 50g a day roughly the equivalent of a sausage then you will be increasing your risk by about a fifth as well as the processed meat increasing the risk of bowel cancer fry ups also tend to be high in calories
7750342 we recommend people limit consumption of high calorie or energy dense foods because eating them regularly makes you more likely to gain weight this is important because there is convincing evidence that excess body fat increases risk of six different types of cancer

7750353 while the equity markets are currently focused on downside risks we believe there are potential offsets on the upside based on continued strength in commodity demand low inventory levels and a supply side which continues to face multiple constraints

7750378 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
7750379 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7750380 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them

7750439 selesai shalat dan berdoa hendaklah dia mengerjakan apa yang mau dikerjakan baik hatinya suka atau tidak mantap atau tidak sama saja maka hendaklah dia segera mengerjakannya tidak perlu menunggu nunggu kemantapan dan kesenangan hati karena dia telah menyerahkan pilihannya dan ketentuannya kepada rabbul alamin karena hakekat shalat istikharah ialah memohon kepada allah azza wa jalla pilihan dan ketentuan yang baik atau yang terbaik untuknya dan agar dijauhkan dari sesuatu yang buruk baginya maka apabila dia telah melakukannya hendaklah dia menyerahkan pilihan dan ketentuannya kepada allah jalla wa alaa semata nanti allah sendiri yang akan menentukannya baik atau buruk baginya apabila urusan itu baik untuknya maka allah akan menentuan pilihan untuknya dan apabila urusan itu buruk baginya maka allah akan memalingkan urusan itu darinya sebagimana doa istikhaarah yang telah diajarkan nabi yang mulia shallahu alaihi wa sallam di atas karena allah yang maha mengetahui dan maha berkuasa sedangkan kita tidak mengetahui dan tidak mempunyai kekuasaan oleh karena itu sangat tidak patut dan kurang adab kepada rabbul alamin apabila setelah mengerjakan istikharah kita masih terus saja menunggu nunggu kemantapan hati dengan menunda nunda pekerjaan padahal kita telah menyerahkan pilihan dan ketentuannya kepada rabbul alamin pantaskah kita berada di dalam keraguan setelah kita menyerahkan pilihan dan ketentuannya kepada allah tabaaraka wa taalaa adapun yang biasa beredar dari mulut ke mulut di masyarakat dan dikatakan oleh sebagian ulama seperti an nawawi di kitabnya al adzkar bahwa setelah shalat istikharah akan datang kemantapan hati pada hakikatnya tidak ada asalnya karena nabi yang mulia shallallahu alaihi wa sallam di dalam hadits di atas tidak mensyaratkan kemantapan atau kesenangan hati demikian juga yang biasa beredar di masyarakat bahwa setelah shalat istikharah akan datang mimpi yang menetapkan pilihannya lebih tidak ada asalnya lagi dari nabi yang mulia shallallahu alaihi wa sallam

7750458 the fact that these animals dont die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe many scientists including us thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin weve been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency
7750459 these animals were actually dying but if we gave them the leptin gene within two weeks the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment
7750460 my hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action glucagons suppression for example and insulin for another or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely what would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections

7750634 clearly thats not what the average user is going to pay per month for their video service
7750635 a lot of indian companies are looking at western europe this is our first acquisition there and right now our focus is to make sure that this process goes through before we talk about where we go next
7750636 our rationale was that with this acquisition our global reach scale and our ability to participate in large transformational deals would be significantly enhanced
7750637 if i thought we were really deep and had unbelievable quickness then we probably wouldnt but for us i think we need to put our starters out there
7750638 but just as far as the amount of field position thats exchanged
7750639 when we got here i felt we had to take at least 25 minutes every day that are devoted to special teams every single day
7750640 were going to have to be able to hit it deep and knock it out of the end zone where other times what we might have to do is hit a deep kick thats got a ton of air up underneath it and maybe that ball lands on the 2 yard line and theyve got to bring it out
7750641 i think it was evident during the bowl game that hes capable of utilizing the sky kick which i think can be a quality weapon
7750642 we want our players to develop a good volleyball iq
7750643 knowing and being able to read the other team makes it easier to defend them were always defensively sound but beyond that you have to be able to get into your offense and have it be effective
7750644 you never know if youre rebuilding or reloading until you put your team on the court
7750645 were aiming high hopefully it all comes together we could be in line for a good season
7750646 we have a lot of seniors and two newcomers who will impact the team greatly we have a ton of experience at the setting position and our strong hitters will all bring in big numbers
7750647 i dont think it will end up being that big of a transition for us
7750648 weve been playing smoky hill and grandview and teams like that for years now so i think we at least know what were up against
7750649 were really strong this year just in technical ability and speed
7750650 we have great touch and with players like javier salome and jake martinez were going to have some of the most creative attackers
7750651 its going to be great to have some of those leaders on defense this year
7750652 it will allow us to keep our quick offense going and still shut down other teams
7750653 last year we were kind of a team with a couple of superstars and we dont have those guys this year
7750654 but i think thats making us play better as a unit and were seeing guys develop into roles that we need really nicely
7750655 we have a lot of speed and technical skill this year especially at midfield
7750656 were really going to be looking to them to get our attack going and help us be solid on defense
7750657 i was able to settle into a rhythm and be aggressive with my fastball
7750658 i used my changeup a lot and that was big also
7750659 he definitely deserves it with the year hes having hes been there all year for us

7750673 this strong growth in new customers and substantial uplift in our recurring billing base gives amcom a very significant platform to drive future earnings growth our lead indicators are positive

7750689 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7750690 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7750691 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7750703 it is all too easy to find the 100 women who will protest at the convention and they become the story
7750704 rather than to talk about the underlying numbers of women voters who in droves will vote for obama
7750705 people dont know yet that john mccain is just bad for women
7750706 talking about these differences is clearly a pathway to generating intensity among women voters
7750707 these swing women voters have tremendous economic anxiety right now
7750708 women are going to the watercooler and talking about what just happened in georgia
7750709 they are not unmindful of the way the world impacts on them
7750710 my idea that i was safe was completely shaken and destroyed but im trying to build it back
7750711 all i can think about is going back to school because im anxious to start classes
7750712 theres more of a sense of community now and i feel like im a part of it i feel like thats my home and thats where i should be
7750713 we have a very good relationship with the students here
7750714 we will certainly be vigilant in the way we do our policing
7750715 i dont go in with any ill will or any kind of fear i have faith in my faculty and the people around me
7750716 i think that a lot of it had to do with the fact that i dealt with kids the whole summer
7750717 i got a sense of what other people were doing in response which was helpful to see
7750718 if anything its more positive because i was able to witness the community outreach
7750719 it just cast a really somber shadow over the class
7750720 going into the summer i kind of stepped away from everything that happened leaving town was kind of like leaving it behind for a while
7750721 itll definitely be on my mind but i think im just looking to resume the pattern of classes and kind of concentrate on that
7750722 im a little bit more wary about the possibilities that things can happen the main thought that i have is the best way to overcome it or get past it is just to be as much of a community as you can be it affects our lives but we dont have to let it control our lives we can hope for something better
7750723 i was just trying to not pass out from the anxiety and the nervousness
7750724 i told the moms and dads of these players that i would take care of their kids and put out a decent product along the way im glad that it worked out that way today
7750725 all of us from the very beginning had in our minds that we wouldnt let up until the school board said we could go ahead and have a team
7750726 weve had two years of working sellersburg celebrates fish frys car washes
7750727 any opportunity we saw to get money for this cause we took
7750728 we hope the community will keep coming out this season
7750729 if they see how well we can compete we can continue to get the support that we need
7750730 i just want to give credit to my coaching staff
7750731 im also very proud of the boys were just going to celebrate this and then get our heads back into it because floyd central isnt going to be easy
7750732 its hectic and even more so because of the storms because they wouldve come here once and at least put up their supplies
7750733 he went to pre k and we kind of started early so i prepped him early
7750734 i told him youre going to big kids school now
7750735 there was anxiety and she was anxious because of the storms
7750736 but she didnt cry and she was excited when she saw the crayons
7750737 everybodys got their game faces on this is what its all about
7750738 the anticipation of watching these teachers work with the kids is overwhelming
7750739 you had the whole summer to rest what time did you get up this morning
7750740 ive got so much on my mind i dont even know who i am right now
7750741 i cant tell you how excited mr hartman and i are you all are fantastic and im glad everyone is here
7750742 its better having a locker because you can store your stuff in it and no one will take it
7750743 we need to get kids to class and reduce anxiety so tomorrow they will come in and know the routine
7750744 we are not about tearing each other down were about building each other up
7750745 theres a real genuine feel of disappointment by our athletes
7750746 hopefully that will fuel them for the future to great success
7750747 because these guys wanted medals they didnt come here to play
7750748 but obviously we have to go back and figure that out
7750749 since were that close its going to give us hope for the future 2012 should be exciting

7750760 we had some growing pains then and were going to need some help now
7750761 we can simplify what they do back there much easier
7750762 the one that runs out there first it really doesnt matter
7750763 this group is determined to move on with the next phase of their life
7750764 as a result this segment of buyer is out there looking to make that change and is willing to overlook market obstacles in the way and some of the downtrodden feeling that may be out there
7750765 the general feeling is that we just dont have time to wait until the next cycle comes back
7750766 small medium or large even in todays soft market active adult builders are selling homes
7750767 amenities to get the lifestyle and perceived value are critical
7750768 builders have to distinguish themselves from the competition to show they are different and better from other communities
7750769 many dont need to sell a home to buy a new one
7750770 were going to see tough times for small to mid sized builders who will continue to sell homes at market price
7750771 a new outlook a fresh outlook consumers should be more confident and we should take advantage of that
7750772 the first time buyer tax credit does help in selling the existing home
7750773 it just opened up their audience and if they understand enough about it they can help first time buyers understand what opportunities there are
7750774 most important is the emotional impact that there is something new in the marketplace that wasnt there before and an elevation in consumer confidence that things will be fine
7750775 we need to ask them what issues are in the way
7750776 have anxiety about selling their current home because they dont really understand their equity position
7750777 buying low is a great opportunity and selling low is not a bad opportunity either
7750778 potentially the lowest prices that they will see for a very long time
7750779 solve other issues so they can take advantage of this opportunity
7750780 this is an amazing buyers market were not just talking about a home in the neighborhood but quality of life that your customer can put a value on you dont want to miss another day of living here
7750781 you want to make it sound more like a business proposition where they are trying to maximize the price of their house
7750782 builders want to retain control of the process of selling the existing home make sure the house is priced properly
7750783 we can help you manage the sale better than you can
7750784 what is their neighborhood like today have all their friends moved away what about the security is there too much idle time
7750785 i really want that and i dont like where i am today
7750786 ive been talking with two of my clients about asset recognition and urging their prospects that dont need to sell their current home to move now while they can take advantage of the soft market they finally agreed
7750787 and in the end after all thats happened these past 19 months the barack obama i know today is the same man i fell in love with 19 years ago
7750788 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president i come here as a mom whose girls are the heart of my heart and the center of my world
7750789 i am absolutely convinced that both hillary clinton and bill clinton understand the stakes
7750790 my fellow americans it is so wonderful to be here
7750791 and nothing nothing is going to keep me away from this special gathering tonight
7750792 we are after all democrats so it may take a while
7750793 were not the fall in line party we are diverse but make no mistake we are unified
7750794 we say that john mccain has the experience of being wrong
7750795 is a 21st century patriot who sees beyond the years
7750796 i know what a great leader can do to help us find common ground america we need such a leader today a leader who can heal the wounds of the last eight years a leader who knows that what unites us is greater than what divides us
7750797 i said mr president you can say whatever you like bill clinton is a unique figure in our politics
7750798 there may be a few of us who go for mccain but most of us understand we need to kick republicans out of the white house
7750799 a bible budget is fine but what of a koran budget and one based on the troah
7750800 the significant structural and economic changes in the marketplace are prompting all automakers to further refine actions to respond to these pressures
7750801 at bmw were responding with a number of internal efficiency improvements to offset our increased costs so that we can keep this price increase modest
7750802 its very helpful to have a contraceptive options that has been shown to ease some of the intense physical and emotional symptoms associated with this condition
7750803 this 24 4 regimen combined with the low dose of hormones can improve the severe physical and emotional ups and downs some women experience with pmdd

7750810 when firefox users click on a web site that uses a self signed certificate they get a security error message that leaves many people bewildered
7750811 im personally concerned that that lack of history that we have in this state continues to permit the type of hysteria thats taking place at this moment against immigrants
7750812 so because of that i believe that education and knowledge are vital tools against hysteria racism and nativism
7750813 it was a horrific circumstance two and a half million americans were deported to a country that was not even theirs cedillo says
7750814 its a very dark period in american and california history and we should not try to hide that history we should be aware of it
7750815 research shows that embracing native histories and traditions also known as culturally relevant teaching increases student success and may aid in reducing the achievement gap between students of color and their peers
7750816 i had interns bring in their textbooks and many of them dont mention it contributions of italian americans its just one line and that doesnt pertain to just italian americans but many accomplishments by many other groups give that challenge to those who write the curriculum to be better its not fantastic but it could be better
7750817 asking them to do it is different from allowing them from doing it
7750818 when these books are in their normal course of being updated they should just be updated so were not asking for additional costs
7750819 for a senator who prides himself on his foreign policy experience bidens record shows great ambivalence about american participation in the global economy
7750820 there is absolutely no cause for this no reason for this continuing divide
7750821 wilder said adding later that he came to the morning panel to
7750822 we learned coming out of the caucuses that sound bites can in fact be detrimental
7750823 so irrespective of what may or may not happen on the convention floor the problem is you might have two or three people who will say something and that may become the headline
7750824 the longer youre divided the longer it takes for us to get the ball rolling
7750825 weve only got four good prime time hours at this convention and were using one of them for this
7750826 all i can say is obamas a bigger man than i am
7750827 when former presidents come to a convention they talk about what they want to talk about
7750828 i know this is going to happen because hillary clinton is a professional
7750829 they might have a statue with hillary clinton and barack obama embracing
7750830 building an overflow detention center gave us a sign they were going to make mass arrests
7750831 were going to stay nonviolent and i hope that relieves them
7750832 hey cops what do you say how many people you gonna shoot today
7750833 we will not tolerate any action by any leader that harms the interests of our membership
7750834 tyrone freeman has taken our dues and done unjustifiable things with them
7750835 dealing with the enormous problems and concerns about global warming may be the biggest challenge of our generation
7750836 the only way to deal with this challenge is to focus our energy and intellectual capital
7750837 anything funded through rates is a concern for us especially in the economic conditions were in now
7750838 were seeing more and more shut offs and expect the situation to get worse
7750839 to achieve olympic glory for the motherland is the sacred mission assigned by the communist party central
7750840 you have no control over your own life coaches are with you all the time people are always watching you the doctors even the chefs in the cafeteria you have no choice but to train so as not to let the others down
7750841 i wanted to be a ballet dancer but they said pingpong was right for me
7750842 the sports systems of the united states and china are very accurate metaphors for our societies china is a society run by engineers based on planning and coordination and central planning
7750843 the state is the supreme entity and the role of the individual is to support the state
7750844 truth be told this old soviet system works if you are going to scan the whole population of 1 3 billion for a certain body type and then throw vast resources into training them you will produce champions
7750845 divers who start at an early age before the eye is fully developed have great chance for injuries
7750846 we were fortunate enough to research 396 subjects almost twice the size of the largest aids study previously done there so we were extremely pleased about that
7750847 that was my favorite part because i got to do every kind of medical procedure imaginable as a college student
7750848 my summer gave me a concrete reason to be a doctor
7750849 it gave me a sense of compassion for the people of the third world and it made me so thankful to be born into the life i have
7750850 i was able to understand the true pressures of holding this type of office with such huge responsibilities yet i was able to get to know the governor and his staff as individuals
7750851 without experiencing this internship i would not be as socially developed as i am now
7750852 i gained confidence communication skills and learned how to deal with extreme pressure as a result of being put in this environment
7750853 you can pretty much read any of these reviews to get a good impression of dinner at zenkichi
7750854 goddammit people i want a cupcake just like everyone else in this city
7750855 if the haters who said i wasnt a real journalist are still lurking
7750856 i hope you dont have too much indigestion after eating your words
7750857 to come to grips with the fact that he was simply a person with a video camera who happened to record some public events
7750858 but it feels like its much harder for them to make their point now that its how i earn my paycheck
7750859 but i think its understood youre trying to get the facts of the story a reader can easily understand and no story is free of minute details that are also important
7750860 first block of embarcadero six windows were reported broken at 10 59 a
7750861 we didnt see journalist in that description and that made us wonder were we getting behind a guy who was not there to gather news but who was involved in the protests
7750862 i cant speak for josh but there was this thinking going around at the time oh man down with the mainstream media yet it was the mainstream media who was right there to help josh out
7750863 there are very few easy poster children for good causes of journalism
7750864 its less important for people to debate who is a journalist and more important for people to consider is it journalism
7750865 if his only journalistic quality is that he runs around with a camera and films stuff then a whole lot of teenagers can be considered journalists
7750866 the fact is that all journalism is based on solid writing
7750867 and there is no better place to practice the fundamentals of journalism than at a local daily newspaper
7750868 i will die alone upside down in a pub toilet

7750901 ville skyde obama med et gev r p 750 meters afstand
7750902 det er paradoksalt at man omhyggeligt giver en skattelettelse til danskerne i form af et h jere besk ftigelsesfradrag et h jere personfradrag og en h jere gr nse for betaling af mellemskat for blot at opkr ve en god del af skattelettelsen i form af tvangsopsparing
7750903 man kan dog godt stille sp rgsm lstegn ved stilleskruerne i den konomiske politik vi mener ikke at gensynet med sp opsparingen er s rligt lykkeligt sp opsparingen er et meget upr cist styringsinstrument og i tider med konomisk usikkerhed ville sikre styringsinstrumenter klart v re at foretr kke

7750911 it conserves on fuel and helps improve air quality by reducing emissions around the schools
7750912 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7750913 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7750914 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7750915 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7750916 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7750917 feel an obligation to the people who sent them here
7750918 the democratic party strongly and unequivocally supports roe v wade and a womans right to choose a safe and legal abortion regardless of ability to pay and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right
7750919 really cant explain the price of gas or what has happened to the middle class
7750920 do we really want four more years of the same old tune
7750921 we are ready to compete in all 50 states in november
7750922 theres a moment that you want to enjoy your bitterness
7750923 to try to suppress the celebration that we all want to have about her achievements is what would tear this party apart
7750924 im getting a lot of calls and e mails especially from women who are quite upset that she was not vetted for vice president even though senator obama said she was on the short list
7750925 to stay wallowing in all of this is not productive
7750926 so we can talk about this forever or we can talk about how were going to take our message to the american people to women all across america to see the distinctions
7750927 when i applied for this job i had done quite a bit of research
7750928 impressed with the quality of so many things about northwest college
7750929 weve been in communities similar to powell in smaller rural areas but this is our first time in wyoming were having a great time and it has been a wonderful move for our family
7750930 it enables high school students to earn college credit during the school day and im excited about that program
7750931 its a new program that strives to give them more consistent aid throughout their sophomore years
7750932 one of the very best in the nation certainly in the top five
7750933 its a good match for me high expectations thats a good thing so i am going to work hard to live up to those expectations
7750934 all of you are aware of the serious nature of this years fire season and the issues faced by the agency in paying for fire suppression costs
7750935 at this time the only option for financing the shortfall is to use the agencys transfer authority
7750936 the unfortunate thing is that it is across the board
7750937 i recognize that this direction will have a significant effect on agency operations
7750938 however we must be in a position to protect life and property from wildfire and do so within the funds available to the agency
7750939 the fire season in montana and across the country is far from over not to mention we have good paying jobs to fund and projects around the state that need to be completed
7750940 funding should not be pulled from our states resources to help pay for fighting fires in california
7750941 the costs are high and they need to suppress these fires to protect people
7750942 but the forest service is basically becoming the fire service
7750943 the heavy air tankers are a pretty heavy duty resource theyre a substantial tool in our arsenal
7750944 were hearing more and more about the obesity issue and what we need is to really pay attention to what we eat and exercise
7750945 there was a big correlation between people keeping track of their food intake exercise and weight and weight loss
7750946 a lot of times we eat mindlessly and arent as active as we think we are as soon as we start writing it down its hard to lie to ourselves
7750947 if i get a ticket ill probably go but i havent been falling on my sword to try to get them
7750948 im sure there are other people who would wish to go
7750949 they did their best given their short time window to figure out a way that was as evenhanded to everyone as they possibly could be recognizing that they wanted to recognize colorado and the people there hosting the convention
7750950 unfortunately the state closest to denver is the state with the lowest number of registered democrats and the lowest population and they have to be fair to everybody
7750951 thats the name i put on my pro prca card
7750952 my dad told me his first 20 years of competing he hardly won a dime

7750954 its a place where you can go to a lot of rodeos with the least amount of traveling
7750955 i was standing at this 65 roping jackpot and there is fred whitfield
7750956 its good competing against all those guys you go to a small jackpot and there are world champions there i think it helps because you really have to be on your game every time out now im pretty relaxed
7750957 ill go a little harder next year and see what happens
7750958 i darn sure want to give rodeo a try someday but i dont want to go broke in the process
7750959 obviously the safety and protection of our participants is our number one priority
7750960 it probably would be pretty difficult for us to say yup thats where he got it because youre talking about a pretty wide area
7750961 the air force is committed to looking at all options of syn fuels
7750962 in the near future a decision will be made in regards to malmstrom and the coal to liquid initiative and possible facilities
7750963 its a big decision really big and a long commitment
7750964 it will be a decision that is really up to the next administration
7750965 depending on the political will to get something done some of these will be built
7750966 but tomorrow the publics not going to see dirt turning
7750967 i was trying to steer the car i have a butterfly steering wheel i was actually turning the wheel grabbing it and turning more

7750973 im the only accountant in the senate but i manage to hold my own if we could get two of us it would really make a difference
7750974 that issue is keeping anything else from working in the immigration area the congressional hispanic caucus wont let anything else be debated until amnesty is included
7750975 the cost of gasoline has gotten everybodys attention and wait till they get fuel bills for heating this winter

7750986 this industry first survey will generate the highest possible resolution seismic image of the reservoir a survey of this density was made feasible based on the results of our extensive research and development to create unique technologies and methodologies for continued improvement of image quality and increased efficiency of operations this combination best addresses our customers needs for very high resolution solutions considering its volume density and technical requirements this contract also reinforces the position of cggveritas and its regional joint venture ardiseis as the worldwide leader in the growing high end seismic segment
7750987 praying for their process in seeking gods will for the opening

7750995 i have always said that third is a reaction position and thats pretty much what i did i that situation
7750996 i knew the pitcher was at third so i didnt have to rush it it turned out to be a big play
7750997 he always makes it look like hes throwing hard than pitcher
7750998 but hes so accurate nobody never says anything about it
7750999 it was right on the bag when i went to the plat the next time i told bengie molina that it was a great throw
7751000 i am fine i always hit my foot on the bag funny
7751001 he pitched a good ballgame for them we had him on the ropes and he got out of it with a couple of groundballs that double play was probably the difference in the game give him credit he pitched well
7751002 he holds so much inside i didnt have any idea how much his shoulder was bothering him
7751003 now hes starting to look like the old jeff francis

7751039 cuando los j venes ingresan a las universidades y los centros tecnol gicos lo hacen con la finalidad de obtener conocimientos que les permitan implementar soluciones para mejorar la calidad de vida de su pa s
7751040 en la nueva cantv se ha hecho un esfuerzo significativo para hacer realidad esta idea que se hab a gestado hace mucho tiempo en la corporaci n y este ejemplo se seguir en otras reas de la empresa
7751041 con la instalaci n de los nuevos equipos ahora se cuenta con mayor capacidad de memoria ram y en disco duro para las m ltiples aplicaciones con las cuales debe trabajar el personal del cor ya que un trabajador puede llegar a abrir hasta veinte aplicaciones a la vez por lo tanto la labor puede realizarse de manera m s r pida adem s este proyecto va de la mano con otras iniciativas como la ampliaci n de la red metroethernet con el cual se aumentar la velocidad a la cual se transmiten los datos as como la construcci n de un motogenerador que se planea poner en operaci n en septiembre de este a o para abarcar todas las cargas del edificio amoca
7751042 la habilitaci n de este espacio representa un avance importante para todo el personal del cor ya que se est pensando en estos trabajadores que laboran en turnos durante 24 horas al d a y 7 d as por semana quienes requieren ciertas facilidades que otro personal no necesita para este fin se han creado espacios para cocina salas de descanso y reuniones y ba os de manera que el trabajador pueda realizar su labor de manera eficiente as mismo la amplitud de esta sala permite acomodar a todo el personal encargado de procesos de monitoreo y control de todos los elementos de red ahora incluso los proveedores pueden estar en la misma rea f sica que el personal del cor de movilnet con la cual se favorece la integraci n de estos equipos de trabajo y sus procedimientos
7751043 ahora hay mucho m s espacio para ir creciendo de acuerdo al crecimiento de la red porque por cada nueva plataforma que se instala se requiere un nuevo gestor de monitoreo debido al mismo dinamismo de movilnet y a la incorporaci n de nuevas plataformas y tecnolog as tambi n ha sido necesario adquirir nuevos equipos de monitoreo y control que significan un incentivo para los trabajadores ya que de esta manera tienen la oportunidad de aumentar sus conocimientos tecnol gicos
7751044 en la antigua sala del cor las conexiones de los equipos de monitoreo se efectuaban a 100mbps y el flujo de datos deb a pasar por varios puntos lo que hac a que la comunicaci n con los elementos de red fuera muy lenta actualmente sin embargo los nuevos equipos pc est n conectados directamente al backbone y esto sumado al hecho de que la interfaz de los terminales es ahora de 1gbps permite que los trabajadores puedan observar los equipos casi en tiempo real por otra parte los retrasos en la detecci n de fallas son m nimos es posible gestionar directamente los equipos al no haber intermediarios que puedan fallar en pocas palabra ahora el proceso de monitoreo y control de la red de movilnet puede efectuarse con mayor rapidez y disponibilidad
7751045 desde el punto de vista de infraestructura este proyecto represent un gran reto desde el principio ya que amoca es un edificio viejo que ha venido siendo modernizado y adecuado tecnol gicamente por lo que fue necesario adaptar el edificio a las necesidades del cor lo cual fue bastante complicado el proyecto fue presentado originalmente en 2006 y hasta la fecha siguen realiz ndose muchas mejoras sin embargo las adecuaciones no se reducen al piso 3 sino tambi n a los pisos 1 y 4 y la meta es modernizar toda la estructura del edificio
7751046 es muy agradable observar la amplitud en este espacio de trabajo as como los nuevos equipos pc que han sido conectados al backbone operativo de movilnet con lo cual se obtiene una velocidad de transmisi n de datos mucho mayor que cuando se utilizaban los pc en el piso 4 de amoca esta sala de monitoreo representa un cambio radical con respecto a lo que se ten a antes como ambiente laboral

7751088 hes trying to catch keesha or renny in a lie right now
7751089 ok you simply cannot ask for a better happy hour
7751090 hey have you heard of max brenner its really awesome
7751091 the bishops got together to explain what the church teaches
7751092 thats right and a lot of ideas came out of vatican ii one of the most lasting is the idea of participation the idea that members of the laity are called to participate fully in the mass what do you think of when you hear the word participation
7751093 yes thats generally what participation means and when it comes to the mass its about joining your heart and soul with the prayers of the priest to god during the years after vatican ii the word came to take on a very external meaning do you know what i mean by that
7751094 what i mean is that many people came to believe that to participate at mass meant you had to do things at mass serve as a reader become an extraordinary minister become an altar server it focused on external activities rather than internal things like prayer now some of these things are okay but theyre not what the church really means by participation the church teaches that participation is primarily an internal thing like prayer its an awareness of the mystery being celebrated at mass and how it is connected to our daily lives does this make sense
7751095 its kind of a long story but when your mom and dad were little there were a lot of folks running around claiming to be experts on this sort of thing they said that to get people to participate we need to have them do as many external things as possible some of their ideas are still with us
7751096 it is but its getting better pope benedict is a great teacher and hes been spending a lot of time on the mass
7751097 good indeed lets try a quiz who is participating more at mass the mom holding a baby in the back of the church or the extraordinary minister in the front
7751098 people call them communion ministers or eucharistic ministers theyre supposed to be used in exceptional circumstances even though theyre used all the time
7751099 because of what we were just talking about the idea that participating means doing things external things at mass now back to my question who is participating more the mom or the extraordinary minister
7751100 of course now lets talk for a minute about the priest his role is to sanctify members of the laity what does sanctify mean
7751101 thats right to make something holy the priest serves the people by making them holy sanctifying them how does he do this
7751102 yes through the eucharist the priest consecrates bread and wine into the body and blood of jesus the divine grace that comes to us in the eucharist makes us holy so that we can go out into the world and do the lords work we do this by serving as witnesses at school at play at work so as members of the laity our focus ought to be on what we can do out in the world not in the sanctuary does all of this make sense

7751228 our defense got three extra outs which was nice because it gave dallas another inning
7751229 he got a whole innings worth of outs on the bases it was a heck of a job by him and the defense
7751230 as a staff we really try to stress that and give us every opportunity to get outs any way we can
7751231 as a guy whos not going to light up the radar gun you look for outs in other ways when youre struggling or even when youre going good one of the facets of my game i like to practice is controlling the running game and giving zuke a chance to throw a guy out when he does decide to take off
7751232 i mean nobody wants to be in a hole right out of the gate especially against these guys what are they 148 2 something like that its ridiculous you know that when they get guys on theyre going to get them over and get them in so you try to minimize that it was real good getting out of that without a blemish
7751233 if he runs through second with aggressiveness hes going to make it to third he was reading the play it took a perfect throw but still erick has to run hard to have a chance when he got around the bag he turned it on but obviously it was a step too late
7751234 everybody in the world knows hes going to run and hes usually successful
7751235 so doing a good job of holding that guy on controlling him on the bases and not letting him wreak havoc on the infield is real important
7751236 i was happy about the way i was attacking the strike zone and pitching to contact
7751237 before i was a guy who wanted to light up the ks but now im a guy who really just tries to let the defense do their job
7751238 i think his confidence is going up each time he goes out there his velocity might be up just a tick from last year and hes got a better feel for his changeup
7751239 im not thinking about the past all that matters for cruz is what he does from this point on
7751240 ive been down there doing everything to be back ive been seeing the ball really well this game takes the pressure off and makes me more relaxed
7751241 the last time he came up thats what he did in kansas city
7751242 he was very aggressive and swung the bat very well i like the aggressiveness and how he attacked the balls that were in the zone
7751243 i knew he was killing the ball in triple a
7751244 i tried to work quick and keep a good tempo throughout the game
7751245 i was really focused on hitting my spots nobody wants to start 1 and 0 2 and 0 to guys i made a conscious effort tonight to throw a strike and strike two also it is good to pitch well and win
7751246 it was bad i left a lot of pitches up i left a lot of breaking balls hanging my fastball wasnt good thats one of the games you want to just forget about and just keep moving on
7751247 i would say its a coincidence because hes a very good pitcher
7751248 tonight when he got in trouble he worked out of it we got five runs off him but could have had 10 or 11 but that is what good pitchers do
7751249 anytime you got a team like minnesota thats right there and were getting close to september that kind of enhances it
7751250 weve talked about it anytime you can tie or move ahead of the greats that played the game its very humbling its something you look back and feel very honored you cherish that for sure
7751251 its nice to win this one it hard after the first game it gets you down
7751252 thome has been my favorite player since i was old enough to know about him with the indians
7751253 it was good to get him out the two times but i left a mistake right there for him the last one
7751254 our lineup has changed since the lineup was out there so we were looking at the lineup card to see where we were all at unfortunately we didnt pull it out
7751255 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7751256 were finding ways to win right now and thats what you want
7751257 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7751258 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7751259 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7751260 it wasnt the best pitch to throw at that time
7751261 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7751262 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs
7751263 we just want to win as many games as we can and finish as well as we can

7751278 it is anticipated that a total of 1 189 99 per cent of the expired leases covered during the may consultations will be renewed

7751282 i think that as death becomes near we see old battles from a new perspective and they take on new meaning and richness
7751283 we see the challenges and struggles of our friends and our adversaries and realize they are not so different from our own we see how our experiences even the difficult ones served us and others and like ted kennedy tonight we tend to see and speak with conviction as to what is actually valuable and worth passing forward and we tend to see all that is precious with an increasing clarity because we are about to leave it

7751297 the appeal of stone soup is that this deep area may collect and concentrate different kinds of materials
7751298 the trough between polygons is sort of a trap where things can accumulate
7751299 over a long timescale there may even be circulation of material sinking at the margins and rising at the center
7751300 we had a shootout between stone soup and white stuff in a trench called upper cupboard
7751301 if we had been able to confirm that the white material was a salt rich deposit we would have analyzed that but we were unable to confirm that with various methods

7751305 any suggestion that the cia would imprison her children is wrong and offensive had we known where ms siddiqui was prior to her capture we would have shared that information with our partners in this country and overseas she was a fugitive from american justice
7751306 it was a short story i wrote a long time ago
7751307 ive written short stories since high school and this is one where i thought here was a character that you could write 12 songs around when youre writing the songs all of a sudden you start finding out things about his personality that are even more interesting you have to treat it like a stephen king novel
7751308 hes totally obsessed with this whole spider thing and anybody thats a serial killer is insane
7751309 so i mean you cant sit there and at some points you cant judge him because hes insane
7751310 salvation came as a total surprise because its such a good song
7751311 i found a weakness in his character one morning he wakes up and he doesnt realize if hes right he says what if im wrong it would be like jeffrey dahmer going hey wait a minute what am i doing so then he has this moment of saying is there any chance for salvation considering how violent this guy is thats a great juxtaposition for him
7751312 ive got 100 shows in front of me and it was during the very first show of the psycho drama tour we have a song welcome to my nightmare where theres about six or seven zombies onstage i just got bumped into one of the stairways and it hit me right on the corner it healed up but the first five shows afterwards were just hell especially when they do the hanging theres a three foot drop and theres a jolt when you actually stop that jolt goes right to that there rib
7751313 if david bowie didnt have the songs he would be that orange haired guy who was in space if elton didnt have the hits he would be that funny little guy with the glasses
7751314 but when you have no more mr nice guy schools out im eighteen elected and poison then you have some validity because youve got the songs to back them up
7751315 i kind of feel sorry for young bands because the music business right now does not really give you more than three years if youre in a band right now and youre the hottest band in the world youve got three years and thats too bad

7751326 democracy is not waiting to vote once every four years democracy is getting out in the streets
7751327 they the politicians are not gonna do it by themselves were gonna force their hand because that is the nature of democracy
7751328 especially now with a candidate who talks a lot about hope and change people talk about why do you need to protest

7751330 i think that we need to define what hope and change are we need to decide what that means to us as a people
7751331 for people who are disenfranchised by the system some of them for the first time are being motivated into politics
7751332 we want to create a broad progressive movement that can invite these newly politicized people in and we want to create a campaign that can take that beyond the voting booth
7751333 the story obama tells about how were gonna change this world by regular people taking action
7751334 creates more space for social movement organizing in a way we havent had since the 60s i would like to see the conventions and the protests around them take full advantage of that opportunity
7751335 use both conventions to put forward a narrative that we are starting a new chapter in american history our job is to be part of that progressive wave and to pull it to the left as much as we can
7751336 because obamas running they think weve got them theyre coming out theyre gonna support obama no matter what
7751337 some of us arent so sure that its gonna make a difference
7751338 the candidacy of obama is a reflection of the publics desire for something different
7751339 we believe that despite the rhetoric obama uses genuine change will always come from the bottom up and that means countering the system as a whole
7751340 people have learned that a top down approach to things doesnt work
7751341 what we have in common is a desire to break the spell that elections have over the us left
7751342 our message is one of direct participation in democracy bypassing corrupt politicians who dont represent us but instead further corporate interests
7751343 the rnc is a very easy target because they are so visibly to blame for whats happening in this country
7751344 theres a whole lot more energy for the rnc than the dnc
7751345 i dont know what to make of shutting down the rnc
7751346 id like to see more of a consciousness raising thing i dont want the left to be perceived as crazy
7751347 we know that it is the police not protesters or activists who will have the tasers guns rubber bullets concussion grenades chemical weapons helicopters the media spin machine and millions of dollars on their side
7751348 were just hoping that the denver police dont recreate the violence that happened in chicago in 68
7751349 it provides inspiration and an example of what can be possible
7751350 but it can also prove a disservice if we just recreate 68 we will be destined to also recreate its problems
7751351 that culture of activist summit hopping im not really into that i do think it is important to show a resistance to both parties i just think that there are different ways that people go about doing that and i hope we dont lose steam over this election weve got a long way to go
7751352 is to get to work organizing where we are at our campuses workplaces and in our communities while at the same time building links with people struggling all around the world
7751353 ive been over a couple of times with jimmy and john paul just trying to do some new material and writing
7751354 so i dont know what it will be but it will be something i mean this is something that i always wanted to do but trying to predict what it will be at the moment all i know is i have the greatest pleasure to go and jam with the two guys and try and work on some new material so its been fantastic in that aspect
7751355 id say its too early to tell the possibility of doing something i really felt like it was in the cards from the moment we walked off stage after the o2 reunion show at londons o2 arena last december
7751356 there was obviously a lot of politics and things it wasnt just as cut and dry as just go and do it

7751359 what were seeing is people are afraid that if it goes much lower opec might do something to keep it up said david johnson an oil analyst with macquarie securities in hong kong
7751360 seven has kept the accc regularly updated on its purchase of shares in wan and this review was foreshadowed by the accc some time ago seven said today

7751363 i hate to say i see things more like a coach now but i think thats the experienced part of me speaking
7751364 as a player a lot of times you just think of yourself i realize the most important thing is the team although i want to play
7751365 im going to see what it looks like in practice and then evaluate it
7751366 the system i have had in my head for the last 16 years wont just be washed away i felt a lot more comfortable the other night although we made a lot more mistakes which falls back on me i am not going to say its getting easier but its definitely more easily correctable
7751367 they come in a lot of different ways you get rolled up in a pile you know the turf does it you do it in practice but ive played so many games and not that i havent been injured but ive overcome injuries
7751368 hey i mean this is 18 years whatever is going to happen is going to happen

7751371 there was discussion about the fact that the market has become increasingly competitive and that for us to be able to continue to maintain our level of competitiveness in australia we need to work with the government on future transitional assistance programs
7751372 mr mulally reiterated the significant investment that ford has made in australia over the past 82 plus years including recent significant investment such as the development of the all new falcon and the fact that australia is the global engineering lead of the corporations next global light pick up truck

7751386 we miss a play and it ended up costing us a ball game go to the ninth its normally a done deal for us

7751406 you cant have those sort of cuts and keep providing the same sorts of service to your community
7751407 i was very shocked to find out the problems were as bad as they were
7751408 they were never positioned by management to positively influence operations across the district

7751419 boats greater than 8 5 feet can use any road today from dawn to dusk on weekdays school days therefore these boats are currently using these same routes with these same school buses passing over these same narrow bridges every day the veto of this bill will not change that fact

7751426 i wont actually be seeing people but its that first interview when someone first sees you thats whats important
7751427 i had nothing i would have worn to an interview being a single mom my kids come first i hadnt been doing a lot of shopping for myself
7751428 we are the luckiest women in the world to do what we do
7751429 i love money and money loves me i make money easily im a money magnet
7751430 its no more important than the four games we have in chicago after every game is the playoffs right now
7751431 you draw it up and the law of averages says youre going to score some runs but you cant depend on that
7751432 hes a good dude hes real honest about who he thinks are tough pitchers
7751433 i had a feeling he was sitting on a breaking ball
7751434 even if he sits on it its hard to hit sometimes
7751435 you have to have that feeling of how to pitch
7751436 he was patient he had short quick swings and stayed on the ball

7751439 my dad has been waiting for this moment his whole life
7751440 they came to n c state werent highly recruited and their first year they were on the cover of sports illustrated they were doing something about freshmen who made an impact sports illustrated told me it came down to archie griffin or the buckey twins and they said they went with the buckey twins
7751441 he wasnt highly recruited and came to south carolina and what i learned from him is you can succeed if nobody believes in you you cant succeed if you dont believe in yourself he was absolutely right he wasnt fast he wasnt big he was 5 10 180 pounds but was mvp in the bowl game when we beat ohio state
7751442 the game that turned it around was probably the duke game when we were 1 2 1 we put on a great goal line stand
7751443 we had the second largest turnaround in the history of ncaa football from 0 11 in 1999 to 8 4 in 2000 that was a monumental win
7751444 when i was at n c state we had four little children n c state didnt pay you a whole lot so we didnt eat out a whole lot
7751445 two passes hit our defensive backs hands and bounced over his head and they caught them for touchdowns we just didnt play as well as i thought they could have or should have
7751446 we had a touchdown called back for offensive pass interference and then he clemsons rod gardner pushes off and catches it to set up the winning touchdown
7751447 the rain was unbelievable it was the most miserable ive ever seen i remember we played a very good defensive football game we moved the ball but we turned it over
7751448 the fans at n c state were really tremendous they sold the stadium out sat on that hill back there and were enthusiastic the fans at south carolina even when you lose there were 80 000 there theyre very good schools but theyre city schools also they have a campus but they have a city theres a lot to do its a great place to live there really are a lot more similarities than there are things that are dissimilar
7751449 they have great talent they have potentially four or five first round draft picks on defense
7751450 parchments and treaties are all very well but we have a history in poland of fighting alone and being left to our own devices by our allies
7751451 its been a crazy camp ive never had one like this said third year coach darrell asberry who conducted a kind of football boot camp with more contact and conditioning than usual
7751452 we still have to fill voids with young guys in the offensive line coach michael costa said
7751453 but weve made great strides guys understand the offense now
7751454 i would like to see somebody do an investigation into the quality of our water in san jose
7751455 he sure does have a keen eye for a lot of little things
7751456 when youre a good hitter you can make adjustments pretty quick
7751457 he looked pretty impressive to me he drove the ball he hit hard and he hit it to all fields
7751458 hes looking like the hitter he was early in the season wed like to get him back to the no 5 hole and if he keeps swinging the bat like that thats where hell be
7751459 i havent been swinging the bat well and i needed to square some balls up and hopefully that will get me going and i can contribute again to this team thats playing so well
7751460 i didnt throw strikes and when i did they hit them
7751461 its a good lineup from top to bottom and even though they had some guys who were struggling they can hit
7751462 karstens wasnt hitting his spots and you cant do that against this lineup
7751463 its definitely nice when were swinging the bats the way were capable of
7751464 i was thinking i could cut off the run at home plate to protect that shutout
7751465 when he takes the mound hes throwing filthy filthy stuff
7751466 six rbis a couple of homers i think its the right time
7751467 thats probably as good a performance as ive seen against us this year
7751468 whenever they give me the ball im going to take it
7751469 big difference is when the guys pounding the zone throwing strikes
7751470 when i got in i regretted it my hamstrings were tight and my quads hurt
7751471 just take it game by game and dont worry about how many games youre down if we take care of business and keep on taking care of business every day everything else will take care of itself
7751472 we just did not execute well at home early and we didnt execute well on the road early weve been on a nice little roll now
7751473 im making better pitches now than i was before im commanding my fastball a lot better and im able to stay ahead in a lot more counts
7751474 he made a mistake early in the game but overall he pitched a good ballgame he pitched well enough to win but we just couldnt get enough runs for him
7751475 anytime you can dodge a situation like that i think some momentum can swing your way
7751476 molinas been a tough out for us so youre always hoping you get a ball on the ground but it hasnt been the norm for us normally its been in the gap so that was nice for us
7751477 we have information about death of three persons in raikia area the details are being collected
7751478 the situation in kandhamal district is very tense but under control
7751479 i think we have another nuclear agreement in the queue ahead of that russian deal that were really focused on right now and thats the india civil nuclear agreement and thats generating a lot of work and time and energy on our part to get that done
7751480 we were able to work that through the iaea and now working with the nsg and trying to get that through nsg and eventually for presentation to our congress
7751481 blogurile au jucat un rol foarte important in campania lui barack obama deoarece grupurile progresiste din jurul lui au folosit internetul ca pe un mijloc de organizare dar si ca pe un mod de a transmite informatiile catre cei mai activi votanti

7751586 our defense got three extra outs which was nice because it gave dallas another inning
7751587 he got a whole innings worth of outs on the bases it was a heck of a job by him and the defense
7751588 as a staff we really try to stress that and give us every opportunity to get outs any way we can
7751589 as a guy whos not going to light up the radar gun you look for outs in other ways when youre struggling or even when youre going good one of the facets of my game i like to practice is controlling the running game and giving zuke a chance to throw a guy out when he does decide to take off
7751590 i mean nobody wants to be in a hole right out of the gate especially against these guys what are they 148 2 something like that its ridiculous you know that when they get guys on theyre going to get them over and get them in so you try to minimize that it was real good getting out of that without a blemish
7751591 if he runs through second with aggressiveness hes going to make it to third he was reading the play it took a perfect throw but still erick has to run hard to have a chance when he got around the bag he turned it on but obviously it was a step too late
7751592 everybody in the world knows hes going to run and hes usually successful
7751593 so doing a good job of holding that guy on controlling him on the bases and not letting him wreak havoc on the infield is real important
7751594 i was happy about the way i was attacking the strike zone and pitching to contact
7751595 before i was a guy who wanted to light up the ks but now im a guy who really just tries to let the defense do their job
7751596 i think his confidence is going up each time he goes out there his velocity might be up just a tick from last year and hes got a better feel for his changeup

7751627 i hope everybody has an open heart and an open mind in this campaign
7751628 i read your blog post probably thought no one read them huh and im writing this to you because i want to encourage you to follow your heart and go back to paris since the first year i met you the biggest thing i have admired in you is your willingness to go outside the average ordinary life and seek a more adventurous path that will lead you to happiness and success on top of keeping your grades up you were involved in clubs and played basketball as well as working sometimes more than one job and staying social now youre at smu a fantastic college and you are there because of your hard work and because of your hard earned money although paris will not be fresh and new like the first time you will still be outside of your comfort zone which seems to allow you to thrive and learn about yourself and what you want in life and from others as well you will be leaving behind a ton of friends who will miss you but will ultimately be excited for you and your latest adventure as far as monte you said it yourself three whole years yall are the perfect combination and pick up where the other person may be lacking he may be extremely upset or sad that you may leave again but i really believe that whats meant to be in life will happen you and monte can find ways to continue making the relationship work and maybe things will be even better and stronger between yall when you come back as they were the last time really i just want to take advantage of this amazing opportunity to go back to paris because i know many people including myself would not you could stay at smu and continue making memories with your friends but paris has so much more to offer as far as soul searching and providing you with new insight you have never taken the easy way out you have always worked hard and dedicated everything to something youve really wanted and youve gained success as well as my admiration and pride in being your friend because of it whether you stay or whether you return back know that the people in your life who truly care about you will always be there for you even if you are a little further away then desired

7751670 i think to us these are our biggest games all year
7751671 one out of two would be good getting both would put us where we need to be right now lose two and were going on a road trip trying to pick our heads up
7751672 usually its been a cubs cardinals rivalry here thats been the biggest rivalry in the division
7751673 you look at the proximity of the teams and that allows for milwaukee to have the same thing with chicago and st louis but we havent done our part we havent been competitive until recently now youre starting to see what happens when all three teams are
7751674 we had a chance in three games and we just didnt close them out
7751675 its definitely going to be a little more intense thats for sure
7751676 were playing better now than when they came in the last time our bullpen is set up differently now
7751677 the biggest thing is that this two game series will not determine october chances for either club
7751678 its a two game series its more important to us than it is to them because they are ahead of us but whatever happens it will not determine our chances
7751679 wed like to win both of these games against milwaukee and you have to win the series so lets sweep them
7751680 i have to come out and try to perform better than i did last year
7751681 it doesnt mean you have to top the stats you did last year to become a better player
7751682 youve got to know if the cornerback is playing outside leverage inside leverage man to man press off man you have to know how to run a certain route against that
7751683 thats one thing i really worked on how to get open when guys are playing you different kinds of ways
7751684 i knew what i needed to work on and in the offseason ive done that
7751685 ive become a more polished receiver in general i worked on catching the ball every time on running sharper routes on just knowing the coverages better ive done that in the offseason
7751686 hes fundamentally better his work habits are a lot better naturally because its a year later and hes been in the program another year and hes very focused hes turned into a really really really good practice player
7751687 hes doing a lot better finishing his blocks hes got to make sure he runs crisper routes and not rely just on speed
7751688 even though hes not a senior or a captain hes a playmaker
7751689 i told them were capable of doing more than what i was seeing
7751690 i want to do whatever i can for the team to be successful
7751691 obviously i know its possible but thats the farthest thing from my mind right now its team first little me
7751692 just go out and prepare and do the best you can
7751693 and the best you can is probably going to be pretty good
7751694 in the east college football is a cultural exercise on the west coast it is a tourist attraction in the midwest it is cannibalism but in the deep south it is religion and saturday is the holy day
7751695 if you really look at it i think we already have
7751696 the season ticket sales are already out of the roof weve already almost sold out all our home games i think its already on the way there if we have another season like last year who knows the skys the limit
7751697 which all begs a question how can one get access to the village
7751698 barangsiapa yang mempunyai kurma ketika berpuasa hendaklah berbuka dengan kurma
7751699 it seems to be close to 100 percent so hes going to get work a little similar to like were doing with steven jackson well try to accelerate his mental work and his conditioning
7751700 you dont want to come back too early or else theyll be lingering all season
7751701 so im going to get it right so itll be good for the rest of the year
7751702 its definitely frustrating to be away from something you love doing but youve got to see the bigger picture youve got to get back right so that when the time really matters and the team really needs you you can be there for them
7751703 hes not 100 percent hes getting closer but hes been really working hard i bet hes in about as good a running shape as hes been in a long time
7751704 the rotator cuff thats really not bothering me right now its mainly the hole in the tendon
7751705 i was hoping to try to get in a preseason game so i could get my feet wet a little bit but i dont think im going to be able to do it this year
7751706 because all offseason i worked real hard for training camp everybody needs to sharpen their tools so i need to be out there trying to get my techniques down and work on some other stuff to try to continue to get better
7751707 its more about the timing and getting acclimated to the players around you again
7751708 and then obviously the conditioning because you just havent done enough football
7751709 but youd have to keep an eye on them during the game to make sure about conditioning and everything else
7751710 if it doesnt work out that way i feel comfortable with todd johnson back there at safety and also ron bartell being the starting corner
7751711 a great example of what brock can do hes played winning football for us pretty much every week
7751712 im so grateful to coach linehan for bringing me in here and giving me the opportunity
7751713 its a great place to be and im loving every bit of it
7751714 our job is to keep the quarterback clean and open those holes for the running backs
7751715 ive seen the line come together and really play well as a unit
7751716 to go against a team like that and give up no sacks was an outstanding effort
7751717 thats what camps for you grind it out so that were ready for the regular season
7751718 four straight days of some pretty physical work at least on the conditioning side
7751719 we havent been able to play tackle football with him yet but well put the pads on tuesday and keep pushing that
7751720 he had to spend the night in the hospital just as a precaution and to get him on some new medication
7751721 i was surprised because i was thinking i havent started a college game in my life
7751722 last year he was so athletic he was able to make plays
7751723 but mix that with his knowledge of the game and hes going to be something hes one of those linebackers to remember at the university of illinois
7751724 hell be able to tell me after a scrimmage some of the things he did hell come tell me things ill see on tape it means hes into it and paying attention to what hes trying to get done
7751725 the profiles that we look at could make them no 1 draft pick type of kids
7751726 we project that from the time we see kids when theyre 17 18 years old
7751727 i was doing what was asked of me and making plays
7751728 last year about this time i was a special teams guy but i have a more important role because the coaches expect so much more out of me
7751729 i look forward to this game and just proving myself to everyone
7751730 theyve heard through word of mouth about how well the race was run
7751731 that shows how important this race has become in just its second year
7751732 ill really know how my shoulder feels when i start throwing it around and getting contact
7751733 but as far as passing and shooting and stick handling getting bumped its fine it feels like it did at the beginning of last season
7751734 what you do is trust the player but generally they cant be trusted because everybody wants to play quicker
7751735 but we do trust implicitly our doctors when they give the green light for full body contact then hell be ready
7751736 this league is a tough nasty league even exhibition games youve got to make sure youre ready for full battle years ago exhibition games were just a formality now theyre real its our responsibility as an organization to make sure players are 100 percent before they play
7751737 thats when the piece of cartilage fell off and it was floating around
7751738 sometimes it would get caught in there and it would be painful
7751739 nothing i couldnt play through but if it went on long enough it could have developed into a problem
7751740 at the beginning it was a lot of stretching and just getting my range of motion back
7751741 towards the middle part of the summer it was more about getting my strength back doing light weights now my rehab is working out in the gym
7751742 compact it seemed like i had a loose shoulder before now its like having a normal shoulder again
7751743 being back here in the weight room with the guys you really get the itch
7751744 even thinking what the line combinations will be like or the power play or the penalty kill its just fun just to think about that stuff
7751745 we are in tune with the global cues but the fall is lower which is a comforting factor the market believes the measures to control inflation are playing out
7751746 in absence of domestic triggers it is highly probable that we may even see a very choppy stock specific action for todays trade nervousness is likely to creep in again
7751747 finally i have found you ive been waiting for you for years i just want you to know that me and my sister stayed together im sorry i left you and i never got the chance to thank you for your bravery and help so thank you
7751748 wait a minute this is a dream oh man i gotta remember the technique so that when i wake up i can fly
7751749 i dont understand how you can go from making a mistake to losing your life im dumbfounded by it
7751750 there are two sides to every story and the truth is probably somewhere right in the middle
7751751 he was a feisty young fellow popular and wanted to learn english very much he wasnt timid he tried to use it
7751752 it says l e w i s that spells lewis
7751753 in the early part of the session it may trade higher because of the rupee but then go sideways
7751754 everyone knew things were bad for u s financial institutions but with results just over they thought the bad news would probably take longer to filter out
7751755 now it seems as if the market is already feeling the chill of autumn
7751756 stocks are suffering around the world losing out to bonds and some commodities as investors shy away from equity risk
7751757 there are going to be some that will have a lot of turmoil with a romney vice presidency because of his religious views but also because he is not consistent
7751758 im pleased that in this period of economic belt tightening my offices vigilance saved the state from being ripped off by entergy

7751798 she criticized president george w bush and other republicans for presenting offshore drilling as an answer to the recent rise in u s gasoline prices saying expanded drilling would not affect prices for a decade and then only by a small degree i dont think thats a good alternative but if they can prove that it is and they want to pay royalties to the taxpayer then we have something to talk about
7751799 domestic natural gas prices have already plunged 42 percent since early july an even faster drop in price than oil or most other commodities in part because the rapid supply growth has begun to influence the market price spikes remain possible of course but throughout the industry the shale discoveries are causing a shift in thinking about the long term outlook
7751800 ik wilde alles wat met zornik te maken heeft op een leuke manier samenvatten
7751801 de verzamelaar bundelt singles inclusief de nieuwe obscure opnames en b kantjes n een dvd met dertien videoclips die clips zijn belangrijk voor zornik en willen we ook een grote rol geven in de liveshow op 6 december in de ethias arena een show die ook een muzikaal overzicht zal bieden van al die jaren zornik allesbehalve een gewoon concert een rockoptreden maar ook met elementen uit de theatertournee een akoestisch gedeelte en met speciale gasten
7751802 we hebben gefilmd in central park op brooklyn bridge coney island times square chinatown in die clip zullen hints zitten naar vroegere zornikmomenten ook daar vind je die terugblik dus in terug de opnames verliepen vlot al zijn we nmaal aangesproken door de politie onze amerikaanse medewerkers hadden echter het perfecte excuus theyre from belgium they dont know lacht
7751803 geen dance maar wel dansbaar elektronisch en leunend op grooves in februari moet een single uitkomen en in april hopelijk een album
7751804 absoluut niet ik wilde gewoon niet meteen opnieuw een zornikalbum schrijven als we volgend jaar optreden zal het niet vaak zijn nitebytes zal dus op de voorgrond staan maar ondertussen werken we in de achtergrond aan een nieuw zornik album zo houden we onze kopjes fris
7751805 tell me how some son of a carpenter started the worlds largest religion
7751806 the christian god can easily be pictured as virtually the same god as the many ancient gods of past civilizations the christian god is a three headed monster cruel vengeful and capricious if one wishes to know more of this raging three headed beast like god one only needs to look at the caliber of people who say they serve him they are always of two classes fools and hypocrites to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical

7751830 the only similarity between the two stories is a cross in the dirt but it is hardly an unlikely coincidence that there were practicing christians in both russia and vietnam or that in the prisons of those two communist countries the only crosses to be found were etched in the dirt as easily disappeared as the christians who drew them
7751831 but those desperate to discredit senator mccains record will have to impugn his fellow prisoners as well
7751832 it may be typical of the pro obama to disparage a fellow countrymans memory of war from the comfort of moms basement but most americans have the humility and gratitude to respect and learn from the memories of men who suffered on behalf of others
7751833 as swindle said this is a desperate group of people trying to make something out of nothing
7751834 i felt like i was hearing the same rhetoric that id been hearing since the 60s when i started listening to and following political conventions
7751835 i wouldnt take anything away from michelle obamas remarks other than to say that this is an important election this is a big choice for the american people and theyre really going to have to rely on more than a few convention speeches

7751906 its a nostalgic feeling this is one place we have been visiting since our childhood it not only makes up for a great shopping experience but its also a way to relive old memories
7751907 laxmi road was conceptualised and planned by a prominent citizen diwan bahadur godbole in 1912 which was finally completed in 1952 this happens to be the same road that we use today as for the shops some were located there even before the road was named laxmi road more shops began to appear in the later years whereas some shops are quite recent constructions
7751908 dagdusheth halwai was a social worker and a very pious person the road was named after his wife
7751909 my father started the shop in 1942 gandhi was his partners surname since my father was also a freedom fighter the name was more than apt
7751910 we not only have regular customers who have been buying from us for the last 20 years but also the younger generation who have taken a liking to khadi not to forget foreigners for whom getting such material at such a low cost is a novelty
7751911 not only do the malls sell things at an exorbitant price they do have personalised customer services as we have hear we have all our loyal customer base who keep coming to us despite the advent of the malls
7751912 earlier there were smaller shops selling only select items like saris and dress materials now they have expanded and started selling even western clothes among other things
7751913 they have a mind boggling variety of clothes some stores here have turned themselves into mall yet selling stuff cheaper what more do you want
7751914 we also had a jewellery shop which was later closed down but this store remains business is as usual no change
7751915 we have our stalls throughout the year but its during the winter and monsoons that our business sees a rise
7751916 earlier laxmi road was a residential area with old wadas surrounding it but now these are either being pulled down or being encroached upon also there is no parking space which prompts customers to park their vehicles haphazardly making the already congested road worse
7751917 then i hear someone outside one morning and i go outside and see a sign on my door that says theyre auctioning the house
7751918 and families who are very low income feel the costs of having to move even more than other people
7751919 the research shows that there are going to be more waves of these mortgages resetting and people wont be able to make the payments thats going to be devastating for these renters who have been in their homes in some cases for 10 or 15 years

7751921 i took out so many personal loans from friends just to keep paying my bills that for a while i was just hiding in my house

7751969 our administration does a lot of work to raise awareness against these evils among the city residents but many times people living in the suburbs or rural areas remain untouched by such programmes
7751970 therefore our aim is to reach such areas and educate people right at their doorstep through musical dance dramas
7751971 the problems of polythene and drug addiction are deep rooted in rural areas also lack of awareness and low literacy rates are the main problems so our young artistes have prepared two musical dance dramas to create awareness about these serious hazards
7751972 music and dance are substantial ingredients of our plays to attract spectators of all age groups we have performed in various slum areas and villages adjoining chandigarh

7751990 fibersim r is the leading software available to engineer composite products in the aerospace and automotive industries so were confident that we can help vistagy continue to extend its worldwide leadership position we also think vistagys airframe development environments have great appeal in our market because the software enables aerospace engineers to design and manufacture airframes much more efficiently and cost effectively

7751993 i have not got this kind of welcome before all credit goes to the media they supported us all through and it is because of them that people from far off places have come to see us this kind of rapturous welcome no doubt will gives us a lot of encouragement but importantly boxing will get a huge boost

7751995 it is only a matter of time before wolves spread all across northern germany in their move westward
7751996 aside from two large cities berlin and hamburg the region is sparsely settled there are vast areas of woodlands lakes and dark forests
7751997 weasels and otters and raccoons are already well re establishing themselves
7751998 and the european moose elk is poised to move westward indeed elk are already relatively common in the czech republic
7751999 wolves are certainly welcome here as they enrich the local wildlife assortment
7752000 of course if they become a pest hunters will have to go after them to keep their population number in check as we do with red foxes
7752001 they decimate not only mice but also other small mammals and snakes and other egg thieves
7752002 we actually get appeals from residents to kill more foxes
7752003 because they are eliminating too many predators in some nature wildlife preserves
7752004 this is the region where we shall see whether the wolf spreads further westward and if so in what numbers
7752005 the main problem will be the clich of the big bad wolf in the minds of many people wolves can of course be dangerous to humans in certain situations generally when they are backed into a corner but they are generally no threat to humans
7752006 europeans generally are very mindful of the dire effects that humans have had on the environment over the centuries and they are for the most part happy to see the return of bears and wolves and other creatures after near extinction of those species
7752007 as more predators move in the balance of nature returns to normal and we see a reduction in rats and mice and rabbits
7752008 those small creatures form the diet of predators such as the german sea eagle which was the emblem of germany for centuries but which was driven to the verge of extinction by unthinking hunters
7752009 one of our recent accomplishments is in the field of e governance as we have transferred more than 90 percent of civic services to e services and we are aiming for zero visits of customers to the municipal offices which we hope will be accomplished very soon
7752010 with india we will build on the close partnership developed over the past decade
7752011 as two of the worlds great multi ethnic democracies the us and india are natural strategic allies and we must work together to advance our common interests and to combat the common threats of the 21st century
7752012 will pursue effective collaboration on pressing global issues among all the major powers including such newly emerging ones as china india russia brazil nigeria and south africa
7752013 we believe it is in the united states interest that all of these emerging powers and others assume a greater stake in promoting international peace and respect for human rights including through their more constructive participation in key global institutions
7752014 we are committed to us engagement in asia this begins with maintaining strong relationships with allies like japan australia south korea thailand and the philippines and deepening our ties to vital democratic partners like india in order to create a stable and prosperous asia
7752015 we must also forge a more effective framework in asia that goes beyond bilateral agreements occasional summits and ad hoc diplomatic arrangements
7752016 we need an open and inclusive infrastructure with the countries in asia that can promote stability prosperity and human rights and help confront trans national threats
7752017 head on while working with our allies and restoring our standing in the world
7752018 us has interests not just in baghdad but in kandahar and karachi in beijing berlin brasilia and bamako
7752019 it is a strategy that contends with the many disparate forces shaping this century including the fundamentalist challenge to freedom the emergence of new powers like china india russia and a united europe
7752020 its time to engage china on common interests like climate change trade and energy even as we continue to encourage its shift to a more open society and a market based economy and promote greater respect for human rights
7752021 clean energy development must be a central focus in our relationships with major countries in europe and asia
7752022 we need a global response to climate change that includes binding and enforceable commitments to reducing emissions especially for those that pollute the most the united states china india the european union and russia

7752025 the us will continue to stand with the people of georgia and their democracy and support its sovereignty and territorial integrity
7752026 first the slovak orchestra is much better than the beijing orchestra pictured above which suffers from shrill upper string sound
7752027 more to the point the beijing orchestra is using breiners ideas so blatantly that it would be accused of plagiarism if its arrangers submitted their orchestration as original work in any respectable conservatory it isnt just the rockets red glare breiners basic conception of the whole piece has been copied
7752028 we have not heard of naxos rights international breiners publisher which has apparently attempted to discuss the issue with the committee
7752029 all the anthems and songs used at the beijing games were orchestrated by chinese musicians
7752030 my arrangements of public domain anthems are actually original compositions from a legal point of view
7752031 which means if someone wants to record them they have to purchase the material
7752032 the mix of celtic and jewish minds has been a fruitful one aided by windows messenger and skype
7752033 it has taken a lot of time money and effort to get to this stage but we now have a real product to put out there in the radio marketplace celebrate radio has great potential now and although at present we are only available on the internet that will very soon change dons original vision to broadcast on satellite all over the world is still in the pipeline but we fully intend to make it a reality
7752034 in the meantime we are marketing compilation cds of our independent artists syndicating programs to am fm stations in usa and around the world and putting together an aggressive advertising campaign in the us and europe to make the church the jewish community and the wider public aware of the excellence of our product

7752040 joe biden made his second attempt to introduce such legislation
7752041 justice should go ahead now to seek a legislative fix to the digital telephony problem and all parties should prepare to follow through on the encryption problem in about a year success with digital telephony will lock in one major objective we will have a beachhead we can exploit for the encryption fix and the encryption access options can be developed more thoroughly in the meantime

7752043 i drafted a terrorism bill after the oklahoma city bombing and the bill john ashcroft sent up was my bill
7752044 the democratic partys de facto spokesman on the war against terrorism
7752045 states to place social security numbers on drivers licenses and to obtain fingerprints or some other form of biometric identification for licenses
7752046 the fbi could get a wiretap to investigate the mafia but they could not get one to investigate terrorists to put it bluntly that was crazy whats good for the mob should be good for terrorists
7752047 the justice department had the ability to use wiretaps including roving taps in criminal investigations of terrorism just as in other criminal investigations long before the patriot act
7752048 presidents illegal wiretapping program that allows intelligence agencies to eavesdrop on the conversations of americans without a judges approval or congressional authorization or oversight
7752049 i think most americans would be absolutely shocked if they knew what kind of bone chilling information is making its way over the internet
7752050 you can access detailed explicit instructions on how to make and detonate pipe bombs light bulb bombs and even if you can believe it baby food bombs
7752051 the extent to which the first amendment protects such material and its private and commercial distribution
7752052 can withstand constitutional muster in most if not all of its possible applications if such legislation is slightly modified
7752053 have been found in possession of bomb making manuals and internet bomb making information
7752054 what is even worse is that some of these instructions are geared toward kids they tell kids that all the ingredients they need are right in their parents kitchen or laundry cabinets
7752055 we are deeply offended by the gratuitous accusations made against kazaa by witnesses before the committee including ludicrous attempts to associate an extremely beneficial next generation software program with organized criminal gangs and even terrorist organizations

7752060 a vote for obama is a vote for the riaa
7752061 sigh i am serious as anyone else mccain is in some much worse pockets attention to both sides mccain isnt even aware of little plebes like us a vote for obama might be a vote for the riaa but a vote for mccain definitely is the mccain camp has been pulling this junk through the whole campaign taking what mccains knows he will do and trying to get people to fear the obama might do it too a vote for mccain is a vote for fear ive already seen what a guy like mccain can do

7752078 e very now and then the rumor arises that i have a palestinian wife some of my kin were highly amused by a debate on that subject that was being conducted by letters to the editor in their local paper recently
7752079 we had credible inputs that the senior separatist leaders would be targeted by vested interests during the lal chowk march
7752080 hit by a stray bullet after ricochet since it was fired by the security forces distant away from the place where it hit the girl
7752081 the situation is well under control there have been some incidents of curfew defiance by small mobs in some places but srinagar city which had been the centre of violent protests during the last ten days was totally peaceful barring a few incidents of stone pelting by children
7752082 our orders are clear to the deployed security men use of maximum restraint and minimum force
7752083 the curfew was imposed to maintain law and order which will be lifted once it is not required to protect the life and property of the people
7752084 i want to welcome him first the entire family has come the women in our households seldom stir out but tonight they are all here the village was all keyed up preparing for this unforgettable day
7752085 i cannot explain how happy i am to see so many people turning up to receive me this reception is motivational enough for me to work with renewed vigour to win gold next time
7752086 this report expresses the significance of allowing professional and objective representatives of the israeli bar to visit the prisons and insist the prisoners be held under humane conditions
7752087 it made me mad because i didnt even touch the guy
7752088 but sometimes in football they call it one way or the other way it just didnt go our way today i didnt even try to get any information from them because i was so frustrated i dont even know what they said i did
7752089 holy toledo i thought kevin hobbs made a great play on that long ball i couldnt ask him to do it any better i didnt agree with those two officials
7752090 we have one of the tallest receiving corps out there so coach was just trying to take advantage of that
7752091 he handled things very very well and he threw some nice balls
7752092 my wife was having our first child and then there were some complications both for her and our daughter
7752093 its been an up and down ride all year but its been a good roller coaster ride
7752094 we think he could pitch again by saturday or sunday
7752095 then when rosters expand sept 1 we can get him back
7752096 with the giants i asked for my release i didnt see a fit there it wasnt working
7752097 this organization gave me an opportunity to pitch and get to the big leagues which is all i wanted
7752098 it was a good feeling to see beltre hit that ball
7752099 hes hit in bad luck all year and hit two line drives tonight that were caught
7752100 i tell him around the batting cage all the tijme how much he means to us the way he keeps getting after it adrian is banged up but hes physically one of the toughest players ive ever seen play the game after six innings the game went to the bullpens and it stayed close
7752101 when batista pitches like that he can help us whether hes pitching in relief or starting
7752102 just a little tribute to let the jamaicans know we in america are watching and appreciate them
7752103 were hoping that deion branch can get back but you just never know the timing so theyre moving me around
7752104 weve opened up the offense and freed up the younger guys outside it just gives us more of an option from game to game
7752105 i have to find out what the fits going to be he played pretty well
7752106 the only reason i even saw the ball was because kelly jennngs was yelling d d d
7752107 but if i would have saw the ball there is no question i would have scored i am going to get grief for a whole week they gave me grief as soon as i got off the field

7752147 notice you havent seen him with her and she has not been making public statements about him
7752148 to the degree that all of this celebrity glitz and glamour reinforces an emerging negative view of obama which is that he is all glitz and no experience it could be very detrimental
7752149 it was a fabulous moment at the convention celebrity really helps if there is a connection

7752162 he may have the pictures but hes not going to be able to tell you what they mean its just about meaningless without context
7752163 raw crude footage was making it on the internet nevertheless nbc had record numbers what the viewer still wants is context

7752172 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
7752173 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
7752174 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
7752175 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
7752176 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
7752177 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
7752178 well this is the first time i agree with webb im glad hes not mayor too
7752179 its just that the city hasnt enough infrastructure practice or smarts to suddenly accommodate a few tons of wild politicians on the hoof the only stampedes this place knows from are the four legged variety in terms of staging a giant convention nobody here knows his ass from his steer but lets not talk about the food bull meatball i reached for one interesting looking hors doeuvre what is it i asked fried bull testicle the server said i went for the celery stick

7752182 the issue of poverty has replaced gay marriage as a galvanizing issue for christians
7752183 i would say the issue of poverty has replaced gay marriage as a galvanizing issue for christians
7752184 now the religious issues include climate change darfur and the war in iraq
7752185 the new generation will no longer be in the political pocket of any party theyre not going to be delivered to anybody
7752186 a lot of evangelicals are leaving the religious right and the republican party in droves theyre going to go with who speaks to their issues
7752187 i would not say there is an organized religious left like the christian coalition
7752188 savvy marketing and public relations theyve done a very good job of marketing themselves but the moral majority is certainly not the majority
7752189 the religious right was meeting a dynamic spiritual hunger in a lot of people a hunger for values a spiritual connection with the sublime
7752190 the left abandoned that and the right was able to meet that hunger
7752191 often the religious debate has been around a few divisive issues and we feel that doesnt represent the values held in common by people of faith poverty immigration reform human rights economic issues
7752192 gold honey mustard you can do these colors in lightweight fabrics so its a head start on fall without the bulk
7752193 think about it for a skirt or pants like khaki you can wear it with chocolate brown or olive green on top
7752194 its sort of like an oxidized metal color at night its sort of a new way to wear gold
7752195 you could see this on very fair skin but also you could see it on jennifer lopez or mary j blige
7752196 i think its good in small doses i dont think you want to invest in a coat of this color
7752197 its a flattering color on every woman its not a color i think youre going to want for an evening situation but it will look great in the daytime
7752198 youre going to see a lot of melding of all these colors especially a glen plaid or a check they work like the solid thats not a solid a good investment piece isnt always black pants or a white dress
7752199 the woman who is wearing mustard is bold and wants to be a trendsetter
7752200 with your makeup your best bet is to keep it matte matte makeup with matte fabrics
7752201 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
7752202 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
7752203 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
7752204 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
7752205 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
7752206 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
7752207 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
7752208 who are open to doing something on the production side
7752209 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
7752210 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
7752211 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
7752212 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
7752213 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
7752214 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
7752215 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
7752216 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
7752217 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
7752218 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
7752219 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
7752220 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
7752221 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
7752222 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
7752223 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
7752224 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
7752225 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
7752226 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
7752227 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
7752228 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
7752229 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
7752230 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
7752231 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
7752232 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
7752233 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
7752234 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
7752235 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
7752236 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
7752237 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
7752238 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
7752239 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
7752240 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
7752241 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
7752242 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
7752243 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
7752244 till now we have embarked all of the companys campaigns in the south through our in house division but our expansion strategy for an pan india presence requires an creative agency as it becomes difficult to suite the palate of various customers we have aggressive expansion plans nationwide and in the marketing strategy the company will present what and how its service will be different from the rest
7752245 we have not received any official intimation as yet we shall respond in an appropriate manner as and when we receive it
7752246 the consumer should be able to use any service dth cas or iptv at the same price however for broadcasters iptv players are small operators and their intent to support rollout of these services is low
7752247 iptv players still dont have the ability to negotiate with broadcasters over pricing
7752248 we are following trais directive on pricing and have signed agreements with telcos there is no problem
7752249 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
7752250 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
7752251 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
7752252 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
7752253 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
7752254 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
7752255 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
7752256 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
7752257 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
7752258 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
7752259 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
7752260 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
7752261 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
7752262 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
7752263 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
7752264 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
7752265 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
7752266 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
7752267 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
7752268 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
7752269 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
7752270 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
7752271 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
7752272 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
7752273 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
7752274 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
7752275 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
7752276 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
7752277 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
7752278 dont forget you are in the mile high city 5 278 feet above sea level and that means you are 5 278 feet closer to heaven and this is where you will be thursday evening when we nominate barack obama as our presidential nominee
7752279 tony served as special assistant to united states senator joseph r biden jr where he wrote the senators speeches on equality and social justice and coordinated statewide efforts in housing and nonprofit organizational development
7752280 we received credible information that drug cartels in mexico have given permission to hit targets on the u s side of the border
7752281 im pleased that in this period of economic belt tightening my offices vigilance saved the state from being ripped off by entergy
7752282 were going to pay more attention to lighting in the parking areas especially during the night hours
7752283 were looking at also trying to add an important feature to really try to address the request that we have for escort service
7752284 we are considering looking at having students faculty and staff to wear their ids in visible places though weve not made that concrete
7752285 i think at first some students were like wait were doing what exactly but a lot of them were interested in the recycling and the going green aspect of it
7752286 all of them may not necessarily be excited but it definitely brings an awareness of how we need to be a little more eco friendly
7752287 the idea there was to get the bins into the rooms before students moved in that way it would be a new cultural development tool
7752288 a new student comes in heres the recycling can theres a sticker on it that explains the program they know what can and cant go in the can and oh this is what southern miss does
7752289 it just so happened that larry was just getting started and he mentioned that he was going to have recycling bins that needed to go out to buildings on campus as part of the universitys initiative to go green so we hopped on board
7752290 mississippi has a structure heavy in manufacturing particularly low wage jobs which for competitive reasons have been lost
7752291 mississippi also has a relatively lower educational level and the lower the educational attainment the higher the probability you will lose your job in a weak economy so our structure and workforce relatively speaking put us at a greater risk in a business cycle
7752292 people need to learn about the candidates and see who relates to them
7752293 i look forward to the time in america when i can afford health insurance for my wife
7752294 if mccain cant win over the moral majority they may stay home
7752295 then obama might have a chance in mississippi but its not likely
7752296 we were just going through our routines running defense offense i heard he took a pop he took a play out got himself back in finished the practice
7752297 we kind of got in a huddle talked about it
7752298 i dont think ive had a game winning walk off home run its kind of cool
7752299 at this moment the next big story in technology may reside on
7752300 ever since we began closing down some of the access roads to parts of campus the location of the visitors booth where it used to be made it difficult to easily direct visitors to all parts of campus because once they got there because of construction and road routes and one way roads it made it difficult to easily get them there
7752301 so we had known for some time that we needed to relocate the visitors booth to the south side of east memorial where they turn in and its really helped because we can identify the visitors who are coming to campus before they get to an area where its hard to get out where they really dont need to be and we can now easily direct them where they actually need to go
7752302 they may think a base tan will protect them from skin cancer but in reality the lights just act as a radiation multiplier further increasing their skin cancer risk
7752303 ive seen a lot we have a lot of young girls a lot of freshman on the team and i think they are all doing really well right now

7752305 both of our seniors have a lot of experience and the ability to be leaders for us out there
7752306 and they really have been in the early part of the season
7752307 there are so many people to thank for making the vision become a reality

7752313 our family has been playing mexican mariachi music for 125 years she grew up singing mexican songs but theres another side to her
7752314 melody is a reflection of how shes grown up here in the states and shes now going from singing mariachi to pop which is pretty cool
7752315 she knows how hard it can be and all the pressures and influences and just how sexual this generation is
7752316 but there arent any suggestive lyrics theyre just fun clean songs im very proud of melody

7752491 i rapporti dicono che si avvicinata ai poliziotti iracheni affermando di indossare la veste e di non voler andare fino in fondo
7752492 se sia stata costretta a indossarla o se labbia fatto volontariamente ancora da verificare

7752494 moderate to heavy rain will be possible across portions of central north carolina through mid to late week
7752495 on wednesday as we get a cold front settling south from the virginia north carolina line there could be showers right near that front that could spin up and produce a tornado
7752496 as we get farther to the west as some runoff takes place there could be some flooding in the western part of the state
7752497 he was able to basically clean out her accounts prior to the murder
7752498 the beating around her head was so severe that she was basically unrecognizable

7752506 well be back very very soon in north carolina on the air
7752507 you know i think if i were edwards i might give up a haircut or two and refund at least you know the people that gave the 50 or 100 200 items because if they had known the facts they wouldnt have sent him the money and he was the guy that didnt give them the facts
7752508 i mean he knew that in effect he would not be elected president
7752509 ive seen a lot of class action suits with less to it than this particular case
7752510 the facts are clear he solicited money and he wasnt telling the truth to people he was soliciting it from
7752511 i would have to think that a bumper sticker that said obama the other edwards might have been a bit difficult
7752512 its really not an issue whether they get a permit
7752513 it is an issue of what are going to be the conditions of the permit
7752514 i guess at this point were trying to determine the best course of action to move it forward
7752515 i think theres certainly a better understanding as to whats needed and what the process would be to allow the jetty to remain
7752516 my client has cooperated with authorities consistent with our plea agreement

7752519 and that he had an answer for that but he would save it
7752520 he advised that he beat the expletive deleted out of his opponents and it did not matter when he disclosed those campaign reports

7752522 we are now controlling most of the key government offices to prevent them from coming to work
7752523 today we declare a long long holiday for the government

7752525 russias historic role of the guarantor of peace in the caucasus has increased

7752530 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7752531 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7752532 maybe a little experience came through for me at 4 all in the last set
7752533 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7752534 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7752535 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7752536 we reviewed all the medical records and spoke with the victims physician and the evidence showed that the loss of the fetus was not related to or a result of the crash caused by the defendant

7752541 the farther you go the more you become convinced youve got somebody special
7752542 moving up to this car now its more pressure but i can handle it
7752543 there were other options but i think for the long term and whats in the best interest of jgr the home depot and our whole team joey was the guy

7752549 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7752550 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7752551 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7752552 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7752553 what happened is that monday morning when the plane carrying the body of the late zambian president levy patrick mwanawasa arrived at the chipata airport and the former first lady was on the same aircraft when she disembarked and went to the tent where the other dignitaries were mr sata kneeled before her to greet her but she told him she did not want to politicize the funeral she therefore asked him to leave the procession when mr sata tried to explain why he was there the former first lady interjected and said that she did not want to talk to him
7752554 in fact the national chairman of the governing movement for multiparty democracy mmd mr michael mabenga was there and also demanded that mr sata should be removed immediately and he asked the minister of science and technology to ensure that he mobilize the police to send mr sata off
7752555 in the african tradition that should not be the case because in fact you do not even need an invitation card to attend a funeral procession this was a bit awkward
7752556 the first lady acknowledged this but in her statement she even told mr sata that you reconciled with president mwanawasa but you did not reconcile with me and the family and the family does not want your reconciliation
7752557 there was a time when mr sata accused the first lady of being disrespectful and advised that a marriage counselor should counsel her to teach her how to respect other people recently when the president was in paris in hospital mr sata called on a medical team to go and ascertain his capability of continuing as president that shows the differences that have been there between him and the first lady perhaps the first lady has been harboring that grudge against mr sata
7752558 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7752559 pakistans leadership has clearly stated their commitment to pursuing and eliminating terrorism and securing pakistans borders for the benefit of its own citizens
7752560 our organization is neither registered nor do we have any bank accounts
7752561 we therefore feel that these repeated defaults and violations have forced us to withdraw our support from the ruling coalition and sit on the opposition benches
7752562 human remains which rescuers gathered into 65 bags are almost impossible to identify unfortunately kyrgyzstan does not have a special service and equipment to make dna analysis and iran offered help
7752563 one does not have to explain the emotional state of the victims relatives so we must conduct dna tests identify bodies and hand them over to the victimss families as quickly as possible
7752564 but to rule out mistakes we decided to send those bodies to tehran for dna testing too
7752565 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7752566 natos mission is based on a un mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7752567 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7752568 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7752569 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7752570 first time naming sumali sa ganito kalaking contest nagbunga rin ang pagpa practice namin its our first time to join in a big competition like this our practice paid off
7752571 iba talaga ang pinoy kahit saan makarating nananalo sa mga contests na sinasalihan pinoys are really different wherever they go they win in contests they join in
7752572 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7752573 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7752574 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7752575 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7752576 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7752577 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7752578 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7752579 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7752580 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7752581 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7752582 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7752583 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7752584 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7752585 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7752586 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7752587 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7752588 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7752589 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7752590 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

7752595 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7752596 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7752597 we have taken this decision after we failed to find any ray of hope and none of the commitments made to us were fulfilled
7752598 we are sad over nawaz sharifs decision we want to move together and solve the problems facing the nation
7752599 we will request nawaz sharif to return to the government

7752609 we are here today to show the government that the thai people dont need them we want the government to step down
7752610 as of now the prime minister has not made any change therefore i still think that the cabinet meeting will go ahead
7752611 i stand here today at the cross currents of that history knowing that my piece of the american dream is a blessing hard won by those who came before me
7752612 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7752613 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7752614 this november the torch will be passed again to a new generation of americans so with barack obama and for you and me our country will be committed to his cause
7752615 the work will begin anew the hope will rise again and the dream lives on
7752616 let there be no mistake about it we are united
7752617 hillary wants us to support obama the same we supported her and thats what we are going to do
7752618 the mix of celtic and jewish minds has been a fruitful one aided by windows messenger and skype
7752619 it has taken a lot of time money and effort to get to this stage but we now have a real product to put out there in the radio marketplace celebrate radio has great potential now and although at present we are only available on the internet that will very soon change dons original vision to broadcast on satellite all over the world is still in the pipeline but we fully intend to make it a reality
7752620 in the meantime we are marketing compilation cds of our independent artists syndicating programs to am fm stations in usa and around the world and putting together an aggressive advertising campaign in the us and europe to make the church the jewish community and the wider public aware of the excellence of our product

7752652 sa kutob ko po bilang magulang may gumawa ng di maganda sa anak ko di po gagawin ng anak ko iyan magpakamatay my intuition as a mother says that somebody did something terrible to my daughter my daughter would never commit suicide
7752653 pero ano ibig sabihin nung mga pasa pasa but what do the bruises mean
7752654 its not normal that seven filipinos would commit suicide in eight months we want the philippine authorities in the uae to find out why they are committing suicide
7752655 we dont know whether they were accidents suicides or foul play
7752656 suicides can happen to anybody regardless of religion and culture its a persons own decision
7752657 hindi buong body parts of the body these are not intact bodies but body parts
7752658 di na recognize ng tao dahil umuulan many could not recognize it because it was raining
7752659 we lost contact with the plane 10 minutes after take off the aircraft most probably crashed we are concentrating our search within a 20 mile radius in davao city several aircraft are also involved in the search
7752660 misuari is facing charges of rebellion while trillanes is facing a charge of attempted coup detat both non bailable offenses and yet in the case of the former armm governor the government has looked the other way around and allowed him to roam around
7752661 and yet trillanes is being treated differently from the governments treatment of nur misuari
7752662 under the circumstances a double standard of justice for which the government is responsible appears to be harshly and unconstitutionally applied to sen trillanes in the refusal to grant his petition to attend and participate in the sessions of the senate and its committee meetings and hearings
7752663 hindi buong body parts of the body these are not intact bodies but body parts
7752664 di na recognize ng tao dahil umuulan many could not recognize it because it was raining

7752667 they the us are now helping us in the search operations by this time one of their long range patrol aircraft is already helping us
7752668 yan ang pinagtatakahan namin kasi we could not think on some lapses on the part of the pilot that they were not able to control the aircraft
7752669 we could not think of the possibility that the pilot could not correct at that particular time especially that it was only a lost of radio contact or probably electrical failure so these are very normal occurrences that we can even fly to the next destination even without contact on the ground
7752670 it is very unusual why we cannot find any trace up to now we have not actually experienced this kind of an incident or accident
7752671 it will be so hard for us to accept the fact that our comrades are gone although we are always ready to sacrifice our lives for country for god and people
7752672 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum
7752673 here are few more useful options sometimes amount of traffic that goes in and out of your computer is very high while all you want to see is just few packets often you want to see who sends you the traffic but when you try to capture anything with tcpdump it dumps so many packets that you cannot understand anything this is the case when c command line switch becomes handy
7752674 the military will not stage a coup detat the public must not panic and must carry on their daily lives the army will not get involved in politics
7752675 now we have completely taken over nbt and i want more people to join them

7752677 pad have seized nbt to cut off the government communication now up to 3 000 people have occupied nbt and they plan to do their own broadcast
7752678 they cannot claim their right to rally under the constitution because armed protesters intruded into a state office
7752679 as of now the prime minister has not made any change therefore i still think that the cabinet meeting will go ahead

7752717 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
7752718 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
7752719 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

7752784 despite the confusion and violence of events in chicago it felt like being in the right place at the right time
7752785 the lines had been drawn we were doing something important
7752786 i think people figured if these guys cant run a convention without battling each other in the street and on the floor of the convention hall how the hell can they run the country
7752787 had there been party leaders who had a major role in choosing the nominee this year it is probably much more likely it would have been a hillary clinton rather than a young barack obama
7752788 in a sense going to chicago was a fitting way for me to start my time in ann arbor
7752789 these days its fashionable to make fun of baby boomers and regard the hippies and protesters of the 60s and early 70s as marginal and futile
7752790 i really think that the things we were there standing up for were important we really did believe things could get better and should get better
7752791 my belief is that you must light a candle to make the world around you a little lighter but you must also curse the darkness by speaking up to the powers that be

7752807 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did
7752808 the people gathered together that day were ordinary folks doing the best they could to build a good life they were parents living paycheck to paycheck grandparents trying to get by on a fixed income men frustrated that they couldnt support their families after their jobs disappeared

7752835 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation

7752840 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development

7752852 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7752853 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7752854 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7752855 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7752856 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7752857 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
7752858 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7752859 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7752860 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7752861 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7752862 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7752863 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7752864 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7752865 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7752866 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7752867 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7752868 te ha empujado desde lo oscuro hasta un deseo tan vasto como tu historia te aferra entre sus garras duermes la mitad de la vida y corres lo que falta te cepillas los dientes te cortas las u as te portas bien a veces los huesos crujen contra la carne la piel se consume y algo asciende a la superficie
7752869 the deal looks very good from a long term perspective
7752870 the deal is certainly not cheap but its not highlyexpensive as well given the kind of synergies that infosys willget
7752871 this will give much better returns on thecash they were sitting on for a long time
7752872 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7752873 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7752874 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7752875 we hope that fans of the worlds most popular board game will enjoy buying selling and trading real estate from around the globe in the new monopoly game that they created with their votes
7752876 we are thrilled that the first ever global game board includes an interesting mix of cities that showcases the dynamic cultures sights and history of the planet
7752877 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7752878 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7752879 caring for the least among us each and every day
7752880 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlookremains positive
7752881 while the equity markets are currently focused on downsiderisks we believe there are potential offsets on the upsidebased on continued strength in commodity demand low inventorylevels and a supply side which continues to face multipleconstraints
7752882 the groups performance in the first half together withour growth potential supports the boards view that rio tintopresents a very strong standalone value proposition forshareholders
7752883 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7752884 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7752885 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7752886 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7752887 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7752888 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7752889 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7752890 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7752891 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7752892 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7752893 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7752894 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7752895 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7752896 as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7752897 i would say that as an ardent practicing catholic this is an issue that i have studied for a long time and what i know is over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition st augustine said at three months we dont know the point is is that it shouldnt have an impact on the womans right to choose
7752898 the christian tradition from the earliest days reveals a firm antiabortion attitude the condemnation of abortion did not depend on and was not limited in any way by theories regarding the time of fetal animation even during the many centuries when church penal and penitential practice was based on the theory of delayed animation the condemnation of abortion was never affected by it whatever one would want to hold about the time of animation or when the fetus became a human being in the strict sense of the term abortion from the time of conception was considered wrong and the time of animation was never looked on as a moral dividing line between permissible and impermissible abortion
7752899 destruction of the embryo in the mothers womb is a violation of the right to live which god has bestowed on this nascent life to raise the question whether we are here concerned already with a human being or not is merely to confuse the issue the simple fact is that god certainly intended tocreate a human being and that this nascent human being has been deliberately deprived of his life and that is nothing but murder
7752900 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7752901 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7752902 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7752903 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

7752920 during everyday life we constantly evaluate social behaviour and this largely affects how we feel about ourselves and other people
7752921 but the way we store and use information about our own and other peoples social behaviour are not well understood
7752922 this latest study used functional brain imaging to identify the circuits in the brain that underpin our ability to differentiate social behaviour that conforms to our values from behaviour that does not
7752923 the most distinctive feature of depressive disorders is an exaggerated negative attitude to oneself which is typically accompanied by feelings of guilt
7752924 now that we understand how the brains of healthy individuals respond to feelings of guilt we hope to be able to better understand why and where there are differences in brain activity in people suffering from or prone to depression
7752925 the brain region we have identified to be associated with proneness to guilt has been shown to be abnormally active in patients with severe depression in several previous studies but until now its involvement in guilt had been unknown
7752926 by translating these basic cognitive neuroscience insights into clinical research we now have the potential to discover new key functional anatomical characteristics of the brain that may lie behind depressive disorders
7752927 the results will hopefully make an important contribution to our understanding of the causes of depression that will ultimately allow new approaches to find better treatments and prevention

7752940 to me jodys been the second half mvp no doubt about it
7752941 hes carried us hitting in the leadoff spot and now hes hitting third coming up with some big hits no different from what weve seen all year
7752942 was it seven i dont know what it was but it was tough
7752943 its a struggle to get through things like that at some point you know things are going to change for you its just good that it was in dramatic fashion and we can go home happy tonight
7752944 hes just another righty reliever to me i dont particularly see him that well but i got a good cut
7752945 i cant imagine anyone saying they walk into the batters box and feel comfortable against a guy like that
7752946 jody was great in spring training didnt really have much of an opportunity early they gave it to other guys

7752987 metlife has been a very good company for us and has essentially allowed rgas management team to run the company in the way it sees fit
7752988 we downgraded the stock because it had really peaked out
7752989 we thought the stock got a little bit ahead of itself
7752990 i think if you look at the companys past performance and the earnings i dont think its stock is overpriced

7752996 everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7752997 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline
7752998 the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7752999 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7753000 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7753001 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work
7753002 if a company is doing badly then you blame the managing director so it is right and fair that the coach be held responsible

7753008 mofaz already has an impressive resum and has succeeded in many positions usually reserved for ashkenazim he became one of only a handful of non european chief of staffs in the idf with the first being moshe levi in 1983 a full 35 years after the founding of the state
7753009 unlike many prominent sephardi politicians such as amir peretz david levy and aryeh deri mofaz is not known for being concerned with social and economic affairs he has only held the transportation and defense portfolios in the government
7753010 as a result although considered hawkish mofaz has not become identified with sephardi politics
7753011 we are not witnessing any backlash and cries of discrimination when mofaz is attacked in the press and by fellow politicians the way we witnessed it when binyamin ben eliezer and amir peretz ran for leadership of the labor party
7753012 indeed the ethnic demon has been the decisive factor in almost every election from the riots in wadi salib in haifa in the 1950s the black panthers of the 1970s and dudu topazs
7753013 apart from receiving the blessing of shas spiritual mentor rav ovadia yosef which is given to all who seek it mofaz has not sought nor received much of the sephardi vote
7753014 this is largely because kadima members who will decide the outcome of the race do not appear to have much of an obvious sephardi agenda
7753015 the upcoming kadima race is being compared to the race between the us democratic presidential candidates with livni compared to hillary clinton and mofaz in the guise of barack obama
7753016 obamas campaign has been clouded with references to the skin color of the senator from illinois whether used as a weapon or as a deflective measure obama relates to his ethnicity constantly on the campaign trail in contrast mofazs ethnicity has hardly been alluded to
7753017 the simplest explanation for this could be that israeli society has matured and is ready for an ethnic prime minister however recent barbs at peretz and ben eliezer prove that this is far from true
7753018 ben eliezer was frequently pejoratively referred to as fuad similar to those who include the middle name hussein when referring to barack obama
7753019 however mofaz appears not to have suffered thus far in the kadima race for his ethnicity or his skin tone this may have more to do with the nature of the kadima party than anything else

7753041 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew

7753047 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
7753048 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
7753049 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
7753050 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
7753051 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
7753052 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
7753053 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
7753054 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
7753055 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
7753056 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing

7753061 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
7753062 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
7753063 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise

7753070 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really

7753072 the trip gives us an opportunity to move forward both here in the u s government and also with our counterparts in europe who want to support georgias economic and military reconstruction

7753074 to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7753075 cheney certainly has had a tougher view on russia than some others in the administration
7753076 would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states as well as the broader international community

7753078 something is really dirty here everything about the governments story smells
7753079 whatever happened to this woman is terrible and its incumbent on us to find out what it was
7753080 as the department of justice has made clear ms siddiqui was not in u s custody before she was detained on july 17 2008
7753081 any suggestion that the cia would imprison her children is wrong and offensive had we known where ms siddiqui was prior to her capture we would have shared that information with our partners in this country and overseas she was a fugitive from american justice
7753082 it looks to me that it would be governor minner unless we go into the january 20 scenario
7753083 if the loser is carney its very easy to see governor minner who has endorsed him as her successor appointing him if he would like that office its a little harder to see if the loser is jack markell
7753084 you dont need just another republican substitute for young and stevens you need a whole new change

7753088 hillary was my first choice but biden was my second choice
7753089 he was one of the best in the debates and hell be a good debater
7753090 to stand with you to change america to restore its future to rise to our best ideals and to elect barack obama president of the united states
7753091 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to
7753092 see thats just not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7753093 we know the momentum can shift and its going to shift starting in denver
7753094 now is the time for barack obama to begin the second wave of this campaign
7753095 a group of three to four militants have infiltrated into the state through kanachak border after cutting the fence and under the cover of firing from pakistan side around 0145 hours
7753096 a massive operation is on to track down the militants in as bsf army and police have cordoned off the entire belt and tracker dogs have been pressed into operation
7753097 pakistan pushed in militants into this side of the border
7753098 when you look at hockey on the tv its always the red wings or pittsburgh playing

7753109 theres a whole bunch of things going on right now and as we begin to move refugees from point a to point b or try to feed refugees who are stuck in pockets around the country were running into the issue of the blowing up of humanitarian vehicles that are trying to get to the refugees so its a whole morass of problems now

7753113 i feel well and the time of kicking a ball is coming playing football this is what makes me happy
7753114 bryan has been around a number of years now and he has been a good defenseman for quite some time
7753115 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a try out it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp anytime you can add a player like him
7753116 james mirtle is good enough to challenge eric at off wing as the best hockey blogger out there
7753117 his performance during this years trade deadline became its own tribe in brazil
7753118 one of my favorite spots on the internet is mirtles site i wont lie guy knows his stuff and is an excellent writer
7753119 mirtle looks like the kind of guy who would like to take you out to a nice dinner and talk hockey to you all night long

7753125 mistrust and resentments continued to boil among top associates of presumptive nominee barack obama and his defeated rival hillary rodham clinton
7753126 one flashpoint is the assigned speech topic for former president bill clinton who is scheduled to speak wednesday night when the convention theme is securing americas future
7753127 the former president is disappointed associates said because he is eager to speak about the economy and more broadly about democratic ideas emphasizing the contrast between the bush years and his own record in the 1990s
7753128 this is an especially sore point for bill clinton people close to him say because among many grievances he has about the campaign obama waged against his wife is a belief that the candidate poor mouthed the political and policy successes of his two terms
7753129 some senior democrats close to obama meanwhile made clear in not for attribution comments that they were equally irked at the clinton operation nearly three months after hillary clinton conceded defeat in the nomination contest these obama partisans complained her team continues to act like she and bill clinton hold leverage
7753130 looking out from this podium tonight i see this diverse assembly of democrats as a testament to the strength and unity of our party and the fruition of our 50 state strategy
7753131 i wish he could raise more money that would help us but i have to say his 50 state strategy turned out to be just what we needed
7753132 the problem was not his concept the concept has been vindicated
7753133 it doesnt make sense to pick 30 states and say this is where were going to spend our money you dont know whats going to happen
7753134 i can tell you there are a whole number of congressional seats that are competitive today because howard took a national strategy
7753135 virginia certainly has benefited from his strategy i think he deserves a lot of credit frankly
7753136 oh beautiful for patriot dreams that sees beyond the years
7753137 hes got to kick butt a little more about it

7753141 we spent an enormous amount of money and time and a full time unit of people looking under every stone it wasnt like we did not know anything about her
7753142 and we thought her position on this was pretty reasonable
7753143 saves that network from slapping on a bumper sticker barack obama could cure cancer and theyd figure out a way to frame it as an economic disaster
7753144 i dont think hes being passed off as a sage
7753145 but being out of touch with mainstream america is nothing new to jon as evidenced by the crash and burn ratings of this years oscars telecast
7753146 that false sense of urgency they create the sense that everything is breaking news the 24 hour networks are now driving the narratives and everyone else is playing catch up
7753147 that colors your vision of them so clearly and so profoundly
7753148 i dont say access is useless but the more you get sucked into it the more you become part of that machinery
7753149 liberal bias and not wanting to be racist they want him to win badly and yet dont like black people
7753150 an age joke about mccain is at this point somewhat meaningless because its already trite
7753151 he knows were there to introduce him to 20 year olds smoking out of apple bongs
7753152 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7753153 who put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7753154 i have never had someone inspire me the way people tell me my father inspired them but i do now barack obama
7753155 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world
7753156 he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation
7753157 even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7753158 he was raised by grandparents who were working class folks just like my parents and by a single mother who struggled to pay the bills just like we did and like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7753159 i would also like to express my gratitude to roman abramovich for all his help and encouragement
7753160 it was unfortunate i suffered a number of injuries during my time here but i always gave my all whatever the circumstances
7753161 they are still so strong that i can see them and
7753162 they will probably meet again in a repeat of the champions league final too i shouldnt wonder liverpool have it all on to finish above them
7753163 chelsea were very strong last week and united will be even stronger than they are now if they sign dimitar berbatov from tottenham as i think they will in the next few days
7753164 weve been a good team over the past two seasons and im confident well be a decent team again
7753165 we are a new team with a few players just getting over injuries and once we play a bit more and get to understand each other we will be okay
7753166 it was a bonus win we only drew here last season and we lost the season before that it is never an easy place to come but i thought we played good football
7753167 we had to play a pretty tight midfield unit without much width but it is good we wont slip too far behind what with having no league game next weekend
7753168 if simon doesnt do x hes going to lose he isnt doing x
7753169 blah blah blah im so smart yet i cant observe the obvious that simon is drafting behind two massive dudes nearly this entire run preserving energy for the sprint
7753170 prices were pushed higher by the storm but before we confirm the impact its difficult to know for sure
7753171 the geopolitical tensions between the us and russia and even the eu are going to be a problem
7753172 the issue of surplus oil in the market and the control of prices are among the serious themes of the coming opec meeting
7753173 it appears that opec members plan to prevent the decreasing trend of oil prices

7753178 i would say some people thought we were going to die that is how frightening it was the woman sitting in the seats in front of us was whimpering
7753179 there was a sudden drop in temperature and a rush of cold air you think to yourself god is there a hole in the aircraft it actually felt like someone had opened a door at the back of the aircraft it was incredibly cold
7753180 the next thing the oxygen masks were dropping my highest priority was to get a mask onto my son who was sitting next to me in a bemused and frightened state
7753181 we were descending for about five minutes from what i assume was 30 000 or 40 000ft to 8 000ft as we landed we saw fire engines every quarter of a mile down the runway
7753182 it was obvious to me that there was depressurisation in the cabin but there was no announcement and no evidence of the cabin crew for most of this experience why on earth didnt they give a few more calming words to the passengers
7753183 mine wasnt filling up with oxygen and neither was my sons
7753184 he was hyperventilating i looked at the lady on my left and hers hadnt filled up either
7753185 ryanair confirms that the fr9336 from bristol airport to barcelona girona airport on the evening of august 25 experienced an in flight depressurisation incident which caused the oxygen masks on board to deploy

7753200 these incidents clearly tell us that south africans have lost values and norms of humankind
7753201 we live in a very unjust and unequal society which is very poor and wealthy at the same time
7753202 its desperate times for some people but im sure even the criminals also felt uneasy about their actions but im not condoning this kind of behaviour
7753203 this association is consistent with a large number of studies identifying carcinogens in incense smoke
7753204 and given the widespread and sometimes involuntary exposure to smoke from burning incense these findings carry significant public health implications

7753222 in africa and south america the cattle were shifted slightly to a more north eastern south western direction
7753223 but it is known that the earths magnetic field is much weaker there
7753224 the national capital region ncr including delhi gurgaon and noida is expected to witness flattening trend in rentals over the short to medium term
7753225 however some micro markets with forthcoming supply is likely to experience a margina value correction in the next six months
7753226 however in the immediate future any downward correction in rents is unlikely
7753227 however the outer ring road micro market might see a slight correction in rental values due to the large number of developments scheduled for occupation in the near future
7753228 the widening of the flyover leading to whitefield and an elevated highway to electronics city will connect these micro markets thereby creating fresh demand in the above locations
7753229 hes more of a veteran laid back guy and we play at a different level we like to run we like to do all kinds of things hes a veteran off the bench type of guy thats what he looks like to me and we were looking for something a little different

7753247 islam isnt in america to be equal to any other faiths but to become dominant the koran the muslim book of scripture should be the highest authority in america and islam the only accepted religion on earth

7753267 a lot of people are going to watch that i dont care whats going on that night people are going to be watching that fight its a good chance to get out there and hopefully kick some ass
7753268 if youre to the point where youre fighting the best guys theres no need to go back and fight a tune up fight

7753273 the quake was felt in kota agung in lampung province but we havent received any reports of damage there
7753274 it appears that the parents of a newborn at risk of contracting hepatitis b have not presented their baby for medical treatment
7753275 according to medical advice there is no longer sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of any vaccination
7753276 in economic terms the alliance with lufthansa would be ideal but a lot in this tender will depend on the standing of the buyer the government of austria and on political reasons
7753277 we made the requests via e mail and fax to the youtube office in the united states
7753278 the site has allowed only certain candidates speeches to be viewed freely on the site with which we cannot ensure the fairness of the election
7753279 the interest was great and it is wonderful all the names that were put up
7753280 we have decided that the local indigenous noongar peoples suggestion of wilgi manung is the most suitable i think thats fair enough
7753281 a lot of people go out there and go straight at it the whale like a bull at a gate but if your patient and sit at a distance then the whales will be curious and may head up to you
7753282 the important thing is not to separate the calf from its mother
7753283 there have been a lot of people going out to see the calf but they are doing it the right way by going out with the local operator who is licensed
7753284 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and craig it was the greatest gift a child can receive never doubting for a single minute that youre loved and cherished and have a place in this world and thanks to their faith and hard work we both were able to go on to college
7753285 the most natural way for people to enjoy video is to download it from a server
7753286 we think with the combination of hdmi and analog on a single pci express plug in card at a very affordable 349 will change the lives of thousands of professional videographers
7753287 intensity pros new analog compatibility combined with hd up and down conversion real time processing allows videographers to now edit in either sd or hd while keeping compatibility with older equipment and their archived video footage
7753288 cruel and relentless able to follow a child beyond the school gates and into their homes
7753289 the online harassment of teachers is causing some to consider leaving the profession because of the defamation and humiliation they are forced to suffer
7753290 but there is a wider responsibility upon the providers of the sites which broadcast this material
7753291 these are big companies they have a social and moral obligation to act without the online approval which appeals to the innate insecurities of the bully such sinister activities would have much less attraction i am therefore calling on the providers of these sites to block or remove offensive school videos in the same way as they have commendably cut pornographic content by removing the platform we blunt the appeal
7753292 my father had a volume of unreleased work that nobody knows about from the stax records days and beyond there was often too much material
7753293 there are some good songs and music that can be remixed used for soundtracks samples ringtones so many things and he was working on a new album when he died people will be hearing isaac hayes for many years to come
7753294 a federal court ordered his writers share rights sold for about 30 000 15 000
7753295 he lost millions and it was morally and ethically wrong to take it from him he was devastated every time we met hed ask how much would i have earned this year id always tell him you dont want to know it will make you too sad
7753296 if that means me trying to get my fathers material back im all for it
7753297 i would hope that we can retrieve a good part of what he lost
7753298 my father had a volume of unreleased work that nobody knows about from the stax records days and beyond
7753299 there was often too much material to release at the time but its still great music
7753300 there are some good songs and music that can be remixed used for soundtracks samples ringtones so many things and he was working on a new album when he died people will be hearing isaac hayes for many years to come
7753301 isaac hayes along with james brown remains one of the musicians most extensively sampled by todays hip hop artists
7753302 im very passionate about providing security for the family if that means me trying to get my fathers material back im all for it
7753303 i cant rule out litigation i would hope that we can retrieve a good part of what he lost
7753304 hayes played chef on south park for nine irreverent years during which the show mocked virtually every religious group under the sun
7753305 isaac hayes left south park after an episode of the animated series on comedy central savagely mocked his religion the church of scientology and its most famous follower tom cruise earlier this month comedy central pulled a rerun of the offending episode trapped in the closet after speculation that mr cruise was displeased viacom the parent company of paramount is about to release mr cruises movie mission impossible iii oh and viacom also owns comedy central it looks like two sides are pretty much even yet the creators of south park didnt make fun of viacoms pliability on the premiere of the shows 10th season wednesday night instead matt stone and trey parker reserved their scorn for mr hayes and the church of scientology the episode was entirely devoted to portraying mr hayess character chef as the victim of a sinister brainwashing cult
7753306 as i listen to the arguments about elitists and houses and all this other stuff think about fdr that guys not a regular american nobody wanted to have a beer with him he would have been a terrible president hes an elitist can he bowl somebody could have bowled him i just find it stunning as to where this election is going to be decided or where we allow it to be decided
7753307 i think fox does the best job because probably because they have an idea what theyre doing because they have an editorial perspective theyre able to focus it more so its more cohesive and it makes more sense you understand what theyre doing theyre putting it through a filter
7753308 theyre an appendage of the republican party so theyre putting things through the perspective of getting those candidates elected they say they dont which is i think is brilliant its the most brilliant thing ive ever seen its the biggest f you to people with brains that ive ever seen in my life chris wallace is the only thing that saves that network from literally just slapping a bumper sticker on your television set
7753309 id like to see the 24 hour networks not be given the lead they drive the coverage they drive the themes its as though we are in of mice and men and we say hey lenny why dont you be the leader
7753310 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
7753311 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
7753312 girls and young women need to be protected from their own immaturity and sexual curiousity at that vulnerable age
7753313 prime minister kevin rudd and consumer affairs minister chris bowen must acknowledge the absurdity of grocerychoice and shut the site down immediately
7753314 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7753315 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7753316 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7753317 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores
7753318 what that tells us is that consumers believe it is of no use at all
7753319 the quake was felt in kota agung in lampung province but we havent received any reports of damage there
7753320 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7753321 we shall do all that is possible to save them
7753322 they are besides themselves and feeling helpless but they are trying to stay positive

7753333 they are not going to be intimidated to come into kyle field
7753334 every year they play top teams in the country and they play them really well they are a very well coached team
7753335 their quarterback corey leonard is a heck of a kid and he can throw it and he can run it
7753336 they can hurt you with their option game but they can also throw the ball deep and he has a good group of receivers to throw to
7753337 its going to be a different role than i think i had last year from an offensive perspective
7753338 i think that its real fun to be part of a system like that
7753339 hes throwing the ball great and handling the ball great
7753340 he had the stinger in the shoulder the neck injury and at the same time he had a head injury
7753341 now whether we actually labeled it were so sensitive on how we label head injuries
7753342 we had a lot of new student workers a lot of young student workers that are new to the system still learning the ropes but the majority was people not taking care of their ticket options not registering not taking care of things before hand
7753343 i feel sometimes the students dont realize the resources they have people are unsure of what they can and cant do as far as ticket pull goes
7753344 i dont think students realize that the policies that are put in place for the ticket pull arent decided on by the 12th man foundation he said
7753345 as far as first days go in comparison to previous years and previous football seasons i think it went about the same
7753346 a big thing was group pull because the first game all the fish camps come together so the group line was crazy today too because we had to accommodate all the fish camps but that line goes down a lot over the year
7753347 there are primarily two reasons why students are in that line they have lost their sports card from last year and need to replace it
7753348 we typically get all the freshman at student conferences in the summer and im sure that there are some that dont know or that have forgotten
7753349 weve had this system in place this will be the third year where they can do it online
7753350 it ramadan is a month of increased worhip we try to refine our character and experience a spiritual tune up
7753351 for 29 or 30 days muslims will restrain from anything not pleasing to god
7753352 whether that be like me and starbucks coffee or people who deal with alcohol or smoking its just a cleansing experience
7753353 the idea is that if you can stop these things during ramadan then you can stop them outside ramadan too
7753354 but we know that god has asked us to refrain from them
7753355 it is a really good way to experience what many of those who go hungry experience
7753356 at the end of the day we appreciate the food before us
7753357 i try to remember that i just ate seven to eight hours ago and there are people who havent eaten in days
7753358 it creates a lot of brotherhood and community we have 40 countries represented in msa and were all eating together and talking together
7753359 we go to the rec and we go to the football games we know that were doing something pleasing to god
7753360 we try to refine our character and experience a spiritual tune up
7753361 we create awareness about islam through our events these help break down stereotypes
7753362 theres a lot of ignorance these days about islam so were working to help the community understand
7753363 its something that god has asked us to do and something i can show my appreciation to god with

7753492 progressive meaning that all lines on the screen are presented one after another no gaps this requires twice the data density as the whole picture is shown at a single moment you see this as a crisper picture and enjoy it somewhat more progressive trumps interlaced every time
7753493 it seems like its repeating myself every night but hes just been hitting bad luck all year his numbers dont indicate how good hes hitting the ball
7753494 he hit that ball so hard it looked like at the end it had some topspin like it might kind of not carry as much as it did but fortunately for us it did
7753495 probably one of the most physically toughest players ive ever seen play the game
7753496 i dont like to talk about how im injured or anything like that im good enough to play
7753497 i was happy when i hit the ball but as i turned third i saw everybody waiting for me
7753498 i knew what kind of whoop i was going to get at home im telling you im not going to play tomorrow if my bodys all beat up all the guys beat me really bad

7753536 i had no knowledge of it and i certainly wouldn
7753537 i dont know if it would even work i would never cheat in the game bowlers have used sweat and polish over the years to shine the ball there is an old wives tale from past years that sunscreen and brylcreem helps the ball swing but i dont know about that
7753538 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7753539 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing

7753545 a reply to a democratic alliance da parliamentary question indicates that 42 members of the south african national defence force sandf are currently under suspension on full pay and that a significant number of them have been suspended for more than one year the average length of time for which members are suspended on full pay is more than two years and the south african army appears to be the worst offender two people at rank level 9 for example have been suspended for almost 6 years on full pay the sandf has spent a total of r10 907 429 on suspended members salaries over the past three financial years an average of r3 6m each year this is an astonishing waste of money that could have been better spent on training and equipment which are currently in perilously short supply it is unacceptable that it should take this long for the sandf to process and conclude its disciplinary matters particularly since its suspended members are able to enjoy full remuneration at the governments expense for periods of years rather than months for any member to be suspended for more than a year also indicates that there are serious problems with the effectiveness and efficiency of the military disciplinary system the worst examples of lengthy suspensions in the sandf are member at rank level 13 suspended for 4 years and 2 months member at rank level 12 suspended for 5 years and 9 months member at rank level 12 suspended for 5 years and 8 months member at rank level 10 suspended for 4 years and 10 months and two members at rank level 9 suspended for 5 years and 9 months the da calls for a full review of the military justice system and will be pursuing this matter further at parliament
7753546 the baakens rangers report of july 2008 paints a very good picture of the success of these fine gentlemen and i would like to refer specifically to the report of them accompanying a party from birdlife eastern cape this party was a group of over 50 folk who had attended a beginners birding course at the newton park library on the friday evening and had then attended a practical workshop in settlers park on the saturday morning the course was open to members of the public and was also attended by some bird club members the rangers also attended the course as guests of the club and did very well on the saturday we are sure that they will be able to give added value to their role as rangers and will already be able to assist visitors to settlers park with simple bird identification birdlife eastern cape looks forward to a long and fruitful association with the rangers together with the baakens trust sincerely yours ken amp jen munro convenors of the course

7753589 we are protesting against the presence of an aggressive russian fleet on ukrainian land
7753590 when ukraine prioritises its national interests it goes against russias interests and of course there will be conflict
7753591 and russia has broken through a psychological barrier to start this kind of war on former soviet territory georgia had created itself in the shape of an enemy of russia and many in russia already see us in the same way we probably rank third in the list of russias leading enemies
7753592 in that situation then russia will start playing games start provoking ukraine especially with crimea
7753593 when we think about our position on georgia i have no doubts the loss of sovereignty putting into doubt the territorial integrity of georgia this means revising the sovereignty of all
7753594 there is a reason to be wary in the short term future there is a threat in that ukraine is similar to georgia in terms of what has happened in recent years
7753595 but i find it difficult to think that the threat posed is a military one russia relies on the fact that it has more of an influence over ukraine economically
7753596 if ukraine sorts out its domestic situation and consolidates its foreign policy in terms of european and atlantic integration and this goes at a good pace then we can avoid the south ossetian scenario
7753597 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7753598 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7753599 we dont need an illusion of partnership when they surround us by bases from all sides they drag more and more states into the north atlantic bloc and they tell us dont worry everythings fine of course we dont like that
7753600 its difficult to count them but they say they are deploying at least 20 at each checkpoint and two or three heavy armored vehicles
7753601 we will focus on a concentrated international effort to help georgia to get rid of the russian forces
7753602 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7753603 alarmed by reports of russian plans to recognize abkhazia and south ossetia
7753604 we are hoping to resolve this situation peacefully and if that doesnt work out there are other methods
7753605 i call on russias leadership to meet its commitments and not recognize these separatist regions
7753606 georgias territorial integrity and borders must command the same respect as every other nations including russias
7753607 there continues to be a large presence of russian forces in georgia
7753608 its fair to say that they are still not living up to the terms of the ceasefire agreement
7753609 the vice president will be delivering the word of americas support and also consulting on how these leaders in the region see the future playing out
7753610 thats something that obviously we are going to have to evaluate given the current situation i dont have any announcements on that one way or another
7753611 it is more about him mendis if he bowls a bad ball then punish him and build up pressure on him if you continue to defend him then you know he will also be on top
7753612 it is very important that whenever he bowled a bad bowl we will get runs out of them so that you know he mendis gets under a bit of pressure
7753613 i think s badri nath s effort was great he took on mendis he went for a big shot but that is what you need to do at times to put some pressure on the bowler till now he mendis was never under any sort of pressure so he was bowling at his best
7753614 it is better to have a contributory effort while winning a match but we are not relying on one individual
7753615 if you will have the privilege of getting individual performances like zaheer played well in the last match in this match also he has bowled well but it is always better to win in the sense when it is a team effort and every one enjoys nobody had a bad day it is good overall if we can continue to do this way
7753616 when you are playing with a extra batsman you need to score over 250 runs to put pressure on the opposition team
7753617 so we have to see which bowler is bowling well on a particular day and use him hopefully we will not have a day when all our part time bowlers of them bowl badly and then there is pressure on the skipper
7753618 on these sort of wickets we need to click especially the top order batsmen one out of the three or four batmen has to carry the innings and others can rotate around him then only we can achieve big scores in games like this
7753619 well that was the thought but nothing could be done about it when we could score only 237 runs
7753620 there was a bit of worry for us in the middle because we had to use the 5th bowler which was a part time bowler but yuvraj singh bowled well he was turning the ball and that really worked for us
7753621 of course as we saw in this game that if you have a partnership going and then it becomes very difficult to contain the batsmen the outfields are fast
7753622 the ball comes on even if turns later you can go after the fast bowlers and the spinners so it is very important to have partnership in the middle and save wickets for the death over
7753623 i personally feel that to have a fifth specialist bowler is a luxury
7753624 you can manage with four bowlers provided you have part timers we have seen that part time bowlers like yuvraj singh rohit sharma can bowl raina and virat kohli can also bowl it is always better to play with five bowlers
7753625 i am giving myself a chance i had a different role when i made my debut i was batting at a different slot i had a different role we had a person who would carry on an innings and be there till the end i was among those batsmen who will go out and look to accelerate even if i get out it was okay
7753626 there was transformation from that i am playing for the last four years the later half of my career i was under a bit of pressure to take up the responsibility and play through the innings that is what i am doing
7753627 it is good to have a strike rate of over 90 of course 100 plus strike rate is a dream it is good to have a strike rate of 90
7753628 the crowd is very colorful here so it becomes difficult to spot the bowl till the bowl is new you still see it but once it gets mingled up with dirt and all that it becomes very difficult to spot the ball and at times we see the fielders not really reacting or we see a late reaction it is tough
7753629 but you cannot really do anything about it your concentration level has to be up all the time it is very draining but that is what international cricket is all about
7753630 there are two games remaining we will take one game at a time we will play to win we will try to give our 100 per cent then we will accept the result then we will try to rectify our mistakes and shortcoming
7753631 the genuinely quick have to be preserved and if it means they have to miss a few games it should not bother i have been stressing on the importance of rotating the fast bowlers for a long time now the administrators should take remedial measures quickly on this issue
7753632 in a sense bowlers have become defensive they play more of limited overs cricket where there is nothing much on offer for them remaining tight with line and length is not easy
7753633 at the same time but if they have something in the wicket or conditions they must attack it could backfire a few times yet it is worth the effort
7753634 we have a few bowlers whom i saw last time around and their technique is holding well and those are the first signs of progress and on the others i am seeing for the first time it will take a little longer to judge
7753635 according to the decision of the ioc lyudmila blonska has been removed from the start list for the womens long jump final
7753636 expects russia to abide by its agreement to withdraw forces
7753637 there is no bread there is no food no medicine people are dying
7753638 i cannot go on like this anymore i cry every day
7753639 moving around in the city and looking and searching in different places
7753640 we are waiting for the russians to respect their word
7753641 we waited twice with dashed hopes this time it appears that there is at least the beginning of a fulfillment
7753642 its not they its we who will erase them from the face of earth
7753643 we want everyone to know the truth about the terrible events in tskhinvali with the hope that such a thing will never again happen on our land
7753644 i had a different role when i made my debut i was batting at a different slot we had a person who would carry on an innings and be there till the end i was among those batsmen who will go out and look to accelerate even if i get out it was okay
7753645 theres been a transformation in my career i am playing for the last four years and during the latter half of my career i was under a bit of pressure to take up the responsibility and play through the innings
7753646 the crowd is very colourful here so it becomes difficult to spot the ball
7753647 the first person in the world that talked about the chip issue was me right i issued a
7753648 we know that there are some failures associated to our chips we know its specifically related to a combination of the chip and the specific design of the notebook because of more challenging thermal environment sometimes it will fail most of the notebooks are fine its just that certain notebooks have this problem
7753649 i just sold a chip for 20 and i might have to spend 200 to help repair a notebook nobody has ever done that novellus never done that when it had issues broadcom never done that and they had issues i just dont want the consumers to have to fight the process
7753650 we use an industry standard process how we manufacture the chip is identical to a lot of companies in this particular problem we bought a material that was used to produce billions and billions of chips not millions its just that theres an unhappy circumstance power thermal that kind hit that spot the way i look at it theres no one to blame as it turns out it took a long long time to make it fail it took us months on months on months to figure out a way to make it fail in labs and even now its an extraordinary challenge it just takes a long time its not a functionality problem and its not detectable at shipping its a reliability call that happens on very unique situations
7753651 i wish he concentrates more on cricket aggression is good but it should be on the field
7753652 when you represent the country performance has to be there and i wish he performs on the cricket field
7753653 this is certainly good for the game in india but the proposed suggestion of the candidate retiring at least ten years ago to be a selector is debatable
7753654 we are looking at some technical aspects of the case with the assistance of a british sports medicine and doping expert and we will then file appeal we have sent a formal request to the ipl for a hearing in which we have informed them that the tests had shown traces of different food in the sample as well
7753655 when ukraine prioritises its national interests it goes against russias interests and of course there will be conflict
7753656 and russia has broken through a psychological barrier to start this kind of war on former soviet territory georgia had created itself in the shape of an enemy of russia and many in russia already see us in the same way we probably rank third in the list of russias leading enemies
7753657 in that situation then russia will start playing games start provoking ukraine especially with crimea
7753658 when we think about our position on georgia i have no doubts the loss of sovereignty putting into doubt the territorial integrity of georgia this means revising the sovereignty of all
7753659 there is a reason to be wary in the short term future there is a threat in that ukraine is similar to georgia in terms of what has happened in recent years
7753660 but i find it difficult to think that the threat posed is a military one russia relies on the fact that it has more of an influence over ukraine economically
7753661 if ukraine sorts out its domestic situation and consolidates its foreign policy in terms of european and atlantic integration and this goes at a good pace then we can avoid the south ossetian scenario
7753662 what were all hoping now is the situation in pakistan allows us to go there next year
7753663 the former president musharraf is now resigned and were all hoping the civil situation returns to order
7753664 we havent had a senior australian team in pakistan for a long time
7753665 if the expert advice says its safe we go and were happy to recommend to players that we go
7753666 if the safety and security advice says its not safe then we dont go and our track record speaks for itself on that front
7753667 professional risk assessment says the risk is acceptable in some of those places unfortunately at the moment its not acceptable in pakistan
7753668 we are hoping to play a tri series in south africa with india the indian board president during the teleconference gave us 50 per cent assurance that this might be possible
7753669 we have also spoken to australia that if the south african plan does not materialise we can involve them but we first have to see how the indian board responds because their participation will help boost broadcasters and sponsors interest in such a series
7753670 the postponement of the champions trophy means that all the teams are free next month and i think they can help us out obviously the postponement has been a setback for us in many ways and we need to play cricket
7753671 we wouldnt like to blame anyone we are disappointed that despite our security assurances they didnt listen to us but the problem is that while we had made elaborate security plan for the tournament every team had their own areas of concerns and it was not possible to cater to all of them
7753672 it was agreed by all those on the icc board during its telephone hook up yesterday that if there were any issues relating to scheduling then icc management would work with the relevant members boards to ensure that issues were overcome

7753776 consists of reading a scripture text or passage from a spiritual writer slowly then making some considerations about it trying to understand what god wants to tell us through the text and how to apply it to our lives
7753777 o ften it is advisable to end with a prayer summing up all we have meditated thanking our lord for it and asking him for the grace to put it into practice
7753778 a definite inclination toward silence and solitude the desire to remain quietly in gods presence and second the absence of any desire to apply ones imagination to anything except god
7753779 we need to know how to leave meditation aside when the time comes and obviously it is up to gods wisdom and not us to decide when that is
7753780 even if meditation is not or is no longer the basis of ones mental prayer lectio divina should have a place in everyones spiritual life

7753804 we are entering the post bush era of climate politics
7753805 to his credit sen mccain wants to do something serious about global warming but his proposal falls far short of what the science says we need to do today
7753806 he has not substantively improved his plan over the bill he introduced years ago legislation that the science now shows is out of date
7753807 if the rate should exceed 0 4 c per decade all ecosystems will be quickly destroyed opportunistic species will dominate and the breakdown of biological material will lead to even greater emissions of co2 this will in turn increase the rate of warming

7753833 the militarization of georgia by the u s and its push to admit that country and other border states to nato despite promises not to do so surely fed this conflict and the jingoistic statements of the president and john mccain repeated over and over by an unquestioning media remind me of the lead up to the iraq war with intelligence on the subject in letters to the editor but where is the news analysis the background we so need we should not have to look to the opinion page for that

7753859 thats what made me so mad about it not that i would have had this great play but if i had batted that ball down we would have won the game thats the big issue

7753904 were finding ways to win right now and thats what you want
7753905 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7753906 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7753907 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7753908 it wasnt the best pitch to throw at that time
7753909 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7753910 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs
7753911 we just want to win as many games as we can and finish as well as we can

7753919 i was getting ready for the game and i was kind of feeling it and hoping it would go away
7753920 right before the game i was hitting in the cage and it was just kind of throbbing back there again that needed to be addressed and we were able to do that
7753921 it just turned out to be a little bit of scar tissue and inflammation in the whole side joint area
7753922 it was just inflamed dr robert watkins out in l a was saying theres nothing structurally wrong here your back looks good theres no need for surgery he said the joint was just inflamed and im sure thats what was causing the pain there
7753923 hes going to play today and tomorrow and then after that well see i might give him one day to relax a little bit he looked good he swung the bat good he hit a couple balls good hes going to be out there
7753924 i think the ball coming out of my hand today was a little better i hope to continue to move forward and continue to see improvement we prefer it be a little bit more drastic improvement than what we are seeing but it may be one day it just decides to turn around for us
7753925 ill get him in a headlock for you miss field and cut off his air so hell open his mouth
7753926 i have to marvel at how similar animals and humans can be neither group likes to be forced into anything and try as i might i cant seem to convince him were trudging toward freedom
7753927 well i reckon i could knee him in the chest to make him let go
7753928 your antics are going to get us kicked off the wagon train simon
7753929 he leadeth me beside the still waters he restoreth my soul
7753930 ill take on your watch tonight like we agreed but hickorys getting antsy about having you and your aunt in your own wagon you were last in the row and last to set up camp tonight
7753931 same as every day on this trail i warned you gals i didnt want to take on two women with no menfolk to shoulder the night watches wagons and livestock you know the law of the trail pull your weight or be left behind
7753932 i havent completely mastered the art of unhitching the oxen
7753933 but mr sprouse makes sure our watches arent shirked and you know it
7753934 no call for a man with his own wagon and responsibilities to shoulder yours
7753935 i dont mind taking the extra watch in exchange for their cooking
7753936 youre lagging behind as it is not being able to control your animals is one more hassle to endanger the train one rampaging ox can set off a stampede
7753937 well be ready to pull out at dawn same as everyone else
7753938 let me slice a piece for you to have now while the stew finishes
7753939 when we reach the mountains things will go more slowly
7753940 yep snow can make us lose days get off the trail have so many delays food runs out and animals freeze everythings harder once you hit the rockies
7753941 i hear the mountains are littered with furniture and heirlooms abandoned by travelers so they can get free of a snow bank or make it up a steep pass
7753942 after that rough river crossing we already lost several items
7753943 so we probably wont need to leave anything else behind
7753944 for all those reasons you have to be careful not to get on the trail bosss bad side
7753945 we wont make it without him and hes dead serious about leaving behind anyone who causes problems
7753946 ill clean up and join you in a few moments
7753947 those forceps i ordered should be coming in any day now
7753948 ill make you a rinse of witch hazel to clean it out be sure to drink a lot of water and use the rinse after you eat anything
7753949 though taking things from the ground and putting them in your mouth doesnt help either
7753950 the more you chew the worse itll get keep on and youll see more sores until they spread down your throat and you cant speak
7753951 young and untouched ill give ya a good time sir
7753952 i know a lady who runs a boardinghouse and is in need of some help
7753953 if youre an honest sort and not afraid of solid work you might do
7753954 i sews real what he used to have me do
7753955 youre one of them what purges babes when one of us gets unlucky
7753956 like him that came last night he took the baby right but m sister hasnt stopped bleeding since
7753957 be on yore way sir m sister dont need any more help from no doctors she didnt want the first one to come but he didnt give er no choice
7753958 the quack who did that to her was no doctor
7753959 he said hed take care of us but he turned nancy out within a week after last night he said id have to take her place
7753960 while much has been said of the timing and the scoop by news outlets obamas v p text message still ranks as
7753961 i would like to thank chelsea football club the fans staff players and management for all the support you gave me during my time at the club
7753962 i would also like to express my gratitude to roman abramovich for all his help and encouragement
7753963 it was unfortunate i suffered a number of injuries during my time here but i always gave my all whatever the circumstances
7753964 i really have enjoyed playing in england and have made many friendships that will stay with me forever i will always look back with fond memories of my time at this really great club thank you
7753965 its not true that only silvio berlusconi insisted that andriy return ive put my weight behind the cause too and im happy that in the end weve succeeded in bringing him home
7753966 i think the support structure here is the best that has ever existed in formula one
7753967 they are all devoid of ego so they are not self promoting they are about getting the drivers in the best possible shape at any one time
7753968 it demonstrated to us again how invaluable it is to have that sort of competence
7753969 we had some concerns on saturday morning he was in a lot of pain pretty sore
7753970 but you just do the common sense things on those occasions all the right things from a treatment perspective
7753971 we encourage our drivers not to sleep in air conditioning because it is not good for them at the end of the day you actually sleep better
7753972 as weve all experienced you get cold and its not a good way to look after your muscles
7753973 other than that he had muscle relaxers no sleeping pills also hydrotherapy went to bed early and he felt a lot better on sunday morning
7753974 i dont think exposing any weakness is a good thing to do
7753975 its a little like the chinese hurdler there was nothing to be gained beforehand in telling the world
7753976 when you look at what they did i have a lot of sympathy it was the right approach
7753977 i know that my mum and dad are really proud of me
7753978 they and all the rest of my family are going down to watch
7753979 it is going to be really nice for them as they used to take me everywhere to play games at junior level all over the county really
7753980 ive grown up a little bit now and i can drive myself so its nice to let them have a rest and get a reward for all the hard work they did for me back then
7753981 we went down last year and i really enjoyed it
7753982 its a fantastic stadium but things are going to be a bit different this year i wont be getting the tube in like i did last year or anything like that
7753983 im really excited at the minute but im sure that will turn to nerves by the time the game comes
7753984 i get nervous for some games but for others i dont and im pretty sure that i will for this one
7753985 its just been one of those years for me turning 18 and making my debut and now having the chance to play at wembley
7753986 there have been some injuries all year really and it might be the same on saturday
7753987 but the injuries are what have got me in the team and whilst its bad for the lads i have had to take my chance
7753988 there have been some bad points for the club this season but its been a good one for me
7753989 its something everyone tells me all about but you need to be there to really live it and feel it
7753990 its a special special game for the rangers supporters and i will do everything i can to give them a victory
7753991 we just need to perform well in longer periods of the game not just in 25 minute spells
7753992 he is a different player so he will establish himself in a different way
7753993 jonas has got it in him to be thought of every bit as much as david ginola but in a different way definitely
7753994 he has got so many assets he is not just one thing or two things he has got loads more
7753995 i said a few weeks ago i think the fans are really going to take to him
7753996 but i think the biggest thing they will like about his performance at old trafford wasnt the long runs and the fact that he went past people and kept the ball well it will just be the fact that it meant so much for him to play football and be in a team that wasnt going to be beaten
7753997 if i rest players i will have to call some of you guys in and looking at you i think that would be a big mistake
7753998 im feeling really confident just now regardless of what happened in beijing
7753999 i feel im hitting the ball well i feel mentally strong and physically im not tired so i want to do well here and today was a good start
7754000 i think before you get out on the court there is always maybe more nerves in the first round maybe by the second third fourth rounds you get used to the court
7754001 no one wants to go out in the first round but actually once you get onto the court and you play sort of four five six games you get more comfortable and you relax a little bit
7754002 i was lucky i got off to a good start and calmed down a little bit after that
7754003 i play for myself and i work really hard off the court to try and get the rewards in these tournaments
7754004 in the past i felt nervous coming into the bigger tournaments but now that ive started to work really hard off the court you go into the matches with sort of no excuses no worries
7754005 you just go on the court and just to play tennis and thats one of the few things that im good at its worked out much better for me this year
7754006 i spent about four or five weeks out in florida training
7754007 that means being away from your family for obviously that period of time when you could be at home training in really hot conditions and going in the gym a couple of times a day its a complete waste of time going on the court and finding reasons why you might lose the match and what have you
7754008 you just go out there and fight for every single point because thats a complete waste of time putting the work in if youre not going to use it out on the court
7754009 im going to go home and spends some time with my family ill sit down with them and talk about it
7754010 ill also sit down with terry edwards and see what he has to say and what offer there is on the table
7754011 to win another gold medal in my home city in 2012 would be fantastic thats what i want to do
7754012 it will be hard to say no to 1million but im going to see what terry says
7754013 there are a lot of rewards out there for professionals i could become middleweight champion of the world
7754014 its going to be a difficult decision but its not just about money its a feeling too
7754015 representing your country and standing on a podium with a medal is an unbelievable feeling
7754016 i say get in the gym get in the gym because it gives you lots of discipline boxing has made me a better person
7754017 get in the gym all those little kids all the little teenagers that want to be naughty get in the gym
7754018 rubbish also patched up manchester united got their season up and running with a hard fought win at portsmouth last night
7754019 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7754020 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7754021 it just came with his nature he was always for helping people do better
7754022 so many of the times i called him to seek his advice had to do with personnel issues he was so good with that his counsel was always to be kind to people and treat them the way you wanted to be treated
7754023 its too early to say when in any election the important thing is to win but here because the election is critical i have to face the entire government machinery
7754024 so it is just not anwar versus the candidates but anwar versus the malaysian government the ruling parties and all the excesses you can think of
7754025 if you liked the last one youll like this one
7754026 you got the job because they needed a black guy
7754027 well for 200 years my people didnt get the job because they needed a white guy
7754028 if i did get in because i am black i stayed in because i am me
7754029 you got the job because they needed a black guy
7754030 well for 200 years my people didnt get the job because they needed a white guy
7754031 if i did get in because i am black i stayed in because i am me
7754032 i met kara literally on the streets of new york in 1999 in front of the brooklyn diner
7754033 i moved her out to l a to live with me i introduced her to music publishers kara and i wrote spinning around for kylie minogue when we were living together
7754034 you got the job because they needed a black guy
7754035 well for 200 years my people didnt get the job because they needed a white guy
7754036 if i did get in because i am black i stayed in because i am me
7754037 and just seeing how much from when i was a kid and they just werent very good and now this year theyre the team to beat really
7754038 having shirley be manager of the year beau be player of the year and just us winning 60 games is just something thats awesome compared to if you looked at us two years ago its a total turn around
7754039 theyve got hitting pitching fielding theyre an all around good team
7754040 ive been here through thick and thin yes i have
7754041 weve developed some relationships with the players kind of know them by name big kris regas fan as you can tell by the mutton chops
7754042 go cans sioux falls has got to get behind them theyre in the playoffs sioux city big rivalry lets get behind the canaries and be canaries fans all the way
7754043 floppy was an unusual cat he could always be seen swaying this way and that
7754044 his sisters and brothers would all run jump and play while floppy would flip and flop and flop in the hay
7754045 hes helped me to think bigger thats really what hes done
7754046 every step that he took was a challenge for him he had to focus and he had to walk very differently his tail stood up in the air to keep him balanced and he had to spread his legs goofy to be able to move
7754047 as i saw him live his life there wasnt anything to feel sorry for because he was one of the happiest cats of all of them he came out he would purr hed be the first one to get the food he was always just enjoying his farm life
7754048 i just thought it would be a great way to be able to inspire kids to move through challenges like floppy because he didnt let his challenges hold him back
7754049 i was working with camps of kids with physical challenges and some of those teenage kids really related to floppy because they liked the idea that floppy was real and he really did have to deal with those same things
7754050 and how about videos how about a cartoon how about floppy cat family resorts theres all sorts of different ideas that i have just lists of them where floppy can go
7754051 i think floppys going to meet ben the burmese mountain dog and so it will be a fun thing
7754052 even though he had trouble keeping pace he could always be seen with a smile on his face
7754053 it starts out friday night and it ends up saturday night and were going to try to keep them busy through the whole thing hunting or eating or having little banquets for them
7754054 im excited about it and im very thankful that these people are coming together and hopefully provide an opportunity for these kids
7754055 i mean i would like to see this thing in five years to have 20 or 25 kids we could take out and show them a good time
7754056 we need to do everything we can to keep our kids safe
7754057 i see that crime as among the most serious because youre going to potentially damage a child for the rest of their lives
7754058 if they make contact and they think its with a real kid and they say were going to meet at this site and youre going to be wearing a red sweatshirt and then all show up and meet that kid instead the police are there
7754059 the laws that are on the books right now probably havent taken into consideration the kind of operations that police are doing right now on the internet

7754062 the modern conservative is engaged in one of mans oldest exercises in moral philosophy that is the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness
7754063 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum
7754064 youre here to learn and focus on education youre going to have to confirm to a standardized code of dress in the real world so we might as well start now they can dress like they want to on the weekend or after school
7754065 i cannot find shirts for girls with three buttons and no logos
7754066 i dont blame the school i blame her mom for letting her walk out like that
7754067 im going to be totally hot if i have to come up to school and get my girls out of school for a button
7754068 it doesnt matter if you come from a million dollar home or a 50 000 home
7754069 caleb sure knows his stuff he can surely tell me what exercises i can do to get ripped
7754070 the demographic divide the inequality in the population and health profiles of rich and poor countries is widening
7754071 we will likely see the 7 billion mark passed within four years
7754072 and by 2050 global population is projected to rise to 9 3 billion between now and mid century these diverging growth patterns will boost the population share living in todays less developed countries from 82 percent to 86 percent

7754078 its healthy its important that people who have worked really hard during a campaign are able to express themselves at the convention on behalf of the candidate they worked for they have to respect the results if they dont want to participate they dont but we hope they will because we need to make the change we need to make for our country and i think they know what is at stake losing is hard and people need to recognize the outcome and decide what the choices are
7754079 we are going into the future what did i walk into a time capsule
7754080 i think those polls also show among women sen obama is 20 points ahead thats a big gender gap
7754081 some of the people on the fence on this issue are catholics and i think joe biden will help take the message to the catholic community i know that he will be able to do that some are older in that undecided group and well have to show that the difference between democrats and republicans on issues that relate to older americans
7754082 democrats are coming together democrats know what is at stake in this election democrats want to take the country in a new direction and we are organized and unified to do just that
7754083 i think that women we have to get away from the politics of victim this is about you go out there and you fight
7754084 i think that what hillary clinton did was tremendous for the country she has kicked open many doors which now we have to bring many more women through millions more women through my being speaker of the house was breaking the marble ceiling in congress which is hard sen clinton had a bigger challenge to run for president of the united states what we have to do now is say we have to translate that not just for individuals but for all women
7754085 i most certainly think that calling roll over the states is an important piece of tradition its part of our culture as you say sometimes people say it might not look as clean and neat as some people would like but so what its the democratic way we will come out unified and organized the person that deserves all the credit is sen clinton because her statements have been absolutely great shes a pro she knows whats important for our country her leadership will be something very commendable coming out of this convention
7754086 i think that women we have to get away from the politics of victim
7754087 one of the central moral and legal questions of our time
7754088 as an ardent practicing catholic uh this is an issue that i have studied for a long time
7754089 of course i understand the sanctity of life im pro life and so forth but i cannot impose my political will my religious views on people i cannot impose my religious views on the rest of the country

7754195 the concept of harmony is the core value of the chinese culture from the very beginning and chinas ultimate goal is to help build a world of harmony
7754196 the beijing olympics not only highlighted the traditional value but also added a modern touch to it
7754197 it was a wonderful combination of modernity and tradition it gave the world an impression that china is modern and even futurist and at the same time china deeply respects culture and essence of people and the value of life
7754198 the chinese people are very friendly and they are very good at planning and creating a superb sports environment the chinese people emerged with more self confidence from the games and it also ushered in a new relationship between china and the rest of the world that is china is coming to the world and the world is also coming to china
7754199 it is a vivid example of the chinese traditional concept of all people are my brothers
7754200 it demonstrated the great achievements of china since it adopted the reform and opening up path 30 years ago and fundamentally speaking it is the traditional value of unremitting self improvement that drove the rapid development of china
7754201 china is now actively involved in regional and world affairs and it shows that china is caring for the world and is contributing to the world the olympics was just the finishing touch to the great achievement
7754202 chinas development is centered on its people and will have a better future

7754264 the acccs market inquiries indicated that the proposed acquisition may raise competition concerns in relation to the global seaborne supply of iron ore lump and iron ore finds to the extent the proposed acquisition lessens competition in the global seaborne supply of iron ore it would be likely to have the effect of increasing global iron ore prices which would in turn increase prices paid by steel makers in australia
7754265 likely to face competitive constraints from suppliers located outside their geographic region although the extent of this competitive constraint will vary depending upon fluctuations in sea freight prices
7754266 there would appear to be few alternative suppliers capable of supplying significant quantities of iron ore lump and iron ore funds at a cost that would be likely to impose an effective competitive constraint on the merged firm across the anticipated business cycle
7754267 in particular vale would be the only other supplier involved in annual benchmark price negotiations

7754310 life stories of a celebrated lawyer in new york and lake george
7754311 my experience however has taught me that for those of us with obvious physical limitations compassionate but often incorrect assessments of our condition can squelch our chances to excel and they encourage us unintentionally to be disabled
7754312 traveling with ms can present some uncommon obstacles but it can also offer rare insights into the nature of our fellow travelers
7754313 they had used the wrong name on the document so i insisted that they correct the name before they could take her away i reminded them that they had to bring her home within the stipulated 12 hours
7754314 she told them that it was not illegal to take photographs in a public place and she had not visited any secret areas or military installations they had no legal basis for holding her
7754315 i cant say whether their intention was to intimidate but if they can do this to an influential writer who has done nothing more than take photographs then one can only imagine the kind of threat that ordinary people in tibet must feel every day
7754316 funny enough that story was fake but i just found out i am pregnant
7754317 scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves
7754318 i felt like i was hearing the same rhetoric that id been hearing since the 60s when i started listening to and following political conventions
7754319 i wouldnt take anything away from michelle obamas remarks other than to say that this is an important election this is a big choice for the american people and theyre really going to have to rely on more than a few convention speeches
7754320 she has to answer the question about am i proud to be an american i think she could have done more
7754321 i dont get what is so impressive about her lots and lots of people are mothers lots and lots of people have sick fathers lots and lots of people have children

7754330 vim me unir a voc s para mudar os estados unidos recuperar seu futuro nos elevar rumo a nossos melhores ideais e escolher barack obama como presidente
7754331 estou fazendo tudo o que posso fazer e acho que o demonstrei

7754334 its a huge day for us as a club in so many ways
7754335 this is a match we have to win to remain in contention for the play offs were all disappointed with the performance against the dragons but all we can worry about now is preparing properly to take on penrith
7754336 at the same time its important for the club as a whole and for the fans to honour ruben logan and wairangi who have all made such a big contribution to the warriors
7754337 it would be brilliant to see a massive crowd turn out to farewell the boys and also to help us along on what will be a critical day
7754338 at the same time its important for the club as a whole and for the fans to honour ruben logan and wairangi who have all made such a big contribution to the warriors
7754339 it would be brilliant to see a massive crowd turn out to farewell the boys and also to help us along on what will be a critical day
7754340 what you mean i actually have to have merit to get ahead thats not fair what hope do i have
7754341 you dont stop playing football because you get old you get old because you stop playing football
7754342 i think we are going to hear that theme again loudly clearly and in a heartfelt way
7754343 the promise of america is that all of us will have access to opportunity and i want to run a 2008 campaign that renews that promise a campaign built on a lifetime record of results
7754344 on this january night at this defining moment in history you have done what the cynics said we couldnt do
7754345 i understand that a lot of people are asking what does hillary want what does she want well i want what i have always fought for in this whole campaign
7754346 i want to end the war in iraq i want to turn this economy around i want health care for every american i want every child to live up to his or her god given potential and i want the nearly 18 million americans who voted for me to be respected to be heard and no longer to be invisible
7754347 while i traveled our country talking about how i wanted to help you time and again you reached out to help me to grab my hand or grip my arm to look into my eyes and tell me dont quit keep fighting stay in this race for us
7754348 as a show of unity and in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7754349 dont be fooled into thinking this means its one big happy family working together in concert theres still to my mind a surprisingly large amount of negative feelings on both sides with these two camps
7754350 when it comes to finishing the fight rocky and i have a lot in common i never quit

7754352 natos mission is based on a un mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7754353 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7754354 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7754355 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids

7754379 ive known hemaji as a wonderful person and if she says sherlyn is promoting nudity on her name i dare not contest her opinion after all the video did receive 19 cuts from the censor board if sherlyn has a diva like image she cant help it you cant ask a madonna to be like an alka yagnik can you
7754380 see sherlyn made this video as a tribute to hemajis
7754381 i had to change my body language from a woman to a man in a split second so the mind had to be alert and sharp

7754385 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7754386 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7754387 were monitoring the track of gustav and reviewing our destructive weather plans and procedures
7754388 going to shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7754389 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7754390 clearly we found there are federal implications otherwise we would not have notified them
7754391 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7754392 the view that society can and should be organized without a coercive state
7754393 there is no single defining position that all anarchists hold beyond their rejection of compulsory government and those considered anarchists at best share a certain family resemblance
7754394 we are coming out of here dealing with voter protection and voter registration
7754395 were going to send people into key states in mid september to go into churches and community centers and have people give us their names to check their registration so that we dont wait until election day and find out theyre not registered
7754396 we feel they robbed the election in 2000 in florida but not this time

7754400 i just dont know what happened i feel as if im trying to scrounge around and pick up the pieces in the midst of this media circus
7754401 at a difference of 4 6 dbm one might start to wonder if there is anything wrong
7754402 one factor rarely mentioned in describing afghan logistical problems or considered in relation to barack obamas assertion that afghanistan should have absorbed troops bound for iraq is that the theater is landlocked and accessible to the sea only through pakistan and iran there are in fact should a hostile regime emerge in pakistan
7754403 a range of psychiatric illnesses including dementia major depressive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder stephen reich a psychiatrist from new york state said mr zardari was unable to recall the birthdays of his wife and children and had thought about suicide
7754404 the mentality is we are going to go in and run the football from the get go
7754405 we might get one or two yards the whole first quarter and then the second quarter four and five yards then we start wearing on guys and then we are getting five 10 or 15 yards a run so it might not be exciting or the greatest show on turf but it is going to be efficient football and it is going to be fun and it will be team football its the way we can keep possession of the ball and keep our defense off the field and try to be the aggressor
7754406 if the run is popping it usually means we are not doing a good enough job with pad level and hand placement and footwork
7754407 its a subtle thing its details and fundamentals its not a lack of talent its fundamentals
7754408 when it works our pads are down and when it doesnt we get high and we get jolted its that simple when i block that number i got a chance if you stuff me we dont have a chance we have to win the battles up front
7754409 i am really enjoying what i am doing now because i really feel a part of it and i have a lot of input
7754410 but eventually when you get into this profession and i did it for one reason you want to be a head coach i have that one year of experience but that is the ultimate to be a head coach
7754411 most of them were trying to make nfl teams or guys had been in the nfl and were trying to make it back so they wanted no problems you could say or do anything to them because they had no place to go they busted their butts in practice and we had no off field problems they were fun to coach
7754412 they got enough defensive linemen over there and they are doing a good job but if they asked me you know i am a team player and i would not turn it down
7754413 its really nice to have a guy like dantonio call to tell me how theyre doing they all seem really happy at msu
7754414 he looks very powerful and mature like hes about 24 years old
7754415 he gives us the flexibility to do a lot of different things
7754416 we have a lot of backs so were not going to have one guy take 500 reps in a game were going to spread the wealth but well definitely find ways to get him the ball
7754417 he has a gift god blesses everybody with some kind of ability but everything he does is effortless
7754418 i pushed hard with the arizona people because thats what we wanted to do
7754419 one thing about him is that when he did play some third base at toledo he didnt screw up
7754420 he was an average third baseman when he played but the good thing is that he didnt put himself in bad position we just need to give him a chance to play there for several days at a time
7754421 anytime you got a team like minnesota thats right there and were getting close to september that kind of enhances it
7754422 weve talked about it anytime you can tie or move ahead of the greats that played the game its very humbling its something you look back and feel very honored you cherish that for sure
7754423 its a tough situation since hes come up recalled aug 13 hes done ok but we needed a starter tomorrow and have to make a move
7754424 ive got to sit down with my wife and family
7754425 my whole thing is that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so expletive smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what expletive dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
7754426 see that bird is red and gold its definitely a symbol for communism
7754427 hey this miniscule detail among about two dozen other miniscule details is foreshadowing
7754428 you do not understand fine distinctions it is one of the shortcomings that makes you such a lamentable potion maker
7754429 weve split the two indirect and direct sales weve got a number of named accounts that we manage directly and everything else is an opportunity for our partner channel
7754430 we see opportunities in the sme space and have ambitions to grow market opportunities for partners were looking to develop deeper relationships with existing partners
7754431 we have good coverage in nsw and victoria but there are opportunities to build out our coverage in wa and queensland where we cant bring existing partners to those opportunities well look for new partners as well
7754432 we just havent been able to muster much of an offense
7754433 we havent been able to get big hits or to add runs on
7754434 he gave up the solo homers but it wasnt the end of the world we just havent been mustering much offense
7754435 now hopefully by the end of the week were going to have somebody on all these ors go out with the first group but its still a wide open competition it will remain so at a lot of positions
7754436 right now nick and steve are still battling and i dont want to say hopefully someone separates himself but i just hope that both of them are ready to play and win with by the weekend
7754437 i would think both have gotten to the point where we feel comfortable we could win with both of them
7754438 ill talk with both of them and have my little conversations with them as far as both of them getting ready
7754439 but theyre great young men theyll understand the situation and go out there and compete
7754440 yeah i might maybe not ive got a gut feeling
7754441 they are all right there competing we may start two at one time in our offense we can play two tailbacks at the same time again i know its important maybe who takes the first snap to a lot of people to me its more important to us to play the guys we feel were ready to win with
7754442 martavious odoms has had a terrific camp and we thought he had an opportunity but you didnt know how quickly
7754443 hes going to make mistakes all of them are but he has shown enough play making ability that we have to get him in the game
7754444 so we have eight nine maybe 10 true freshmen that will play for the first time this weekend
7754445 thats why were a little nervous but im excited for them
7754446 and what hes been able to do during these first couple weeks of camp is separate himself and manage and handle the game we want him to make good decisions we dont need him to be an all star we just want him to make the plays that are there
7754447 his development as a thrower has been tenfold from where he was coming in as a freshman
7754448 last year i saw a huge leap forward and i expect another big leap this year
7754449 its unbelievable to have the chance to represent the type of players and people we have on this team as their captain for another year
7754450 i will work to lead everyone in every way i can on and off the field
7754451 oh man i did it again i just cant remember that its not lamingtons

7754454 i wont play for any coach other than phil jackson pat riley
7754455 i do not feel my knee right now because i feel my bronze medal right here
7754456 i only have if god say the same six or seven years left that dont add up to 65 from a business standpoint i would be stupid not to take the 65 but at the same time i love the game of basketball even when i retire im gonna play but thats a no brainer

7754466 its going to be new and hopefully it will grow and the word will get out so when we drop off the team there will be a bunch of our fans lined up on either side getting the guys fired up not that they need any more but it will be still kind of fun
7754467 you work like crazy for seven eight months of the year to prepare to play 12 games those 12 games ought to be very exciting for them all the time
7754468 i think it brings a lot of motivation a lot of interaction with the fans

7754470 oh christ wow that really is thats extremely generous lord i dont deserve that much christ thank you
7754471 if we try to just throw the ball around you are going to get penalties you are going to get your quarterback hit he is going to start running around a lot and he will be in trouble
7754472 we would rather run the ball thats the type of team we are that doesnt mean were never going to pass but thats whats going to make us good
7754473 russell is going to keep growing i know i can make plays so if i get the opportunity im going to be right out there and making the plays that i know i can make
7754474 thats something that the coaches obviously are going to have to have trust in and have faith this is a league where you cant rely on one thing or the other
7754475 its not the type of running game where you can just run a couple times and things are going to break
7754476 last year we continued to improve as the games went along our average yards per carry we werent very good in the first quarter thats the system you have to wear down defenders get them on the ground and get them tired
7754477 kindergarten was really useful too bad it wasnt more fun
7754478 the guys are practicing hard every day and things are becoming contagious and everyone is believing in it it shows in the way we are practicing
7754479 we have to find our motivation in every game thats the key

7754491 the motorway is not expected to be reopened until noon due to damage caused to the central reservation and the need to remove heavy vehicles from the carriageways

7754495 we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with
7754496 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7754497 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7754498 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times
7754499 in fact i dont think we ever go into space
7754500 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7754501 its about a vibrant society its really at the height of its power and the height of its decadence at the same time
7754502 so its really a thriving vibrant culture thats going to come apart as we watch but its sort of the roller coaster its thrilling at the top when you see how far down youve got to go
7754503 prime minister kevin rudd and consumer affairs minister chris bowen must acknowledge the absurdity of grocerychoice and shut the site down immediately
7754504 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7754505 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7754506 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7754507 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores
7754508 what that tells us is that consumers believe it is of no use at all
7754509 it appears that the parents of a newborn at risk of contracting hepatitis b have not presented their baby for medical treatment
7754510 according to medical advice there is no longer sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of any vaccination
7754511 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7754512 we shall do all that is possible to save them
7754513 they are besides themselves and feeling helpless but they are trying to stay positive
7754514 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
7754515 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
7754516 girls and young women need to be protected from their own immaturity and sexual curiousity at that vulnerable age
7754517 your treatment of the deceased was brutal in the extreme
7754518 you stomped on her you hit her with a hose and you took a stick or some other object and impaled her

7754545 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7754546 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7754547 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7754548 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table
7754549 im maybe not a household name but people know of me in the industry
7754550 we are turning the heat up on idol this year and are thrilled to welcome kara to the judges table
7754551 she is a smart sassy lady and one of americas most successful songwriters we know she will bring a new level of energy and excitement to the show
7754552 we had originally intended for american idol to have four judges
7754553 weve seen from our international series that having a fourth judge creates a dynamic that benefits both the contestants and the viewers
7754554 id say i believe in what i believe in and im willing to fight for it and im pretty feisty
7754555 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is its not about vocal acrobatics
7754556 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7754557 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7754558 you can play through the entire game without killing anything
7754559 its very challenging but its also very beneficial when the game initializes the relationships of other creatures or tribes or civilizations for the next level many of those relationships have to do with how aggressive those creatures perceive you to be
7754560 we werent thinking of the sims as a brand we were thinking of it as an offbeat computer game with spore we had the confidence that the players would always exceed our expectations if we gave them more creative control from day one weve been thinking about spore as a brand
7754561 you can apply that to almost any format i dont want to limit spore to just games theres a lot of other activities including books movies tv or whatever you can imagine that we could take it in if we think of it as a brand what that could look like is yet to be determined
7754562 spore on almost any platform is going to be different and tied to the unique aspects of that platform
7754563 sitting in front of a console is very different from sitting in front of a pc whether youre using a mouse or a ps3 controller or a wii wand that right off the bat is arguing for a somewhat different design
7754564 i dont think we could design a sequel to spore until the fans showed us what they like
7754565 i think theres going to be a fair amount of learning over the next few months whats important for me is what sort of stories the players are using the game to tell games that have the longest legs are the ones with the most narrative density
7754566 i had a lot of things kind of open up for me and when the role of kenickie was offered its something that ive always wanted to do as a kid
7754567 thats a big side of me that a lot of people dont know
7754568 they didnt get to see that on idol you know i have four older brothers i was never trying to even care about what i was wearing i was just trying to survive at the household
7754569 me and my son were in bed and i woke up i was really worried
7754570 im sort of only a new boy here so have to earn my stripes i was pretty scared especially with the little fella too i didnt know what to do so i just jumped on top of them both
7754571 im just gonna speak to simon the way i speak to everybody
7754572 im just gonna have my opinion be honest and i dont foresee any problems im really excited about this and up for the challenge
7754573 its really flattering too you know to think that idol even thought about me
7754574 i mean when i got the call i thought they were calling the wrong person so im the new kid on the block and im hoping everyones gonna go easy on me and that i bring a lot to the table

7754581 that when their song comes on the radio i know exactly who it is its not about vocal acrobatics
7754582 whilst air new zealand is still operating profitably we see that some of our competitors are really struggling to make money in this market so whether they can sustain that over the long term is yet to be seen
7754583 that could see us move back into losses on that route as would all the other carriers operating on the route as well
7754584 i didnt go out but my mum panicked and she went to the door and saw a man sitting on the footpath by a dark car
7754585 was tall and wearing a dark jacket and when he saw the light he got up and started asking for help
7754586 i didn amp squo t go out but my mum panicked and she went to the door and saw a man sitting on the footpath by a dark car
7754587 seven has kept the accc regularly updated on its purchase of shares in wan and this review was foreshadowed by the accc some time ago
7754588 seven co operating in the review does not indicate any intention to acquire further shares in wan which seven regards as an important investment
7754589 under the corporations act seven is obliged to publicly notify changes in its shareholding which it will continue to notify to the market as required
7754590 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive
7754591 we continue to make good progress with the integration of the alcan assets that we acquired in 2007
7754592 we are on track to deliver annual synergies of us1 1 billion a1 28 billion after tax from the end of 2009 considerably higher than our initial estimate of us600 million a695 73 million
7754593 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger
7754594 we came here to gather up her kids so they could all be together we were set to move back next month now i have to get her funeral together
7754595 but i dont know if that was it we had a pipe bomb blow up right there three weeks ago
7754596 david s extensive experience in it and business management puts him in a strong position to lead vmware s business and support customer requirements across greater china said carl eschenbach executive vice president of worldwide field operations vmware
7754597 vmware offers the industry s broadest portfolio of virtualization solutions vmware is in a unique position to help organizations in greater china fast track their adoption of virtualization to support their growth
7754598 theyre able to make a lifetime decision at 18 when i was recruited everybody made a four or five year decision on where youre going to play football were able to talk to them about 40 years from now 50 years from now
7754599 and say after five years we expect you to be the boss after 10 years we expect you to pay your scholarship back after 30 years we expect you to have a building named after you its not just a sales pitch
7754600 everybody we coach has a chance to be a future leader of america
7754601 we have to create a culture that you win and you graduate
7754602 its definitely an exciting year for all of us theres definitely more enthusiasm a better attitude than ive ever seen
7754603 thats one of our goals as a team to build family and passion as well as unity the last thing is accountability when we mess up outside in the summer were all doing extra running
7754604 jim wacker had me do that i know the pride i took as a player doing the little things for coach wacker which showed he trusted us and that it was our football team
7754605 we know we have good coaches we know we have a great overall school when we play other teams now its not ok we have rice homecoming we want teams to fear rice
7754606 it may be this year i dont know when its coming but its coming
7754607 when you give players creative control you have to expect theyre going to do the unexpected
7754608 some of its really good for what they were shooting for its amazingly explicit especially when those creations are animated we just have to make sure those people arent messing up the experience for others
7754609 you can play through the entire game without killing anything

7754615 the group continues to perform strongly and the outlook remains positive chairman paul skinner said
7754616 expansion in supply will continue to be limited by access to resources and constraints on the availability of key inputs and skills he said
7754617 so we expect that prices for rio tintos major commodities to remain substantially above the long run trend in 2009
7754618 the headline profit number is certainly well ahead of expectations and the commentary associated with numbers appears very positive at this point in time
7754619 rios exposure to the bulk commodities sector has been extremely beneficial for the company and i think that the results will be very positively received by the market
7754620 we continue to make good progress with the integration of the alcan assets that we acquired in 2007 chief executive tom albanese said
7754621 we are on track to deliver annual synergies of us1 1 billion after tax from the end of 2009 considerably higher than our initial estimate of us600 million
7754622 rio tinto is in great shape and is getting stronger mr albanese said
7754623 the groups performance in the first half together with our growth potential supports the boards view that rio tinto presents a very strong standalone value proposition for shareholders he said
7754624 although we have seen some moderation in global growth rates from tightened availability of credit the impact on our markets has been modest mr skinner said
7754625 i do not believe that global financials are out of the woods yet stewart paterson managing director of riley paterson investment management in singapore said
7754626 as the global cycle kicks in and one by one economies move into recession in the developed world credit provisioning will rise
7754627 the fallout of the credit crisis will continue to dampen the global economy over the next 24 months with sharply escalated oil and food prices beginning to test inflation expectations dhanabalan said today

7754634 wir lieben amerika und wir lieben barack obama der amerika wieder zu dem land machen kann das wir lieben
7754635 er hat keine kommunion keine abschlussfeier in unserer gro en familie verpasst und jeder neffe jede nichte wusste die leckersten kekse gab es in uncle teddys dose
7754636 nichts wirklich nichts kann mich von dieser wunderbaren veranstaltung zur ckhalten ich stehe mit euch um amerika zu ndern und barack obama zum n chsten pr sidenten zu w hlen
7754637 wir brauchen einen oberkommandierenden der unsere soldaten nicht auf der basis eines fehlers in den krieg schickt
7754638 als mein bruder gesagt hat das er einen amerikaner auf den mond schicken will hat er sich auch nicht von der kritik beirren lassen das sei zu weit wir waren auf dem mond und wir k nnen es wieder schaffen
7754639 jetzt wisst ihr warum ich so lange um sie geworben habe ich liebe dich michelle
7754640 air strikes on civilian targets uncoordinated house searches and illegal detention of afghan civilians
7754641 natos mission is based on a un mandate and carried upon the invitation of the afghan government
7754642 take every precaution to try to avoid innocent civilian casualties
7754643 the government of afghanistan has repeatedly discussed the issue of civilian casualties with the international forces and asked for all air raids on civilian targets especially in afghan villages to be stopped
7754644 the issues of uncoordinated house searches and harassing civilians have also been of concern to the government of afghanistan which has been shared with the commanders of international forces in afghanistan unfortunately to date our demands have not been addressed rather more civilians including women and children are losing their lives as a result of air raids
7754645 like the original this trial is ultimately unsuccessful thus creating an articulated and critical commentary about the current war strategy
7754646 the american response to this work has been frankly immature and lacking the sophistication and consideration that other parts of the world have so far shown the work
7754647 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7754648 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7754649 when the numbers were high i would get stopped in the street maybe once a week
7754650 now that the viewing figures are lower on the tv everywhere i go someone will come up to me and say what a huge fan they are that just tells me that people watch the show in a more modern way and that it has reached its sort of critical mass
7754651 tivo had just sort of taken off this was four or five seasons ago and because we were on friday nights most people most fans dont watch it on first run they tivo it and watch it a zillion times

7754653 its really about big business the machinations and the subterfuge that go on inside of it when you have something that is groundbreaking and could change the nature of life and the future
7754654 we all know we take the members word if theres a matter before the courts we take the members word

7754770 why vote on cha cha when they know so many people are against it why rush cha cha now when they know the senate is against it these maneuvers by arroyos allies in the lower house are suspicious indeed the release of pork barrel funds in time for the cha cha vote also raises more suspicion on the voting
7754771 this government is developing an addiction to arbitrariness and autocracy
7754772 the moa now appears to be a mere entry point for cha cha as far as the regime is concerned
7754773 assurances that the constituent assembly will not be authorized to extend the term of pres arroyo are not only misleading but a barefaced lie

7754793 we have a veteran team and weve been counted out so many times this year

7754796 this an easy call mark green gets our endorsement for mayor
7754797 mr green has not been the most lovable candidate in new york city history but he has demonstrated a deep understanding of the issues a sensible approach to public policy and the soul of a fighter that may be the quality he will find most useful if he becomes the citys next mayor
7754798 nonetheless news that mr bloomberg was appearing to close in on mr green in a city with such an edge in registered democrats and after mr green had been acting as if victory were at hand caught supporters of both candidates by surprise they said mr green ran a safe campaign avoiding attacks on his opponents or offering a compelling case for his own candidacy

7754809 we were wondering if larger animals also have this magnetic sense
7754810 sometimes it took hours and hours to find some pictures with good resolution
7754811 in africa and south america the cattle were shifted slightly to a more north eastern south western direction
7754812 but it is known that the earths magnetic field is much weaker there
7754813 ive never noticed that my cows all face the same way
7754814 they all sit down before it rains and huddle together in a circle formation during blizzards but from a cows point of view thats just sensible

7754831 it was in the teams best interest and most importantly in john maines best interest to put him on the disabled list
7754832 give him some rest and hopefully well be able to get him back after two weeks rest at least and some of the pain hes experiencing will go away we felt this was the best route to go right now especially the way he felt the last couple of starts
7754833 its frustrating because i want to be here and i want to help the team
7754834 its a pain back there thats not going away and i have to take care of hopefully with a couple of weeks rest it will be ok but me not being 100 to go out there thats hurting the team a little bit
7754835 this definitely doesnt make us better weve all seen john maine he won 15 games last year and got 10 wins this year even without his best stuff but the bottom line is we cant risk his long term health in the midst of this pennant race theres just too much of a risk to me for us to risk his career which means guys are going to have to step up
7754836 but i cant say ill sit there and think about it during the game i want to win
7754837 ive played in that stadium for the last 14 years so its a pretty special cathedral in baseball and hopefully im around next year to see the new one

7754840 my first two or three years they were the big brother we were the little brother and they just pounded on us so we grew up a little bit
7754841 obviously we have one memory that stands out it goes beyond that though ive been a part of pitchers duels getting blown out blowing them out and its always been kind of an exciting time i think with baseball in general any time you incite fan involvement that wont go away
7754842 knowing the history of the game and knowing the people that have played this game before me have been on the same field is quite an amazing feeling

7754862 it is important to show that stalin acted in a completely rational way as the protector of the system and as a consistent supporter of the transformation of the country into an industrial society administered from a single center as the leader of a country which was threatened with a big war in the most immediate future
7754863 terror was put to the service of the tasks of industrial development
7754864 needed for the solution of defense and other tasks to the far east and to siberia
7754865 the terror was transformed into a pragmatic instrument for the solution of economic tasks

7754891 chinese refiners are unable to match gains from the high price of crude oil in international markets due to controls on retail prices
7754892 they should take advantage of this opportunity to adjust retail prices
7754893 my dad has been waiting for this moment his whole life
7754894 they came to n c state werent highly recruited and their first year they were on the cover of sports illustrated they were doing something about freshmen who made an impact sports illustrated told me it came down to archie griffin or the buckey twins and they said they went with the buckey twins
7754895 he wasnt highly recruited and came to south carolina and what i learned from him is you can succeed if nobody believes in you you cant succeed if you dont believe in yourself he was absolutely right he wasnt fast he wasnt big he was 5 10 180 pounds but was mvp in the bowl game when we beat ohio state
7754896 the game that turned it around was probably the duke game when we were 1 2 1 we put on a great goal line stand
7754897 we had the second largest turnaround in the history of ncaa football from 0 11 in 1999 to 8 4 in 2000 that was a monumental win
7754898 when i was at n c state we had four little children n c state didnt pay you a whole lot so we didnt eat out a whole lot
7754899 two passes hit our defensive backs hands and bounced over his head and they caught them for touchdowns we just didnt play as well as i thought they could have or should have
7754900 we had a touchdown called back for offensive pass interference and then he clemsons rod gardner pushes off and catches it to set up the winning touchdown
7754901 the rain was unbelievable it was the most miserable ive ever seen i remember we played a very good defensive football game we moved the ball but we turned it over
7754902 the fans at n c state were really tremendous they sold the stadium out sat on that hill back there and were enthusiastic the fans at south carolina even when you lose there were 80 000 there theyre very good schools but theyre city schools also they have a campus but they have a city theres a lot to do its a great place to live there really are a lot more similarities than there are things that are dissimilar
7754903 they have great talent they have potentially four or five first round draft picks on defense

7754910 sometimes when im walking down the street oh oh i hear a song and i just love the beat and i want to tell all my friends
7754911 hey my band would fit in here nicely cause weve got the jangle
7754912 we dont believe that replacing the cpu is a good strategy supplementing the cpu is far better
7754913 the financial service industry is one we believe in its a proxy to the economic growth
7754914 we live at the bottom of the hill and they drive excessively fast
7754915 my cat was hit at the end of my driveway which was really unnecessary if people were following the speed limit
7754916 where are they going to get that money out of your pocket
7754917 i think that flex for rich internet client applications can become a major player
7754918 rich internet applications with adobe flex and java secrets of the masters
7754919 let me tell you why this book is worth the money
7754920 but wait there is more in addition to the book you also get a dvd with all the sample code on it as well as 10 video sessions on real world flex p s i was not compensated in any way to write this article i paid 69 99 all by myself
7754921 yesterday i received my copy of ria with adobe and flex from sys con editorial and i admit that for first sentence the book gave me a good idea on how to work better with fds and java for serialization and ascyncmenssage other topics i took a little while and got extra work and points on how to extend default components the books also send you the sessions at the last flex seminars in ny where people like david mendels jesse warden and the guys at farata system are in
7754922 before i start talking about this book which inspired me to blog about it let me bring up the topic of books for advanced level programmers in general
7754923 whose experience in the civil rights movement was a loss of face and the humiliation of being seen as an immoral people and that doesnt go away
7754924 it has been forgotten that the reason why he king is a hero and a great american is because he weathered the status of being the most hated man in america thats not how we choose to remember it
7754925 if someone had told me 45 years ago that this would be happening i would have said are you crazy are you out of your mind for me this is unreal this is unbelievable
7754926 the u s constitution promises life liberty and the pursuit of happiness for all people we have not always been able to attain that but we are on the way
7754927 thats what my brother was all about that we african americans have something to offer
7754928 if im hearing caroline kennedy right barack obama is the second coming of teddy kennedy
7754929 caroline listed kennedys many achievements with the refrain after each one that for those who received the benefits of his work teddy is your senator too the obvious problem what has barack obama done to remotely compare with any of that kennedys life and accomplishments whatever your political views simply dwarf obamas
7754930 at least i dont pile on my makeup like a trollop you
7754931 employers will stretch the bounds because its a natural thing that they do
7754932 anything like this would have quite an impact on the workforce and on everyone else in the community
7754933 partners that have partners who are working on the mine sites would be thinking about whats happened last night and it does have an impact
7754934 want to walk away and start over again things you done you cant erase droping nuclear bomb on japan by usa was fair or unfair a philosophical question who found this interesting
7754935 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7754936 shoot obama from a high vantage point using a rifle sighted at 750 yards
7754937 it could also turn out that these were nothing but a bunch of knuckleheads
7754938 what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name and even though he had grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7754939 those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and our sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7754940 the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for a world as it should be and that is the thread that connects our hearts
7754941 that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbably journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7754942 and you see that is why i love this country
7754943 perhaps six year old kids can be programmed to break out in this kind of daddy love in the future on mars but for now this is kind of awesome

7754957 era un equipo que ven a trabajando desde hace casi tres a os con los mismos jugadores y de repente de cuatro jugadores de la l nea de atr s le quitas dos estamos hablando que le restas el 50 por ciento
7754958 este equipo no est acostumbrado a recibir tantos goles normalmente somos el menos goleado y ahora siete goles en dos partidos lo que debemos hacer es ocuparnos en corregir los desaciertos
7754959 las conquistas y logros en este tipo de lesiones son d a a d a no se puede hablar a futuro
7754960 originalmente se establecieron tres metas la primera se est alcanzando que es la de conservar la vida la segunda es la evaluaci n de la lesi n para saber qu tipo de secuelas puede dejar y la tercera ser a el tratamiento de las secuelas si las hay
7754961 lo que quiere decir que l va evolucionando bien como para mandarlo a una sala con menores cuidados

7754968 there are some great young players coming through here at the raiders and i think we have a strong future
7754969 what he decides to do at the end of next season is up to him
7754970 at the moment hes not talking about doing anything next year were counting on him playing for us next year
7754971 most players adopt the attitude of the manager tests the water at other clubs in super league in england and rugby seems to be the latest one
7754972 thats the managers role and theyll tell you they just want to do the best by their client
7754973 what benji will be doing in twelve months time is hard to say id like to think hell be with us but im not getting concerned with that
7754974 i dont think its concerning him either thats the most important thing its not interfering with his preparation
7754975 the bill was supposed to be tabled after the national kenaf and tobacco board bill but i was unwell so i asked for it to be moved down the order paper and be tabled later there is no sinister motive dont look as it as though there is one
7754976 a person is not charged because of this act but due to police investigations when they are satisfied there is a prima facie case and then it is up to the courts to decide
7754977 we are not going to use this to make a person chargeable that is not the purpose of the bill
7754978 why are we being asked to debate this bill when we have not had time to read and prepare for the debate the time given is too short
7754979 we the opposition had been preparing for this bill all our preparation was for this bill i think there is an ulterior motive in speeding up the tabling this bill
7754980 we have not been briefed on this bill but the backbenchers have been briefed by the police during a special briefing we were not invited for this
7754981 they do not have to give a reason however you can raise your points while debating the bill
7754982 i have visited some polling stations and the process is going on smoothly
7754983 i am dissappointed that some untoward incidents have been reported but otherwise everything is proceeding smoothly the problem of traffic congestion is caused by the high number of outsiders brought in by the opposition
7754984 its definitely the best move footy wise i could have made
7754985 im loving my time here and looking forward to another two years
7754986 the first year i dealt with a bit of homesickness and missing family and friends as anyone would when you change your job and your state
7754987 but from then on ive really built some momentum in my footy and also the way that ive handled things off the field so im very settled here in melbourne
7754988 if someone said a couple of years ago youre going to win a best and fairest or be in the mix i would have thought id made the transition back to wafl footy pretty well
7754989 the position were in at the moment and with a young side i think momentums really important going into the finals
7754990 to win a fourth game straight possibly is going to be a big spur on to do well in the finals and give us a lot of confidence
7754991 anyone thats up to speed on the dynamics of the trade that went through i didnt really have a whole heap of say in what went on so if people sort of bear that in mind i think theyll go easy on me
7754992 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile this far reaching program will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development

7755001 the matter is subjudice this will go on for a while and we plan to tackle it like any other court case we are very close to the films release
7755002 it is a fun film and a family entertainer the film has nothing in common with the harry potter franchise as the story suggests the hari puttar name has been in the news and has appeared at places since the last 18 months
7755003 it talks about the freedom of a child when he is left alone in the house with his cousin and the funny situations that follow when two burglars try getting into the house to get hold of a chip that his father has been secretly working on
7755004 the show is now joined by shilpa shetty she looked lovely as always and very trim she displayed mock anger at meeting me because i missed wishing her on her birthday horrible me

7755010 i signed because warner brothers who are producing the film had approached me warner brothers is an international giant so i could not refuse them
7755011 they are senior actors with a lot of experience i had a great learning experience while working with them in the movie
7755012 i am playing a character which is more real and underplayed it has been an experimental experience as i have done something which i had never done before
7755013 i wont reveal much about what i do in the movie as that will take away the charm of watching it but one thing i can say for sure is that people will not see me running around trees or performing any dance or item numbers
7755014 it is a character based film which touches on various subjects and relationships the usp of the movie will be its script and the presence of veteran actors

7755035 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7755036 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7755037 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different woolworths stores

7755039 when i turned third i saw everyone was waiting for me and i saw what kind of whipping i was going to get at home plate
7755040 im telling you im not going to play tomorrow my body is all beat up
7755041 we miss a play and it ended up costing us a ball game go to the ninth its normally a done deal for us
7755042 just like we would have celebrated if we were in a pennant race
7755043 its great to come back to my old stomping grounds playing for something
7755044 ninety nine times out of 100 guys dont run there
7755045 the move they made today makes us a lot deeper it gives us confidence
7755046 we feel like we have some arms now that especially for the seventh inning on we can finish out games
7755047 ive got a lot of confidence especially with the guys hitting out there and playing defense behind me the way they are
7755048 ive been able to get down in the zone low and get a lot of ground balls and strikeouts
7755049 he gets more people to chase pitches down in the zone so you just have to be really patient and really selective at what you swing at
7755050 he hung in there pretty well against a guy that looks like he might be on his way to the cy young
7755051 he matched him pretty much for four innings but hes got a fastball that looks like its got a little bit of late life to it and pretty good action on the slider he threw a few good changeups too
7755052 to me jodys been the second half mvp no doubt about it
7755053 hes carried us hitting in the leadoff spot and now hes hitting third coming up with some big hits no different from what weve seen all year
7755054 was it seven i dont know what it was but it was tough
7755055 its a struggle to get through things like that at some point you know things are going to change for you its just good that it was in dramatic fashion and we can go home happy tonight
7755056 hes just another righty reliever to me i dont particularly see him that well but i got a good cut
7755057 i cant imagine anyone saying they walk into the batters box and feel comfortable against a guy like that
7755058 jody was great in spring training didnt really have much of an opportunity early they gave it to other guys
7755059 hes stayed patient and obviously is showing hes a big league player
7755060 hes in a pennant race right now and im sure it hurts a little bit but come tomorrow hell come in with a positive attitude and look to contribute again
7755061 my split got better as the game went on and i was able to strike out people
7755062 i threw a lot of pitches i appreciate the opportunity
7755063 my arm feels good and ill be ready to bounce back whenever my turn comes up
7755064 we were real happy with greg smith because his strike percentage was something that we just recently talked to him about improving being aggressive in the zone early be more efficient in the strike zone and he really did a nice job
7755065 we just did not execute well at home early and we didnt execute well on the road early weve been on a nice little roll now
7755066 renowned south african textile designer ronel jordaan takes her inspiration from nature and uses felt to give free rein to her imagination
7755067 to be able to get the big hit its great
7755068 i was looking for a pitch so i could hit it in the gap so raul could score the pitch came to the middle of the plate and i hit it good enough it went out of the ballpark
7755069 well played game by us but it was just one bad pitch that cost us the game
7755070 usually we get in the ninth with the lead the game is over a bad defensive play and thats where we got in trouble shouldve had the game finished in the ninth

7755077 we havent seen a real change in sales of organic food at the moment we havent noticed a pull away i think people who choose organic food will still buy it regardless
7755078 we havent seen a drop in the sales of organic produce sales of organic fruit and veg have actually increased by 31pc from june to july this year
7755079 we have seen that people are being more discerning about their shopping rather than buy everything in supermarkets people are tending to buy the bulk of shop at the bigger stores but are coming to farm shops for select items like meat and fruit and veg
7755080 behavior like this can be characterized as highly suspicious i mean we considered that the vehicle he was driving was not listed or registered to him it was a rental car it was not rented in his name he has no known address where he can be contacted here the ammunition the weapons clearly that would give one great concern
7755081 let me be clear our government will not reopen the debate on abortion

7755083 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach dr larson said
7755084 once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall and it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7755085 people who are at high risk of degenerative diseases like alzheimers and parkinsons or who have had a stroke and are at risk of another need antioxidants in their tissues to protect them and slow the process dr ng said
7755086 we have probably six guys right now with two on the fringe bouncing back and forth
7755087 the coaches think were going to do real well hey theyre confident and were confident those are the only people who need confidence in us were going to get it done
7755088 we have a lot of young guys guys who dont have a bunch of experience but these guys the receivers are some of the hardest workers out there they come out here before practice and theyre staying out here long after practice is over theyve gotten a lot better and theyre going to continue to do so
7755089 hafner is by far the cornerstone of our receiving corps right now
7755090 he is the guy hes a proven guy so hes a guy we want to rely on heavily hes one of the guys that we have to do some things with
7755091 its just a matter of maturing the guys that we have right now
7755092 i kind of see them in the same mold as the 03 group as far as being young guys

7755096 my director abhishek kapoor was very clear that whoever plays the lead singer of the band in the movie should sing the songs himself if the character is about a singer and the songs are being dubbed then it looks a bit fake
7755097 it is the authenticity factor that comes in between however my singing worked really well in context to the movie
7755098 we have tried to bring a slight respect to the sincerity in our work from the audiences point of view by my singing
7755099 i have been singing and playing the guitar for a while this is for the first time that i have sung professionally and i had a great guide in the form of shankar mahadevan
7755100 still it was not much of hard work because i had a certain amount of ability to sing and play the guitar in comparison to arjun rampal and purab kohli who come from a non music background vis vis luke kenny who still has a little hang of it
7755101 i am still waiting for a compliment from ekta maam
7755102 i went to see her once and i was casually dressed she ekta failed to recognise me then when someone told her that this is heer then she said oh i thought you would be dressed in some salwar kameez i had to tell her that i dont dress up like heer in real life
7755103 mamta taught me the technicality of working left right left brought me initial recognition amber dhara added to it and kis desh has added stars to my career
7755104 i never used to go to college on saturdays but that day i went and heard that auditions were on at the campus i was wearing my night dress and they asked me to audition i had never faced a camera before so i was scared but i was chosen i didnt really have to struggle
7755105 a main lead is not supposed to be seen everywhere
7755106 she has perfect timing and enough attitude to stop an elephant in its tracks

7755145 its nice to win this one it hard after the first game it gets you down

7755150 the springboks will get worse if they continue in this way mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach de villiers is talking about not successfully anyway everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7755151 this is still a very good squad of players most are even at their peak or approaching it so there is plenty of talent but what they need is the organisation and discipline therefore peter will need to modify his approach he has got two good assistants so they should sit down and look at the reasons they are doing so poorly if they do that they will come up with a modified approach
7755152 if de villiers keeps on going down this track he will be unsuccessful he has got to learn if he wants to coach at international level you have to have some sort of discipline involved then get the players to play for that the hard thing for peter is that he has never coached professionally and this is one of the most difficult teams to coach
7755153 what they do demand is that you must be fitter and play better from un structured ball
7755154 but you dont need to go to a harum scarum type of game
7755155 but south africa have gone to the other extreme theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first south africas problem is if you have played one game then try to go to the other extreme thats a danger knowing the south african players i would say they would prefer much more discipline theres no structure in their game at present and they have lost all their discipline
7755156 we are going to try and play more expansive rugby
7755157 im not going to panic because having watched the video again i saw how great we played
7755158 no one in world rugby is playing the way de villiers is talking about not successfully anyway everyone has discipline policies and a procedure in their game the way he is talking is nonsense you cant just play an expansive wide game
7755159 i like to do my business get stuff done and prepare myself to succeed this is major league baseball anything i can do to better myself out there id better take advantage of it
7755160 i appreciate my teammates saying that i think it means they have a respect for how i carry myself
7755161 hes able to mesh the intensity of a football player into a baseball player
7755162 and when you can do that take that aggression and control it it means youre a dangerous player
7755163 they gave me an opportunity to earn a job and that was something i appreciated
7755164 thats the thing it wasnt like they were going to give this to me thats how it should be you should have to earn it i had a tough season before there were a lot of good players competing things just happened to work out
7755165 hes a hell of a baserunner going from first to third he breaks up double plays as well as anyone in the league he runs pop ups out he respects the game plays good defense gets on base there are peripheral things that help the team win that supersede the raw numbers
7755166 hes definitely throwing up those types of numbers worthy of a certain award
7755167 i know he doesnt like to talk about it so thats why i phrased it like that
7755168 i love playing this game and i want to play it at the highest level i can
7755169 the last time he came up thats what he did in kansas city
7755170 he was very aggressive and swung the bat very well i like the aggressiveness and how he attacked the balls that were in the zone
7755171 i think i pitched better tonight than i did any time this year
7755172 it show me the work im doing is paying off
7755173 he played well today but i didnt play with normal intensity
7755174 i play a little bit less intensity than last few months for sure important thing final is win i know i am playing well because i did very well the last few months
7755175 i know how tough it is every round i try to go round to round im not thinking far away than second round right now
7755176 i thought he played pretty well for you know about a set and a half he was hitting his forehand really hard and making me do a bit of running
7755177 it was a decent test and i came through it pretty well
7755178 how do i beat rafa thats a very good question
7755179 the problem is playing toronto cincinnati and beijing then coming back here in two weeks two times 12 hours jet lag
7755180 im a little bit more tired than i usually am but at the same time i must be very happy how i did this year
7755181 i was holding the medal for three days to make sure its not a dream its real
7755182 its really very hard not to think about the olympic games yesterday i was trying to go to sleep but i couldnt because my mind is still there
7755183 i still have my friends and i still hang out i race every weekend im gone every weekend im still the same guy it hasnt gotten to my head
7755184 i think its a good thing to have family and friends to keep you grounded
7755185 you have to have fun you have to be serious but you need to relax you cant be just thinking only about racing or youll get burned out
7755186 i feel like hes got the talent i dont believe hell be anything but pretty good
7755187 it was really neat i knew right there what i wanted to do with my life
7755188 i think its great that hes been given the opportunity to make the move
7755189 from an experience standpoint we really felt we were real careful from day 1 and we didnt want to rush him
7755190 if it took him three more years to get to cup that would be fine
7755191 the biggest adjustment is going to be how competitive it is
7755192 when you run 18th in a cup race youre in the middle of a dogfight when you run 18th in a nationwide race youre running really poorly its a whole other world
7755193 we get such a kick out of seeing the work and effort that locals put in
7755194 the enhanced military action would begin immediately after the olympics end on the 24th when the worlds attention will no longer be focused on chinas human rights record
7755195 ensure that areas under their jurisdiction be free of underground separatist or extremist bases
7755196 that beijing has ruled out any compromise with underground uighur groups many of which are merely seeking autonomous rights guaranteed by the chinese constitution not outright independence instead president hu had in early summer ordered more peoples liberation army and peoples armed police reinforcements into xinjiang and tibet
7755197 i am extremely concerned that the chinese government will launch a life and death struggle on the uyghur people once the international communitys focus has shifted from china such a move will further destabilize the region and is not in the best interest of china i urge restraint on the part of the chinese government to not use the recent incidents in east turkestan to persecute uyghurs i also urge the international community to speak out on behalf of uyghurs and to prevent imminent and systematic human rights abuses against a peaceful people

7755204 mate no one in world rugby is playing the way their coach is talking about not successfully anyway

7755208 theyre attacking off everything and theyre going lateral not through defences you have to go through sides like australia and new zealand first
7755209 but he has to change his philosophy because it doesnt fit these players its not credible
7755210 peters big test now is to learn if he learns he can turn it around but if he continues to be stubborn he wont last long because his tactics wont work

7755223 the national assembly for the sake of certainty and stability must pass an act to define what offences or situations will give rise to impeachment proceedings
7755224 the conduct of elections in the first republic was more civilised and respected
7755225 we are now at a stage when we hardly know which offences give rise to impeachment the assembly state voting by two third majority makes it so simple that any trivial excuse will give rise to impeachment as it is now members who were yesterday dining and drinking with the executive may wake up this morning and start impeachment proceedings because the executive was seen last night wearing a wrong dress
7755226 the fiscal debate in nigeria has been coloured by your exceptional degree of dependency on oil revenue and the concentration of production in one part of the country
7755227 the situation there is further complicated by the criminal gangs and armed movements the problems of the delta may at one point have been associated with a lack of revenues for the states and local governments but that has almost certainly changed with high oil prices while todays oil prices offer a tremendous opportunity to nigeria the risks are almost as great it seems to me that a debate that turns overwhelmingly on who gets what share is still essentially sterile and will not serve your needs
7755228 our history as a nation bears out the fact that given the social cultural religious and ethnic diversities of our people federalism was considered the most effective option it accommodates these differences in a manner that would promote the unity and prosperity of our dear country
7755229 the challenge before the present generation of political leaders and the citizenry is to imbibe the appropriate lessons from our constitutional and political history and use them as instruments to forge a federal structure that is unique to nigeria
7755230 the states and local governments must equally begin to articulate and implement programmes which add value to the economy

7755297 que existe frontera entre chile y el pa s de los mapuches que se han hecho y se seguir n haciendo parlamentos diplom ticos con los mapuches

7755308 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7755309 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7755310 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico
7755311 asombra la facilidad con que se estigmatiza a todo el pueblo mapuche
7755312 exigimos de la autoridad un alto a la represi n

7755315 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7755319 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7755320 cuando las demandas no son satisfechas y se van acumulando se pueden generar condiciones para manifestaciones m s duras que en algunos casos llegan a alterar el orden p blico

7755330 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7755331 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7755332 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7755333 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7755334 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos

7755338 we are not going to get carried away because we knew it would be tough we didnt go to stoke expecting it was going to be easy
7755339 it was their first game at home in the premier league and with the way they play we knew it was going to be difficult it was not that we didnt have respect for stoke
7755340 we knew it was going to be a battle it wasnt a surprise but i thought we could have done better again we conceded goals and that was the most disappointing thing
7755341 we need to face the fact we conceded too many goals last season and have now conceded five goals in two games at the start of this season
7755342 we need to think about that and worry a bit about that because it is not like we didnt concede goals last season we conceded a lot of goals
7755343 its a good start and we are happy with the progress we are making
7755344 the players are plugging into what im telling them and what they have in abundance is desire and determination
7755345 getting a win at spurs is great for us particularly as it is so long since we last got a win there
7755346 well still keep it in perspective we wont be dancing in the streets but its progress because last year away from home we werent particularly streetwise
7755347 im not panicking after two defeats although it would have been lovely to be off the mark by now
7755348 this time last season we had won two out of three and then went on a run of eight defeats thats the reason im here
7755349 i just have to make sure i keep the players confidence high and not get too downbeat about our start if we keep playing like that we will beat someone that is for sure
7755350 i thought we were absolutely magnificent and deserved something against chelsea we went out to go toe to toe with them and that is all i require from the lads
7755351 ogbe ijoh people are not tenants to the aladja people not to talk of being ungrateful tenants
7755352 on the contrary the aladja people are customary tenants to the ogbe ijoh people hence they are called ogbe sobo ogbe biyou a name given to them by the ogbe ijoh people from time immemorial this fact is clearly stated in their own udu aladja intelligence report
7755353 ordinarily the ogbe ijoh people would not have joined issues with the aladja community however because of the misleading nature of the publication and for the public not to take our silence as admission of the assertions of the aladja community we wish to react as follows in order to set the records straight
7755354 to justify the fact that the aladja people are customary tenants to the ogbe ijoh people after they were permitted by ogbe ijoh people to settle at aladja formerly tambiri they bear the name
7755355 also during the colonial administration in 1952 the western region government established the boundary lines between ogbe ijoh and aladja when it created the warri and urhobo divisions
7755356 andrew is an offensive defenseman who will contribute well to this team
7755357 we are happy to have him as a part of the roster this upcoming season

7755360 se tutto il resto perisse e lui rimanesse io continuerei a esistere e se tutto il resto rimanesse e lui fosse annientato luniverso diverrebbe per me unimmensa cosa estranea
7755361 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7755362 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7755363 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7755364 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7755365 esperan que sea recordado por todos dando a conocer a arauco como una empresa que se proyecta hacia el futuro como un referente mundial en el desarrollo sustentable de productos forestales
7755366 the savings they will get doing away with lunch in business class they will lose more than that when corporations yank business the challenging thing about business is that whether things are good or bad you have to invest in your product for the sake of keeping customers and to make it harder for competitors to catch up with you this does nothing to encourage people to pay more because you give more they really make me question whether the inmates have taken control of the asylum
7755367 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7755368 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out
7755369 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7755370 we take pride that the democrats are strong on crime
7755371 was directly asked if they had come to denver to kill obama he responded in the affirmative
7755372 believe it or not i still play basketball i was never good at it but i can still carry the ball down the court and put it in the bucket that has helped me a lot
7755373 it has been a real challenge but i still attempt to live each day to the fullest and with the help and support of my family i have been able to do that
7755374 you normally have some weeks off to prepare for the last part of the season
7755375 this year i didnt have a lot of time to prepare after wimbledon for the hardcourt season
7755376 in two weeks two times 12 hours of jet lag after wimbledon i only had six or seven days to recover and before that i played queens monte carlo barcelona hamburg roland garros plus wimbledon also
7755377 i have to be very happy i must be very happy for how i did this year
7755378 if i lose in the next round hopefully not im happy about how i played this year
7755379 i just want to try to continue playing like this in this tournament
7755380 it was very exciting one week ago to win the gold medal but at the same time i knew i had to play here in one week
7755381 nobody likes losing i can deal with things on the field the things off the field are very disturbing i cant think of a thing that happened where if the people involved didnt know right from wrong in third grade they sure did by seventh or eighth
7755382 just to have to answer those questions is a sign were not doing things right we know we need to take the steps we have been weve been moving toward having a better track record
7755383 its sad to know just a lot of people in iowa lost lives and homes and family members and loved ones and theyre still going to come out and watch us on saturdays which is amazing because i wouldnt
7755384 were close to an agreement but just because theres a deal doesnt mean its going to be seen in every mediacom household
7755385 the little boy that would stare into your eyes and laugh when you played with him turned into a boy that wouldnt even respond when you called his name
7755386 this new series will be of the same caliber as the other two these writers know what they are doing they can write good television youve been with us this long stay with us for the ninth inning itll be worth it and thank you for the five years youve given us
7755387 people can now come away on holiday without the restraints of a lengthy time in hospital
7755388 its been put on a hard pitch so it can stay as long as were open its mainly aimed at people who are on holiday
7755389 two patients can be treated at the same time and a freeview tv has been set up for them in the unit
7755390 we already have three bookings and we are planning to take groups of patients away there next year for a week at a time
7755391 in knapp zwei wochen erscheint zum ersten mal die zentralschweiz am sonntag allein f r den ausbau der redaktion wenden die lz medien ein gesamtbudget von rund 2 millionen franken auf
7755392 nach zwei wochen ziehen die internationalen journalisten eine zwiesp ltige bilanz der spiele von peking
7755393 wenn spiegel online die s ddeutsche und die faz am gleichen tag ber etwas berichten dann muss das wichtig sein denn so wird uns immer erkl rt blogger labern nur journalisten w hlen aus sortieren ein zeigen was wichtig ist wichtig ist demnach dass heute eine neue vorabendserie bei rtl und eine telenovela bei sat1 starten

7755396 ive seen whats on tv and im not going to comment on it
7755397 i was unable to locate sgt bruss video we have searched everywhere for it we were in the process of changing out old cars for new cars and we couldnt find it
7755398 this makes it impossible for me to listen to how sgt bruss talked to you
7755399 your generation has done more travel and service work than ours did your generation sees yourselves as citizens of the world
7755400 some may be able to offer longer hours on four days of the week and potentially improve the access to patients
7755401 it wont damage the building or contents but it will make it uncomfortable
7755402 we cannot keep these people if we dont pay them
7755403 dass wir entt uschte und frustrierte w hler zur ckgewinnen
7755404 there is no doubt anymore about that foreign partener lufthansa is in pole position to conclude an alliance
7755405 most doctors dont start people on medications because they like to start medicines
7755406 they have specific reasons and goals for the patient usually when you decide on the medicine it is because you think that is the best for them you always want to give the best to every patient whether they are off the street or a millionaire
7755407 therefore the prescription benefit management services we provide do not interfere with the clinical decisions that may be made by physicians and prescribers
7755408 what happens is you order a drug you feel is best for the patients for multiple reasons and then you get a letter back saying not approved
7755409 many times theres very good reasons why you would stay with the more expensive drugs
7755410 its against the public health and it is crippling office care medicine
7755411 however if the doctor does not then the defendant will simply refuse to fill the patients prescription not much choice to a physician sworn to assist his patients
7755412 we were just sitting around shooting the shit at a bar one day
7755413 the joke was theres enough of these guys to fill a deck of cards
7755414 were allowed to be frustrated by the loss of something we enjoy so stop ragging on us

7755417 we can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light
7755418 conquest is not in our principles it is inconsistent with our government
7755419 can i ask what sort of advice and help you are providing
7755420 ambassador khalilzad had planned to meet socially with zardari during his personal vacation
7755421 but because zardari is now a presidential candidate ambassador khalilzad postponed the meeting after consulting with senior state department officials and zardari himself
7755422 why do i have to learn about this from asif after its all set up
7755423 we have maintained a public line that we are not involved in the politics or the details we are merely keeping in touch with the parties can i say that honestly if youre providing advice and help please advise and help me so that i understand whats going on here
7755424 it is not possible to conduct coherent foreign policy if senior officials are freelancing
7755425 i know that zardaris interest in becoming president has been clear for quite some time
7755426 it distresses me that the u s government has not learned yet that having our guy is not a winning strategy in pakistan
7755427 whoever our guy is isnt going to be the only guy in town and if we go into it with that view well bump up against a lot of other guys in pakistan
7755428 mr khalilzad being a political animal understood the value of reaching out to pakistans political leadership long before the bureaucrats at the state department realized this would be useful at a future date
7755429 did not make policy or change policy he just became an alternate channel
7755430 our very clear policy is that the pakistanis have to work out any domestic political questions for themselves
7755431 the pakistani elections are an internal matter for the pakistani people
7755432 no solution to the kashmir issue other than merger with pakistan
7755433 kashmiris chant azadi amp jeevay jeevay pakistan in equal numbers and with equal intensity
7755434 there was a green flag on every lamp post every roof every bus stop and on the top of chinar trees a big one fluttered outside the all india radio building road signs were painted over rawalpindi they said or simply pakistan
7755435 we look at this data and say where do we need to adjust our plans this time so we can improve outcomes the next time
7755436 now we need to look and see where we fell down so we can improve
7755437 it was really nice to see those gains at new leb
7755438 theyve been working hard and it hasnt always showed up in the results this year it showed up in spades
7755439 but i dont believe those kids went from being high achievers to those lower levels for any reason other than because they were
7755440 he wants to be home he supports senator mccain but this is where he wants to be
7755441 the hopefulness of obama the straight talk of mccain its what christopher shays has always stood for
7755442 he goes where the truth takes him never afraid to take a stand or oppose his own party in a sea of partisanship shays is different
7755443 this is just so typical of chris shays trying to grab onto whoever he could to help himself get re elected
7755444 democrats are very resentful of it thinking hes just trying to capitalize and use the excitement of obama for himself
7755445 chris understands the challenges were facing as a country and always has and will continue to work on a bipartisan basis to get things done
7755446 the ad speaks to the facts that chris is a moderate republican
7755447 in this ad chris shays refers to making the right choices for america and we believe that chris shays has made the wrong choices we believe that he has been more wrong on the economy than he has even been on the war
7755448 barack obama has strong positive vision for america and a long record of bipartisan accomplishment and we appreciate that it is respected by his democratic and republican colleagues in the house of representatives but in this race the good people of connecticut should know that barack obama supports jim himes and believes himes is the candidate who will bring the change american families need to washington
7755449 shays thinks that we should completely focus on change and i think thats a winning message
7755450 even chris shays opponents can see that he is an independent thinker ultimately thats what we want
7755451 is multidisciplinary and technologically complex it arises from the intersections of different fields or spheres of activity
7755452 remember that rebalancing does not need to be frequent annually is sufficient however your actual portfolio allocations will be constantly changing due to varying performances and as you withdraw funds
7755453 dont worry about straying from your desired allocation by a few percentage points but straying by 5 per cent should start to become a concern and straying 10 per cent will have a major impact on your portfolios return in between that range its a tough decision and will likely be dictated by your personal tax situation and personal preferences
7755454 at least 10 per cent of a portfolio must be committed to a market segment to have a meaningful impact
7755455 if your desired allocation to a particular asset class is only 10 perc ent you would not want to stray below that amount by very much in contrast falling a few percentage points below a 30 percent desired level would be less of a concern
7755456 rebalancing provides a discipline it forces you to sell high and buy low
7755457 consider selective pruning of individual holdings that have done well
7755458 ich wei was es bedeutet mutter von drei kleinen kindern zu sein
7755459 je viens ici en tant que femme qui aime son mari et qui pense quil fera un pr sident extraordinaire
7755460 barack et moi avons t lev s dans le respect de nombreuses valeurs semblables il faut travailler dur pour obtenir ce que lon veut dans la vie on est li par sa parole et lon se doit de faire ce que lon a dit il faut traiter les gens avec dignit et respect m me si on ne les conna t pas m me si on nest pas daccord avec eux
7755461 pour moi il sagit dune saison desp rance a t il d clar dun nouvel espoir de prosp rit juste et quitable pour tous et non pour quelques uns un espoir nouveau cest bien l la cause de ma vie un nouvel espoir
7755462 les r publicains disent que john mccain a de lexp rience a t elle scand nous disons que john mccain a lexp rience de lerreur
7755463 people just dont know if they are ready for the change candidate
7755464 our goal has been to reach out and tear down the walls of the convention
7755465 as a delegate who initially backed hillary clinton and someone who has known her since law school days i can tell you i am enthusiastic and energetic as possibly could be in my support for barack obama
7755466 im excited about electing obama in this historic watershed election
7755467 this election is so absolutely critical to our future and there are so many profound differences between clinton and obama on the one hand and john mccain on the other when it comes to critical issues like the economy health care education and the future of the u s supreme court that i believe any reservations about barack obama at this point would be very self centered and even selfish on my part
7755468 listen i wasnt backing hillary clinton because i didnt like obama
7755469 im excited about the ticket i think its going to be a great winning ticket
7755470 i think if i was a strong clinton supporter i would be insulted that they thought i could be manipulated so easily
7755471 as soon as you do that you have to assume the worst you have to assume that the mortgage will foreclose at some point
7755472 on its face i would not be receptive to such a clause
7755473 as pledges normally are paid in either over three years or some as much as five years its normal to be able to take those pledges to a bank and borrow against them but they would not constitute in any way a lien upon the building
7755474 i think that the lease if it came in its present form to the rtm would be defeated
7755475 we have commitments subject to the granting of the lease by the end of the year for 15 million of that amount without having done any fundraising and we have indications of the balance being available
7755476 in years four and five the rental income would begin to come in from the schools and other users that would be renting space in the building
7755477 the question is what is that market and is what theyre offering something for which there is a demand
7755478 the draft lease includes a number of affirmative obligations on the town and our failure to perform would permit gca to perform these at the towns expense we find these to be problematic
7755479 here you have a group of people saying that this isnt going to cost you a dime and then when the lease comes out it says its going to cost the town a lot of money up front and thats not a confidence builder
7755480 what the town should want if this is to go forward is for this to be converted to a center for the arts and not a wider set of uses
7755481 the language in the lease will be clarified to make clearer the use restrictions but the restrictions are already in it and hard to misunderstand
7755482 are we going to give up a building in the center of town to some independent private group to do whatever they want with it for 100 years not with my vote
7755483 i think we better serve the town if we delay our deliberations until we have reviewed all of the new information
7755484 if this project is to be approved no road should be allowed to be built from sherwood avenue the impact on the site would be too great and unnecessary
7755485 you need a permit for so many things but you can cut down a 200 year old tree without a moments notice
7755486 on its own mapreduce is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis companies that are integrating mapreduce and sql are increasing its applicability and giving developers and dbas the ability to work together on a common parallel data processing infrastructure
7755487 greenplum has seamlessly integrated mapreduce into its database making it possible for us to access our massive dataset with standard sql queries in combination with mapreduce programs
7755488 we are finding this to be incredibly efficient because complex sql queries can be expressed in a few lines of perl or python code

7755490 we are coming out of here dealing with voter protection and voter registration
7755491 were going to send people into key states in mid september to go into churches and community centers and have people give us their names to check their registration so that we dont wait until election day and find out theyre not registered
7755492 we feel they robbed the election in 2000 in florida but not this time
7755493 we feel they robbed the election in ohio in 2004 not this time
7755494 its a really intense festival atmosphere with a lot of parties
7755495 i wonder how many people who were going to vote for mccain are now going to vote for obama because they know that death cab likes him
7755496 a lot of these bands are preaching to the choir
7755497 it is the first of the many more steps that will ready indian companies for offering transformational services
7755498 we expect such trend to continue and we believe the transaction by infosys would act as a catalyst for similar moves by other indian it companies
7755499 the idea is to avoid concentration of risk there should not be any practical difficulties if lic is facing any implementation difficulties we will take it separately with them there is no urgency for lic to lower their stakes to 10 per cent in the listed companies as they were done in line with the earlier investment norms
7755500 we are examining the new guidelines and discussing them internally no where do the new norms state that lic has to bring down the existing stakes if any clarification is required we may take it up with irda
7755501 we understand that asking people to allow the county to raise taxes is never a popular thing but we think the timing is optimum
7755502 barack obama steht f r den wandel den wir brauchen

7755525 if diesel prices go up we would shift to other fuel options
7755526 but if we shift to other fuels the price of that fuel would go up and ultimately its the consumer who is going to pay higher

7755694 it was a fair cop i was guilty of taking an explanation given early in my life as fact without subsequent reexamination not for the first time
7755695 i told him the president what we are doing here to observe how elections are going on and then informed him that on september 11 well be joined by about 50 other short term observers the president was keen to listen i think he was enthusiastic
7755696 of course the long term observers here conduct themselves absolutely according to the mandate that we have
7755697 and indeed i raised this with the president we all gain by working together but id like to emphasize to you that the team i have here the observers that i have here wherever they operate operate according to the international code of conduct
7755698 on that for me there is absolutely no doubt whatsoever if anyone has any concerns my door is always open
7755699 allowing you to attend political party meetings is not part of the national electoral commission responsibilities if you want to do so you would rather ask permission from that political party leader but not under our accreditation

7755815 both are doing a great job this year they just induced groundballs its pretty simple he made good pitches he executed and got what he was looking for

7755827 watermans weekend is a meaningful and powerful event for the whole surf industry because it is a time when we can support the organizations that are preserving the very resource our industry would not survive without the ocean as well as concentrating on our oceanic environment watermans weekend is a time to recognize our honorees who have made an impact in the sport of surfing and the environment
7755828 the qualifications for sima environmentalist of the year are extremely precise and tailored to environmental efforts as they impact the surf industry
7755829 as a true surfer jackson browne more than fulfills this prestigious role and is passionate about using his music to protect our waves from projects like heal the bay to preventing offshore drilling jackson has made a huge impact on our coastal lines something i know everyone in the surf industry is more than appreciative of we are proud to call jackson browne our sima environmentalist of the year

7755832 ive never used the words breaking the drought weve got be very cautious but fay could play a role in that well now have upper soil moisture especially this late in the summer it could help us down the road
7755833 its unrealistic to expect one storm event to get us out of the drought be real careful not to be fooled there might still be underlying problems
7755834 it doesnt take that much rain to make an improvement if this is a heavy widespread rain as it appears it will be the biggest improvement weve seen in lanier for quite some time i think its going to be really good news
7755835 if its just fay and thats it then in two to three weeks well be back where we were we need several of these
7755836 atlantas all concrete so things are going to run off there assuming we dont get over that widespread 4 inches of rain the flooding should be confined to poorly drained spots there will be some flash flooding due to excessive rain in places but for the most part its going to be urban and small stream flooding

7755858 i feel good about it if it were up to me im in
7755859 i always say 35 years ago when i was a kid thats where i spent all my saturdays playing in the toy department
7755860 it was the heart and soul of summerside right from the beginning really
7755861 the overall focus was that it was probably the greatest asset that we had in the downtown core that could contribute to some revitalization
7755862 there were some people that were of the mind that it should be torn down and build a new building and there were others and i think others were the majority who wanted it retained and it brought back to life
7755863 we looked at the reports and felt that the building didnt have any huge surprises
7755864 in that respect it was almost like working with a new building
7755865 weve just tried to retain as much of the heritage characteristics of this building as we possibly could
7755866 aesthetically its quite appealing for people they like the warehouse environment
7755867 but also helping the city to do what they need to do to grow the downtown

7755874 i think this right here will be contagious and it will rub off on a lot of people
7755875 i think guys will see how much fun we had and be like man i want to be a part of that
7755876 but the good news is this unsolicited five or six of these guys have already said they want to be part of what we do going forward
7755877 i think hes earned the right to go out there in a save situation if indeed he was to lose his job for a period of time
7755878 it would be easy with our depth to say lets back both of these guys off and put tony pe a in the ninth and chad qualls in the eighth
7755879 but if i had done that earlier with those guys too who knows where wed be right now
7755880 thats a big number not many people reach that so itll be the biggest win for personal goals that ive had itll be nice to be always considered a 20 game winner
7755881 its no more important than the four games we have in chicago after that every game is the playoffs right now
7755882 its been really really tough not being out there but it felt good

7755888 hes on target all the time how can you punish a kid for being too good
7755889 they want to see if there is any interest there
7755890 i was told all along that if something were to happen that this is a position i could find myself in
7755891 i am ready to step in there and hopefully there wont be a letdown at all
7755892 we are going to go forward with the players that we have

7755901 ok guys gather around were on our way to washington those clowns have lost 14 of their last 16 an automatic sweep no reason to even use
7755902 we dont play anyone with a winning record the rest of the season other than the diamondbacks and theyre not much weve got a good chance here to really give
7755903 weve got 19 games on the road against teams with a combined record of 108 games below 500 keep in mind were only one game below 500 so when it comes to losing were nowhere near as big losers as these other losers
7755904 we just have to show up to make the playoffs so
7755905 listen we go home for 12 more games and play teams with a combined record of 42 games below 500 we could play
7755906 arizona has to play eight more games against the playoff hungry cardinals and those guys kicked our butt four out of six we get four against the pirates three against the nationals and will probably never have to use
7755907 things are really looking up wed really have to gag now not to make the playoffs
7755908 you sacrifice wins the season and everything else to have it

7755915 we dont think gronkowski will be part of our game plan
7755916 its going to be a week to week deal we are pretty confident its not going to be a significant amount of time three or four weeks we are optimistic it will be sooner than that
7755917 i have to make the most of the opportunity go out there and play hard and do exactly what i have been coached to do
7755918 i think its time for someone else to have an opportunity
7755919 its time to settle down a little bit and have a life but its been great its been a true honor and a blessing and i enjoyed every moment of it i dont regret any of it
7755920 obviously im disappointed but not disappointed in the preparation or the approach that we took
7755921 if you sit around wondering what if what if what if then it kind of hurts you but i havent really got to that point i felt we did everything we could we just got beat on the wrong day
7755922 you miss being in one place for an extended time being home just three days a month thats a tough life

7755928 i think some new opportunities will arrive and i will take them as they come
7755929 right now im just happy to be in the united states
7755930 if youre playing scared you know you have to do things right all the time
7755931 sometimes thats a lot better way to play because your adrenaline rush is 24 7 you have the mental focus to get the job done
7755932 they know they have to be 100 percent sharp or you can get embarrassed and thats a good lesson
7755933 our best defenses are always against the best teams we play perfect because we know we have to play perfect
7755934 it is like oh no we have to be good our whole defense is young we are playing as if you mess up once youre not going to be out there were playing not to mess up
7755935 a better way to describe it than being scared is you dont want a bunch of good athletes to play robotic
7755936 we want to be able to use our athleticism and to be flying around with reckless abandon you still have to understand and fit in the scheme
7755937 it is possible we may have relied too much on those guys we have to be a defense that plays a team game defensively do things right do the little things i think we have better players than people
7755938 they just need an opportunity to go out and have a chance to establish themselves
7755939 its very hard not to think about the olympic games

7756006 i still hear from many of them they usually call me on my birthday
7756007 i have many fond memories of the boys that played for me
7756008 i think one of the reasons is i was a good recruiter when id check on a player and go to his teacher or coach and theyd say hes a good student and a good player but the minute theyd say but i lost interest in the 21 years that i was at the university of denver i never once had to go to the police for anything that my players had done that has pleased the daylights out of me
7756009 i dont sit around thinking about the past or looking at scrapbooks all day
7756010 i think it might be your junior year before you can do that on your own
7756011 all the freshman running backs go in and watch film together
7756012 this is for bragging rights for the whole year everybody on the team talks about how hard they play
7756013 were going to be able to give the defenses a lot of different looks a change of pace
7756014 its definitely going to be an eye opener for csu when they see the speed of these young guys
7756015 i think there is going to be a lot of discovery on both sides on game watch video of csu tight end kory sperry watch video of csu football scrimmage and interview with coach steve fairchild visit natalie meislers all things rams blog for a behind the scenes look at csu sports play pickem for the upcoming csu football game day

7756041 in the last economic downturn at the beginning of the 90s there was still a large proportion of blue collar workers in the country who retreated to their local pub or working mans club to chew over hard times with their peers

7756123 the refuges are at bursting point the one at gouter you literally cant get into
7756124 before taking their clients up mont blanc guides should find out whether there is room in the refuges
7756125 instead of making their clients sleep on the ice and under canvas at 4 000m they should postpone the expedition
7756126 icefall avalanches can happen any day in the summer and summer climbers need to be more tuned in to them they tend to be on the look out for other hazards like rock falls
7756127 which is not much different to being hit by a rock
7756128 the best way to avoid them is to choose a route that is not exposed to too many seracs in fact the traditional route up mont blanc du tacul was abandoned one reason being that it was far more exposed to icefalls than the one the climbers used on sunday
7756129 rounding a bend i was greeted by a scene of utter devastation forest buildings pylons all smashed and broken almost beyond recognition
7756130 this is yet another example of a seemingly trusted organisation appearing to be sloppy with peoples personal information people are entitled to wonder why they are constantly being told about the importance of protecting personal information when large organisations dont seem to follow the same rules themselves
7756131 in an article from national center for policy analysis one of the key arguments is the shortage of primary care physicians and how telemedicine can extend their reach could it also reduce emergency room use perhaps for the chronically ill especially with remote monitoring over the internet for blood pressure glucose readings etc telemedicine if done right can improve adherence to protocols and improve care two barriers noted is the reluctance of payers to approve this care and not allowing foreign doctors to provide care remotely although i am not sure that i would agree with the latter
7756132 it means robert mugabe has lost effective control over parliament and cannot dictate his legislative agenda as he has in the past
7756133 mugabe has forged ahead with convening parliament and this is very unfortunate because as a party we had hoped something might come out of the interparty talks
7756134 selfish and external interests must not be allowed to frustrate president mugabes meticulous nation building skills as a tried and tested leader
7756135 if you can keep your head when all about you
7756136 weve got our fingers crossed that things will improve but there is the recognition that there is still a long way to go yet
7756137 it looks like it will drag on for some considerable time its fair to say that if you look at the shocks impinging on us this is at least as challenging a time as back in the 1970s
7756138 i hope the bank of england are doing more than cross their collective fingers
7756139 instead of suggesting and hinting that no bank would be allowed to fail they should do what they did in 1974 75 come out categorically and say no bank no creditors of any british bank will lose money full stop
7756140 some vulnerable citizens are going to need help for example when it comes to paying their fuel bills this winter
7756141 the worst way to approach this would be though an arbitrary and unfair tax raid that would jeopardise badly needed investment in our energy infrastructure in the years ahead
7756142 ministers need to focus their efforts on protecting those at greatest risk from the worsening economic situation that means greater support for people living under the threat of having their homes repossessed and helping the large number of vulnerable people who will be hit with huge energy bills this winter
7756143 its absolutely right that the corporations who are benefiting from that original investment and the later privatisation pay their fair share to society
7756144 the majority of my constituents would be very much in favour of this
7756145 crews immediately started treating the child and very quickly took him to birmingham childrens hospital two additional paramedics travelled with the ambulance crew to provide additional assistance
7756146 everybodys in shock there are no words to describe it really the whole road loves them
7756147 the children usually come down here and spend all day with us at 4pm they go home when they went home yesterday they were playing with their dad in the garden
7756148 he was target practising with the gun and then somebody rang his mobile the gun was ready to fire and he answered the phone
7756149 rashids sister is really active and she got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother he was on the high ground and she was on the low ground it hit him right in the middle of the back of his head
7756150 an 18 month old boy is in a critical condition in hospital with a serious head injury after what appears to be a tragic accident the toddler was playing with other young children in the garden of his home in the washwood heath area when he sustained a pellet wound to the back of the head from an air weapon
7756151 as a parent of three youngsters i know that beyond doubt this is every parents worst nightmare everyones prayers and thoughts should be with little rashid and his family they will be going through absolute hell
7756152 thankfully birmingham childrens hospital is among the best of its kind in the world ive had leaders at the very top of the nhs tell me that if their child fell ill there is nowhere they would rather have them looked after than birmingham childrens
7756153 their staff and the care will be of huge comfort to the family at this incredibly anxious time
7756154 right now were seeing a lot of the local people
7756155 i object to all this sex on the television i mean i keep falling off
7756156 she changes everything she touches and everything she touches changes
7756157 iban a matar a obam a desde un punto elevado utilizando un rifle

7756161 robinho me tiene que decir en persona que se va y no lo ha hecho
7756162 estoy aqu como u na esposa que ama a su marido y cree que ser un presidente extraordinario
7756163 barack y yo crecimos con muchos de los mismos valores que uno trabaja duro por lo que quiere en la vida que la palabra de uno es la ley y que uno har lo que ha dicho que har a
7756164 no c mo es sino c mo deber a de ser
7756165 he venido a unirme a ustedes para cambiar estados unidos recuperar su futuro elevarnos hacia nuestros mejores ideales y elegir a barack obama
7756166 hypocrisy desires to seem good rather than to be so honesty desires to be good rather than seem so
7756167 liz when we were young you told us to tell you and keep you from getting with and staying with a man like your step dad and ryan is just like him
7756168 if you break up with me my life will be over and so i am just goin to kill myself
7756169 he had not mastered how to use the internet and relied on his wife and aides like mark salter a senior adviser and brooke buchanan his press secretary to get him online to read newspapers though he prefers reading those the old fashioned way and political web sites and blogs
7756170 i am learning to get online myself and i will have that down fairly soon getting on myself i dont expect to be a great communicator i dont expect to set up my own blog but i am becoming computer literate to the point where i can get the information that i need
7756171 senator when you took your oath of office you placed your hand on the bible and swore to uphold the constitution you did not place your hand on the constitution and swear to uphold the bible
7756172 you mean you can send lectric notes over the internets
7756173 senator when you took your oath of office you placed your hand on the bible and swore to uphold the constitution you did not place your hand on the constitution and swear to uphold the bible
7756174 in the last time there will be scoffers who will live according to their own godless desires

7756176 kami tidak ada motosikal apa yang kami dapat dengan penurunan harga minyak
7756177 apa lagi alasan untuk kerajaan meluluskan kenaikan tambang pengangkutan awam
7756178 kerajaan bn sudah terlalu lama ketua ketua mereka sudah kaya dan gemuk dengan hasil negara rakyat macam kita sudah kurus nampak tulang dia orang makan isi kita makan kuah cukuplah
7756179 esa cifra no alcanza ni siquiera para resolver dos de los puntos reconocidos en el acta el pago de las aetas y la nivelaci n de los jubilados
7756180 nosotros acudiremos a otro nivel con quien sea capaz de decidir pol ticamente la soluci n de ste posible conflicto para as evitar que desarrollemos un solo minuto de huelga en nuestro pa s
7756181 we realize we have people working for us and we are not always perfect but we do want to learn from our mistakes we dont cover anything up it is what it is and well address the problem as it comes to our attention
7756182 every department has a standard operating procedure and if you dont follow that somebody has the right to write you up
7756183 what that is telling me is that my supervisors are recognizing wrong behavior and addressing it through discipline and corrective action
7756184 ray if someone asks you if youre a god you say yes
7756185 he and my mom poured everything they had into me and brother craig it was the greatest gift a child can receive never doubting for a single minute that youre loved and cherished and have a place in this world
7756186 and you know what struck me when i first met barack was that even though he had this funny name even though hed grown up all the way across the continent in hawaii his family was so much like mine
7756187 like my family they scrimped and saved so that he could have opportunities they never had themselves and barack and i were raised with so many of the same values that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7756188 all of us are driven by a simple belief that the world as it is just wont do that we have an obligation to fight for the world as it should be
7756189 that is the thread that connects our hearts that is the thread that runs through my journey and baracks journey and so many other improbable journeys that have brought us here tonight where the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7756190 i was nervous about just chatting with the possible president of the united states
7756191 it was such a privilege to be there with him while he was watching his wife give probably the most important speech of her life you felt like you were witness to some really intimate private moment
7756192 the current of history meets this new tide of hope
7756193 for the first time in my adult lifetime i am really proud of my country
7756194 barack stood up that day and spoke words that have stayed with me ever since
7756195 he talked about the world as it is and the world as it should be and he said that all too often we accept the distance between the two and settle for the world as it is even when it doesnt reflect our values and aspirations
7756196 but he reminded us that we know what our world should look like we know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like and he urged us to believe in ourselves to find the strength within ourselves to strive for the world as it should be and isnt that the great american story
7756197 in honor of my fathers memory and my daughters future
7756198 so what do you think shes pretty good huh shes pretty good
7756199 and its the peas apparently the ones in a pod
7756200 now you know why i asked her out so many times even though she said no you want a persistent president
7756201 im not surprised when she does something she does it well
7756202 she told her story and thats it its a story a lot of families can relate to you know her dad struggled and worked hard
7756203 was more nervous watching her than me delivering a speech
7756204 these vendors will increasingly be considered for strategic service deals and will augment or in some cases replace todays acknowledged megavendors in this space
7756205 such a shift in the it service landscape is a key trend that application development and sourcing managers need to understand and prepare for investment bank ubs has named infosys and smaller firm satyam as its best bets in the sector
7756206 all i know is that it might be a serious blast many of the fire brigades of nearby towns have been mobilized to help
7756207 we are coming out of here dealing with voter protection and voter registration
7756208 were going to send people into key states in mid september to go into churches and community centers and have people give us their names to check their registration so that we dont wait until election day and find out theyre not registered
7756209 we feel they robbed the election in 2000 in florida but not this time
7756210 we feel they robbed the election in ohio in 2004 not this time
7756211 were going to go to sites all around this nation ensuring that our vote is protected that justice is protected because as happy as we are about what is going down this week this week is just a kickoff of justice taking place
7756212 a wide range of initiatives will result in a head count reduction of approximately 550 employees in australia and new zealand or approximately five percent of the companys full time workforce
7756213 media companies fit for the modern media world need to be lean and agile
7756214 this far reaching programme will position us well for the next stage of our growth and development
7756215 its one of the most significant job losses in australia this year
7756216 tempo che il presidente russo mantenga la parola data e ritiri le truppe alla situazione antecedente al 6 continua

7756231 tapi kyai anwar mau salaman sama mama haji kari haji toto ustadz ali
7756232 ke mana ke tempat yang waktu itu lagi ogah gita kayak orang bego di sana
7756233 husy untuk laki laki ikhwan dan untuk perempuan akhwat artinya saudara biasa dipakai untuk menyapa saudara seiman kita
7756234 kamu tahu hendra atau isa kan aktivis rohis kita itu contoh ikhwan paling nyata di sekolah ini
7756235 udah deh git nggak usah bingung banyak baca buku islam ngaji insya allah kamu akan tahu menyeluruh tentang agama kita ini orang orang seperti hendra isa atau mas gagah bukanlah orang orang yang error mereka hanya berusaha mengamalkan islam dengan baik dan benar kitanya aja yang belum ngerti dan sering salah paham
7756236 sepupuku yang kuliah di amerika lucu deh pulang dari amerika malah pakai jilbab ajaib itulah hidayah
7756237 mas sedih karena allah rasul dan islam kini sering dianggap remeh sedih karena umat banyak meninggalkan quran dan sunnah juga berpecah belah sedih karena saat mas bersenang senang dan bisa beribadah dengan tenang saudara saudara seiman di belahan bumi lainnya sedang digorok lehernya mengais ngais makanan di jalan dan tidur beratap langit
7756238 apa nggak bosan pa tiap minggu rutin mengunjungi relasi ini itu kebutuhan rohaninya kapan
7756239 lho rambut gita kan udah nggak trondol lagian belum mau deh jreng
7756240 gita lebih anggun jika pakai jilbab dan lebih dicintai allah kayak mama
7756241 hidayah perasaan gita duluan yang dapat hidayah baru mama gita pakai rok aja udah hidayah
7756242 betapa islam yang jelas jelas mengangkat harkat dan martabat wanita dituduh mengekang wanita hanya karena mensyariatkan jilbab

7756250 laa ilaaha illa llah muham mad ra sul allah suara mas gagah pelan namun tak terlalu pelan untuk bisa kami dengar
7756251 for them i see a totally different school rules dress code a new environment i dont know if its good or bad
7756252 this year its time for us to make that giant leap and become a playoff contender
7756253 we have such good rapport and feel for one another
7756254 we brought the expert in here to make sure were doing it the right way
7756255 hes a player thats getting continuously better every time we go out
7756256 there are still some mistakes that concern you the closer you get to the season but obviously he can be a big help to us offensively
7756257 we are trying to evaluate these guys and see who can get there from a one on one standpoint who can create some pressure
7756258 the key right now is that we keep moving people around because im not sure that we know who is going to be there opening day
7756259 to put a finger on right where were at right now weve had a good camp there have been some good things
7756260 were going to end up with some new faces that are going to make us better weve got a tremendous challenge ahead of us
7756261 the bottom line from my perspective is the surgery went well right now its a rough day for him but everything went well
7756262 he was fixing to be as big part of this team and to go out there on that field and see this kid laying there after what he went through was tough i think its just the reality of how tough this game is and what can happen to you on any given play
7756263 i just thank the good lord the kids going to be fine
7756264 i know its a very very difficult time i talked to his mom shes an amazing mom he has a great support system so harrys going to be ok
7756265 harry had shown up every day and was making plays for us he was really a guy we could have counted on this season
7756266 we were talking about it this morning you can be out there in one play and it can be over for you just like that
7756267 i talked to cedric the other day and he told me how well hes doing
7756268 were rooting for him and i just cant wait to see him walk through those practice gates
7756269 it raises the question of the fact that this may be a racial profiling situation and i say this without knowing the deputys background
7756270 jameel is a young african american driving a very nice mercedes benz around the sugar land area a very nice neighborhood that he lives in the deputy is anglo
7756271 after talking to him thats when i made the suggestion of calling the fort bend county d a s office and i told them test the marijuana the container the baggies anything for jameels fingerprints
7756272 i want to see a shovel going in the dirt asap
7756273 its very hard not to think about the olympic games
7756274 very difficult to refocus i mean all my thinking is there in beijing
7756275 maybe a little experience came through for me at 4 all in the last set
7756276 in russia if you stop anyone in the street and ask what is a grand slam i dont think many people can tell you but everyone knows the olympic games there is nothing bigger
7756277 people just come to me and say oh im happy for you
7756278 i dont know what is best to be a little bit tired but very comfortable and very positive or to be fresh and not play in the olympic games
7756279 olen t n n ollut hautajaisissa muuten en ehk pukeutuisi pelkk n mustaan yrit n pukeutua tyylikk sti ty ni vaatii sen vapaa ajallani viihdyn parhaiten verkkareissa tai bikineiss

7756299 if daw aung san suu kyi continues to refuse food from her comrades her health will be of serious concern
7756300 two people living with daw aung san suu kyi are also refusing food the international communitys immediate action is necessary
7756301 what are you thinking by showing the finger like that
7756302 all mankind is of one author and is one volume when one man dies one chapter is not torn out of the book but translated into a better language and every chapter must be so translated as therefore the bell that rings to a sermon calls not upon the preacher only but upon the congregation to come so this bell calls us all but how much more me who am brought so near the door by this sickness no man is an island entire of itself any mans death diminishes me because i am involved in mankind and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls it tolls for thee
7756303 tempo che il presidente russo mantenga la parola data e ritiri le truppe alla situazione antecedente al 6 continua
7756304 at the same time we cant talk about the problems weve fixed
7756305 we are not convinced that the government needs to take any action over the near term
7756306 i wouldnt use the word shortage but supplies are fairly limited
7756307 i know there have been some retail outages where not all products are available every day
7756308 in a recessionary economy people will stay home a little more
7756309 theres a tendency to just grab a bag of chips and a six pack and stay put
7756310 ive lived here a dozen years and this was the worst hailstorm ive seen
7756311 we share the same concerns with the rest of the nation the same things that are hitting wichita kan are hitting us in los angeles
7756312 real incomes are being pushed down as prices increase especially on food and gas it really affects people theyre squeezed from both directions
7756313 could have done a better job of not letting oil prices go up so much
7756314 my brother in law just lost his job at a car dealership they just arent selling cars
7756315 even if you can get a good price for your crop you still cant make a profit
7756316 a lot of people are leaving the state theyre losing their homes they cant afford the taxes or the insurance and the food and gas prices are going up
7756317 you know this is being overblown yes we have some clinton delegates in our delegation but we think this is going to be all right
7756318 they drive laws that affect whether or not hoas homeowner associations can ban renewable energy systems
7756319 in a new industry like this the only way any company can survive is if everybody bands together
7756320 is there any programming challenge you solved that you are really proud of
7756321 we shouldnt delude ourselves into thinking we are going to build a panic proof system
7756322 but there are choices between less and more panics more virulent ones less virulent ones and that is the way we want to push the system
7756323 its not just about the speaker but mugabe has lost control of parliament which makes it very difficult to govern
7756324 the majority of people in zimbabwe are saying if you are not in control of the security forces dont sign because it means mugabe can unleash violence whenever he likes
7756325 that is one of the drivers in the changes that we made
7756326 but these are jobs available to those in the lower skill set and there are not many jobs for them after this
7756327 whatever game plan mugabe had has been complicated and this greatly diminishes his capacity to form a cabinet and govern
7756328 mugabe is seriously weakened and he and zanu pf will have to take the negotiations more seriously
7756329 this is highly significant because it means zanu pf have lost the legislative control of parliament it shows there is a determination throughout the opposition that there should not be any two party arrangement with zanu pf and it will force president mbeki to take morgan tsvangirais concerns more seriously
7756330 you sit on that side you are now in the opposition
7756331 this is a truly historic event and i would like on behalf of the president our party and this side of this august house to congratulate you
7756332 there is something more than just the reduction in driving that has to be brought in as an explanation for the huge drop in fatalities
7756333 a lot of laptops get damaged going through security so protection is key
7756334 i think were going to see significant growth in this because it really makes consumer travel easier
7756335 would produce a clear and unobstructed image of the laptop
7756336 this is a solid example of government collaborating with the private sector to conceptualize and produce a product that really works to improve and advance the security process
7756337 we put the challenge out there and bag manufacturers overwhelmingly responded with innovative products that provide a win win for travelers and tsa
7756338 we dont know who kidnapped them there is a rebel group which kidnaps for ransom separate from rivals who have political objectives
7756339 we shall do all that is possible to save them
7756340 they are besides themselves and feeling helpless but they are trying to stay positive
7756341 prime minister kevin rudd and consumer affairs minister chris bowen must acknowledge the absurdity of grocerychoice and shut the site down immediately
7756342 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7756343 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7756344 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7756345 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores
7756346 when you learned she was 12 you continued to have a sexual relationship with her
7756347 by that time you say you were in love with her and somehow convinced yourself it was appropriate to continue
7756348 it appears that the parents of a newborn at risk of contracting hepatitis b have not presented their baby for medical treatment
7756349 according to medical advice there is no longer sufficient evidence of the effectiveness of any vaccination

7756471 it is important to show that stalin acted in a completely rational way as the protector of the system and as a consistent supporter of the transformation of the country into an industrial society administered from a single center as the leader of a country which was threatened with a big war in the most immediate future
7756472 terror was put to the service of the tasks of industrial development
7756473 needed for the solution of defense and other tasks to the far east and to siberia

7756589 70million hit in their bid to snatch the premier league title back from manchester united
7756590 spurs moved swiftly yesterday to indicate that they were willing to relegate berbatov to the second string where he would remain even after the closure of the transfer window should united not offer the full 30m the tottenham hierarchy would argue that he was not psychologically ready to represent the first team leaving him in limbo with two years to run on his contract compromise is still likely to be reached before mondays midnight deadline but spurs are dismayed that no real interest has been expressed in the striker by any other club
7756591 united remain hopeful that a deal can be struck even though ferguson expressed concern last night that time was running out with tottenham continuing to play hard ball despite the old trafford club lodging an improved offer of 25 million over the weekend emil dantchev berbatovs agent is in england trying to broker a deal but while tottenham are demanding more than 30 million and are reluctant to release the player until a successor has been lined up a breakthrough is thought to be imminent
7756592 if berbatov does sign for united shortly will tottenham really feel as if the extra few million pounds have vindicated the whole exercise there are no grounds for warming to them as feisty underdogs when occupying a comparatively similar position to that of united they too flex their muscle ask blackburn who lost david bentley to white hart lane how much affinity they have for tottenham as it is tottenham are under stress the only fate worse than losing berbatov now may be retaining this moody virtuoso in a surly frame of mind
7756593 dimitar berbatov is probably about as welcome in the spurs dressing room right now as i would be on the terraces at white hart lane but at least i have respect for tottenham berbatovs attitude stinks he is showing no respect towards the guys who are bothered to turn out on saturday and work hard and he is treating the club with disdain if i were a tottenham player i would not be able to speak to berbatov at the moment being not ready to play against sunderland at the weekend is putting it mildly spurs should have got rid weeks ago
7756594 in each of his first two seasons for tottenham he scored 23 goals but he also provided the sort of physical presence and silky touch to extract the best from his partner up front berbatov also seemed most likely to deliver in the biggest matches ferguson has often talked of a players ability to cope with the old trafford stage however distasteful his recent behaviour also points to a self belief that he belongs at one of europes biggest clubs
7756595 darren bent is the only available option although club representatives again watched the colombian international striker falcao play and score for argentinian club river plate at the weekend the 22 year old is available for 15m 12m and spurs may also consider a move for ajaxs klaas jan huntelaar even though they believe the dutch international is overpriced spurs insist they are no longer interested in signing andrei arshavin but both the players representatives and his club zenit st petersburg still believe that a deal can be struck especially as the asking price for the 27 year old has been dropped to 20m
7756596 comolli has been instructed to find spurs manager juande ramos two top class strikers to replace berbatov and robbie keane and his position will be under threat if he does not deliver comolli was yesterday described as being busy busy busy in his pursuit of strikers with river plates 10m rated radamel falcao and 20m dutchman klaas jan huntelaar believed to be among his targets now with one week left in which to do business it is quite simply time for comolli to deliver the clock is ticking
7756597 was that a mistake too ferguson may never say it was but he appears to regret letting the prolific dutchman go why else would he be pursuing dimitar berbatov with such vigour upon signing him and united are confident they can do so this week for about 25m the bulgarian will be expected to provide everything van nistelrooy once did an outlet for the sides dynamic and willing runners a target for those able to play a raking pass from deep and of course goals despite his current lack of focus a record of 46 goals in two seasons proves the 27 year old bulgarian is more than capable of supplying those
7756598 it seems strange that a manager who has signed 10 new players since taking charge 45 games ago should still be short in so many positions but juande ramos has been improvising cack handedly since the start of the campaign with a slew of new signings spurs can be forgiven for lacking fluidity so far similarly trying two different and equally ineffective formations against middlesbrough and sunderland need not be alarming but several other factors cannot so readily be attributed to teething trouble oddities include omitting tom huddlestone when the midfield is chronically weak sticking didier zokora at full back in place of the injured alan hutton after paying 2m for chris gunter removing david bentley from the wing where he has thrived in recent seasons and of course indulging dimitar berbatovs brooding
7756599 most impressive though was the way that fletcher got forward in support from the right of midfield making nonsense of the claim that the starting position is more important than the finish and showing capello who was in the stand with two assistants what he was missing by picking a player as inert as david beckham on one flank fletcher the scotland player is no cristiano ronaldo but he has scored twice in as many premier league matches crucial interventions considering uniteds underwhelming start to the season
7756600 ferguson is determined to make good on his promise to wayne rooney to play him as one of two strikers in a 4 4 2 formation although it is open to debate how long he will keep that up should berbatov arrive soon there was precious little in what rooney did last night to suggest to ferguson or the watching fabio capello that the england striker is capable of scoring the goals that the injured ronaldo scored for this team last season
7756601 in 128 appearances for united before last night he had scored 53 goals so what is it we want from a player who by common consensus is the most prodigious talent that the nation has produced since paul gascoigne came on as a substitute for newcastle united and curled a right foot effort into the back of oxford uniteds net way back in 1985
7756602 anything less could create the biggest financial crisis in the clubs recent history the american owners are facing huge costs to build a new stadium and also to refinance loans in the near future and they have already transferred some of their debt to the club which means that 30m a year has to be found to meet interest repayments failure to even reach the group stages would cost liverpool an immediate 12m and put in question all benitezs plans
7756603 this arsenal team even so early in the season are looking a pale shadow of their predecessors where are the figures such as tony adams patrick vieira dennis bergkamp thierry henry men of stature men of influence i dont see them as an opponent youd stand next to this present lot in the players tunnel and think theyre just a bunch of kids ill have some of this they dont scare you there is little physical presence on the pitch they dont impose themselves either they play what i call playstation football pretty lots of running with the ball intricate passing but then nothing just powderpuff overindulging and overelaborating no punch no penetration no end product as a team they look extremely vulnerable
7756604 senderos is set to join milan on a season long loan with the italians having the option to make the deal permanent for a fee believed to be between 5 5 million and 6 3 million he made a series of errors in high profile games and was granted a few days leave by arsene wenger after his slack marking contributed to arsenals champions league exit at liverpool last season the surprise signing of mikael silvestre from manchester united last week opened the door for senderos exit and if he settles into a milan defence where alessandro nesta and paolo maldini have struggled with injury it is likely he has played his final game for arsenal
7756605 manchester city have made an official bid in the region of 10m to bring shaun wright phillips back from chelsea
7756606 the 26 year old has misgivings about returning to manchester and will need to be convinced not to remain on the fringes at stamford bridge city hope he can be tempted by a salary that would make him the highest paid player in the clubs history chelsea hope the deal can be concluded as soon as possible so the money can be put towards their proposed 28m signing of robinho from real madrid
7756607 70million hit in their bid to snatch the premier league title back from manchester united
7756608 billionaire owner roman abramovich has given the go ahead to seal the 27m signing of real madrid striker robinho this week and he is writing off 43m just to get rid of andriy shevchenko and shaun wright phillips
7756609 vincent kompany had only met his team mates a couple of days before producing a highly accomplished performance in sundays win over west ham not only that it was the way he dovetailed smoothly with michael johnson in central midfield that must have left hughes feeling very encouraged sometimes a partnership doesnt need much work it just clicks into place and that certainly seemed to be the case here kompanys natural tendency to sit in front of the back four trying to break up attacks before spreading the play with an excellent range of passes short and long suited the athletic johnson just fine
7756610 he knows when to get involved in the build up play and when to concentrate on making sure that when a ball comes into the box he has an opportunity of scoring as well as being dominant in the air he is not a bad finisher for someone so inexperienced proven by the 12 goals he scored in his first season at bournemouth even though the team were relegated from league one
7756611 it seems that nobody had told van basten that there was a transfer window in the winter too leading him to buy just about every player he could get his hands on the prolific argentine striker dar o cvitanich the new most expensive player in dutch football miralem sulejmani the former psv midfielder ismael aissati and the versatile evander sno will all be grazing on the lush amsterdam arena pasture this year but van bastens most curious signing was the barcelona defender oleguer presas whats confusing isnt so much that van basten bought him but that there was a transfer at all oleguer is a staunch socialist who one might presume opposes the capitalist jungle of the modern transfer market yet oleguer had been keen on this move he had meshed well with frank rijkaards laissez faire approach in barcelona but his new manager has a flair for despotism the two should clash nicely
7756612 i like the look of the team they have constructed if they can find a striker worth 15 goals a season or so they could be a real force to be reckoned with sergio volpi guarantees good shape to any team he is part of while gaby mudingayi is the kind of player who provides drive and purpose in midfield if any of their young south americans proves to be any good that would give them an extra dash of quality
7756613 i believe in the guardiola project i have seen the new bar a coach and his side in training and the team seems to be switched on and up for it that is the real difference between them winning or losing la liga they have the most talented squad in spain and their new attitude and confidence will give them the title
7756614 spurs 30m for berbatov or we stick him in the reserves

7756631 currently basic safety training is carried out to different depths of understanding and covers varying safety elements every worker on the ukcs is required to complete basic offshore survival training however this does not include training on risk assessment process safety or platform integrity these elements are normally covered through additional in house training but the core content can vary from company to company
7756632 by undertaking the new additional elements of basic safety training through a registered training centre every employee working on an installation on the ukcs will have the same starting level of safety understanding and awareness the vantage pob system will be updated and there will be no need for individuals to undergo similar or repetitive training every time they visit a different installation subject to any required company or site specific induction
7756633 we didnt reinvent the wheel 90 of the content is not new and people will recognise it but although the basics are essentially the same right now theres a lack of consistency we recognise that adopting common standards and engaging the essential support to apply them uniformly across industry is a challenge but there is a real prize out there now its up to each individual company to implement the standards

7756766 of course the obama campaign has been here before just about a year ago obama was stagnant in the polls his supporters were nervous and full of advice and in the crowning moment of his whole race obama shut them out he turned his back on the universe of geniuses and stayed true to his core identity

7756769 while out of the box sharepoint is pretty good newsgator social sites just makes it awesome were finding that social sites is the critical glue in making it easy for our users to find information share ideas and collaborate with their peers at the end of the day social sites is wildly improving the ways we communicate across all parts of the organization
7756770 we considered a variety of social computing solutions including consumer based social networking products but they fell short on business specific features internal systems integration and security capabilities microsoft and newsgator offered us an enterprise class social computing solution that delivers the social networking features we need today while providing us with a platform that can easily evolve as our needs grow and change in addition their solution integrates seamlessly with our technology infrastructure and security protocols helping to lower our support costs
7756771 social sites was the ideal solution to enhance sharepoints capabilities and to drive sharepoint adoption with the combined social sites and sharepoint solution we have increased intranet usage and helped employees realize an average time savings of 30 minutes per day

7756773 people get so accustomed to rolling through a reminder helps

7756777 if this is what it takes to make you stop even if you are just stopping to look its a good thing
7756778 a huge number of people suffer from allergies and while hay fever for example is generally not life threatening allergy sufferers often also have asthma which can be deadly
7756779 we used a speech stressor test used in a lot of psychology research
7756780 basically the participants each appeared before a panel of several evaluators who supposedly were behavioral experts participants had to give a 10 minute speech which was videotaped and then are asked a series of math questions they had to solve without paper or pen
7756781 the whole exercise is a nice stress experiment in the laboratory
7756782 the wheals on a person who was moderately anxious because of the experiment were 75 percent larger after the experiment compared to that same persons response on the day when they were not stressed
7756783 but people who were highly anxious had wheals that were twice as big after they were stressed compared to their response when they were not stressed moreover these same people were four times more likely to have a stronger reaction to the skin test one day later after the stress
7756784 late phase reactions also occur in allergic asthma and can in the proper settings be potentially life threatening
7756785 the results of this study should alert practitioners and patients alike to the adverse effects of stress on allergic reactions in the nose chest skin and other organs that may seemingly resolve within a few minutes to hours after starting but may reappear the nest day when least expected
7756786 whats interesting about this is that it shows that being stressed can cause a persons allergies to worsen the next day
7756787 this is clinically important for patients since most of what we do to treat allergies is to take antihistimines to control the symptoms runny nose watery itchy eyes and congestion
7756788 antihistimines dont deal with those symptoms on the next day people may be setting themselves up to have more persistent problems by being stressed and anxious when allergy attacks begin

7756806 the best day on which the sun has risen is friday on it adam was created on it he was expelled from paradise on it his repentance was accepted on it he died and on it the last hour will take place on friday every beast is on the lookout from dawn to sunrise in fear of the last hour but not jinn and men and it contains a time at which no muslim prays and asks anything from allah but he will give it to him
7756807 allah created adam from a handful that he gathered from the entire earth so the sons of adam come like the earth some of them are red some are white some are black and some are in between some of them are easy some of them are difficult some are evil and some are good
7756808 and indeed we created man from sounding clay of altered black smooth mud
7756809 he created man adam from sounding clay like the clay of pottery
7756810 allah created adam in his complete shape and form directly sixty cubits about 30 meters in height
7756811 so whoever will enter paradise will be of the shape and form of adam since then the creation of adams offspring i e stature of human beings is being diminished continuously to the present time
7756812 and he allah taught adam the names of all things
7756813 we did indeed offer the trust amanah i e the responsibility or obedience to fulfill obligatory duties to the heavens and the earth and the mountains i e the trust was offered to the rest of creation but they refused to undertake it being afraid thereof but man undertook it he was indeed unjust and ignorant i e he did not fully comprehend the difficulty thereof with the result that allah has to punish the hypocrites men and women and the unbelievers men and women and allah turns in mercy to the believers men and women for allah is oft forgiving most merciful
7756814 allah created adam then passed his right hand over his back and brought forth from it his offspring
7756815 souls are troops collected together and those who got along with each other in the heaven from whence they came would have an affinity with one another in this world and those amongst them who opposed each other in heaven would also be divergent in the world
7756816 he who believes in allah and the hereafter if he witnesses any matter he should talk in good terms about it or keep quiet
7756817 o mankind be dutiful to your lord who created you from a single person adam and from him adam he created his wife hawwa and from them both he created many men and women
7756818 then began iblis to whisper suggestions to them bringing openly before their minds all their shame that was hidden from them before he said your lord only forbade you this tree lest ye should become angels or such beings as live for ever
7756819 so by deceit he iblis brought about their fall when they tasted of the tree their shame became manifest to them and they began to sew together the leaves of the garden over their bodies
7756820 allah created adam tall with thick hair just as a date tree with full branches
7756821 we said get ye down all ye people with enmity between yourselves
7756822 then learnt adam from his lord words of inspiration and his lord turned towards him for he is oft returning most merciful
7756823 o mankind be dutiful to your lord who created you from a single person adam and from him adam he created his wife and from them both he created many men and women
7756824 o mankind we have created you from a male and a female and made you into nations and tribes that you may know one another verily the most honorable of you with allah is that believer who has at taqwa piety consciousness of allah verily allah is all knowing all aware

7756872 i am kind of amazed at some of the things that no one seems to care about when the fdic seized indymac it was a godsend get that crummy lender out of the picture then the fdic announces a radical plan to allow homeowners who borrowed from them to get off the toxic 2 and 28s and teasers and go into fixed rate loans with some forbearance we got that this week no one cared no one
7756873 now right now when we see this we are skeptical when stockpickr decided to give its borrowers more grace the same grace that other banks give we immediately figured it was a canard to mask things but john stumpf the ceo said it seemed like the right thing to do and the bank would do better trying to work things out with lenders than throw them out on their butts instead of course the rate of foreclosures went down and i bet ultimately the number of foreclosures will go lower
7756874 we need time we need time to solve the housing depression the elements of time play out positively because we are a growth nation that cannot have as few built and as few homes bought as in 1991 when we had 248 million people in this country we now have about 310 million people we have more than 60 million more people in this country and we are buying as many homes as we did back then how long can that last
7756875 the answer of course is that given the dramatic overbuilding and the foreclosed homes the oversupply will take months to burn off but not years the trick is to restrict supply which wasnt being done by the homebuilders until
7756876 thats why we need the fdic to own more banks and more banks like wells to work it through and more money from the fha you can see how the system is being overwhelmed by the simple equation of demand vs supply in 2006 for example 7 million homes changed hands slightly more than 2 million were new homes in 2008 we get half the number of new homes being built but we are going to regurgitate 3 5 million homes that foreclosed that gives us 3 5 million more homes on the market than we need
7756877 historically we get about 800 000 new homebuyers naturally in this country because of household formation demographics marriages divorces kids and the like if you believe they all bought new we would still have 3 7 million more homes than we need thats the real issue
7756878 if you really wanted to get granular you can chart out what happens rather easily the default

7756880 the shift in earnings continues with energy contributing 25 1 of the s amp p 500s operating earnings during the second quarter up from 16 4 a year ago

7756882 basepoint analytics a fraud analysis and consulting service analyzed loans that were originated between 2002 and 2006 nearly 1 million alt a loans and 3 million nonprime loans were evaluated the relative fraud loss rate of alt a loans was more than three times higher than nonprime loans losses within alt a loans were caused by income misrepresentations employment frauds straw buyers investor related frauds and occupancy frauds
7756883 arguably fraud is more pervasive in alt a as 83 of the alt a universe was limited documentation loans such as stated income vs 45 of subprime

7756885 on jan 20 2009 when senator obama becomes the next president of the united states it will be the second anniversary of my sons death
7756886 the only way i can make any sense of this death to make any good come from this death is to make sure senator obama is our next president
7756887 he had an obligation to his country by attending west point and he would honor it

7756900 for so many individuals to die like this is tragic

7756902 they were on a mission of service and this tragedy will leave a huge hole in the hearts of family and friends and communities they served
7756903 everybodys having a hard time its hard to put into words how devastating this is

7756911 at this point we havent really fixed a label to it

7756913 its just a waste of everybodys time in general were playing the colts in two weeks weve got the browns this week and thats what were focused on as a team
7756914 im not used to sitting out but its something you learn from and ive gotten better from it and ill be a better player in the end
7756915 you learn the tempo what to expect on game day how stuff changes on game day because as much film as you want to watch during the week teams are going to throw extra stuff at you so its been good in that regard
7756916 i know we have the guys that can turn it up
7756917 but you dont want to talk about being someone who can flip the switch theres no excuse for the way we played last week
7756918 thats an opportunity you flip the switch and you play hard you play hard and you hone your techniques and the things that youre supposed to be doing we didnt do that so flip the switch or not we need to be ready come indy
7756919 i would like to be out there a lot more
7756920 but sometimes you have to get the other guys some work and get them going if i have to take a back seat and get some spot work here and there i guess my time has to be in the classroom and studying and learning

7756946 this white paper originated from an observation and a supposition by jim baum a highly active and successful morris illinois small independent retailer his observation was that macro and micro trends affect the small independent entrepreneur differently than their large competitors his supposition is if small independents could just step back take a deep breath and think about whats really happening whats changing and whats just over the horizon they might act differently they might change how they do things they might experiment more to take advantage of new emerging opportunities they might see solutions more clearly they might find new ways to connect more closely to their marketplace

7757160 the us dollar weakened significantly against other major currencies in 2007 and according to some economists is expected to depreciate further in 2008
7757161 as a consequence other currencies particularly the euro are poised to weaken the us dollars dominance as the currency of choice for international remittances and payments

7757169 ratifying the compact could allow great lakes water to no longer be held within the public trust and instead be defined as a product for commercial use
7757170 i want to thoroughly understand the lasting impact this compact could have on great lakes water for years to come it took the governors more than three years to get this done so it is not unreasonable for congress to take the time necessary to make sure we are not opening the door for the commercialization of great lakes water
7757171 the water protection standards in the compact make several desperately needed reforms in water law including water conservation environmental protection and integration of ground and surface water management im confident that these standards will be enforced because the compact specifically provides for citizen enforcement
7757172 its the 11th hour for the great lakes compact but lets be sure its not the 11th hour for the great lakes before the u s house acts on the compact this fall congress needs to take steps to assure the document doesnt expose this magnificent ecosystem to commercial exploitation

7757179 the council of small business has correctly highlighted the farcical nature of the grocerychoice website
7757180 they make the point that the site is misleading consumers because there is no reference to any specific stores
7757181 the sad reality is that this website could have a detrimental impact on the supermarket sector by providing free promotion to the major supermarket retailers
7757182 the website does not take into account the consumer savings from the convenience of independent stores and it does not take into account the price variations which exist within the independent sector and at different coles and woolworths stores
7757183 what that tells us is that consumers believe it is of no use at all
7757184 there is actually an agreement concluded between the two parties over the definite date which is 2011 to end any foreign presence on iraqi soil
7757185 there is an agreement between the two sides that there will be no foreign soldiers in iraq after 2011
7757186 agree to disagree maliki bush admin clash on status of pullout agreement
7757187 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7757188 no foreign soldier remains in iraq after a specific deadline not an open time frame
7757189 any decisions on troops will be based on the conditions on the ground in iraq that has always been our position and continues to be our position
7757190 there is no agreement until there is an agreement signed
7757191 optimistic that iraq and the u s can reach a mutual agreement on flexible goals
7757192 we dont want the phrase time horizons we are not comfortable with that phrase
7757193 stopped talking about the withdrawal of combat troops we just talk about withdrawals
7757194 no foreign soldiers will stay on the land of iraq
7757195 naturally i would have liked to have had a clean slate but i wont question it
7757196 will prompt the mayor to kind of join the team
7757197 all i know is that it might be a serious blast many of the fire brigades of nearby towns have been mobilized to help
7757198 if daw aung san suu kyi continues to refuse food from her comrades her health will be of serious concern
7757199 two people living with daw aung san suu kyi are also refusing food the international communitys immediate action is necessary
7757200 these people are criminals and they must be brought to the bar of justice and apprehended
7757201 the milf central command suffers from serious credibility problems which they must resolve against criminal atrocities committed by their fighters
7757202 now that theyve been split into small groups and its a very guerrilla like operation you need better communication really with better leadership to put them together
7757203 they cant just blame the government for this they have to do theyre own housecleaning or housekeeping and really show that theyre one
7757204 we are asking the milf to address that problem otherwise it might only show that they are not very capable in entering into an agreement with us
7757205 with any situation that occurs of that scale or even smaller we always step back and take a minute to assess and see if there is anything we should do differently
7757206 but every year were evaluating what we do and we continue to work on how we can improve our educational outreach to students none of that has changed we had a good working policy in place
7757207 students said they would support 40 to 65 a semester
7757208 well invite students from various constituencies sororities and fraternities athletics student housing off campus housing to get different views about what works where safety is concerned
7757209 you know bad things can happen and you try your best to be prepared and to educate students what to do in case of threats or violent behavior
7757210 but if youre asking me because of one abnormal act do we now change everything we do id say no because weve been training residence hall assistants for five years on roommate issues and we have good policies and practices in place
7757211 this was a property crime complaint there was no threat of violence she wasnt a flight risk and we knew where she was
7757212 team indicted tom delay and wrecked his career based on statutes that werent even on the books at the time the conduct took place
7757213 you ask people struggling to pay their grocery or gasoline bills whether a check is money and you are certainly going to get an earful
7757214 they kept a chinese wall between corporate money and individual money
7757215 created any real obstacle to our prosecution of all of the defendants
7757216 were pleased with the gist of the courts ruling because it undermines the money laundering prosecutions
7757217 we are here for one purpose to give the party momentum going into the general election so that come november barack obama will become the president of the united states
7757218 now in a first for me im supporting a republican john mccain i respect his maverick and independent streak and now hes the one with the experience and judgment
7757219 im here to tell you my name is hillary clinton and i do not support this message
7757220 if he wants to win the election he needs to get the vast majority of hillary supporters her strongest support is where hes weakest white working class men and women
7757221 there is no stronger surrogate for senator obama among senator clintons supporters than senator clinton
7757222 so we are confident as we come through this convention that our party will come together it might take a little time for some people to come around but we cant let the few voices distort the vast majority of her supporters that i do believe support senator obama
7757223 many are coming our way it will take a little longer
7757224 could i just mention to you jay that i spent five and a half years in a prison cell i didnt have a house i didnt have a kitchen table i didnt have a table i didnt have a chair
7757225 i spent those five and a half years not because i wanted to get a house when i got back home
7757226 hes a guy who barely got out of high school fought in world war ii in the army came home and made a business and made the american dream
7757227 we spend our time in a condominium in washington a condominium in phoenix some time over here in the state of california and then we have a place up in northern arizona
7757228 and my friends im proud of my record of service to this country and it has nothing to do with houses
7757229 the white house was saved by the action of one brave soldier john mccain
7757230 i know youve been asking about who i want to be my running mate
7757231 wouldnt it be good to have a person you dont know what party theyre with they have no political principles whatsoever they may need a job about that time
7757232 i brought a special friend a great american success story
7757233 hes from puerto rico married 15 years and has children ages 14 12 and 10 one of his songs i know youre familiar with
7757234 a man of few words with a lot of action
7757235 im here to endorse sen mccain because i believe in his ideals and his proposals to lead this nation
7757236 the collaboration between our institutions has led to some exciting discoveries
7757237 our members have worked together to develop new ways to identify and characterize cancers which we can use for better diagnosis better treatments and better monitoring of how effective the treatments are together weve also developed a graduate training program in cancer biology
7757238 this collaboration between human and animal cancer centers has been going on for more than 20 years and it is unprecedented in the united states
7757239 we are very distinct universities located miles apart who have decided that our cancer research collaboration will not only benefit the people of colorado but all americans we are making great strides in cancer research together
7757240 he knew of a study for dogs that involved implanting these radioactive seeds near the tumor

7757246 like a series of ghostly moving images in ones childhood memory
7757247 for all the rewards magnified by a close listen theres also more evidence of a band prone to apathy and limpness
7757248 this film suffers something of an identity crisis which is strangely apropos
7757249 crafts building rousing melodies with some darker tones beneath their dramatic surface
7757250 arrangements are complex and full augmented by the moans of lap steel and peals of piano
7757251 if you like your pessimism served up with a shot of wry it will satisfy your darkest cravings
7757252 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7757253 i think were being punished for being a red state
7757254 the consensus is the closer you are the more important you are
7757255 the only worse thing would be to sit outside and watch it on a big screen
7757256 i would hope they arent putting more emphasis on guam and alaska
7757257 after eight years of a republican white house once again its the economy stupid
7757258 at a time when some oil companies are pumping our pockets for record profits and some corporate ceos are raking in millions we need a sound economic plan that will put hardworking texans first and foremost
7757259 seriously worried about whether or not theyre going to keep their jobs keep their homes
7757260 how many of you need your staffs to count your homes for you
7757261 we can be a country that can be guided by the failed policies of trickle down economics or a country led by the fair and right policy of percolate up economics
7757262 when i talk to people in my neighborhood theyre saying its all of it the economy universal health care and gas prices
7757263 is thinking about it every time they get in their car
7757264 its just not a good idea for people running for president of the united states who potentially could be the role model for a lot of people to talk about their personal failings while they were kids because it opens the doorway to other kids thinking well i can do that too
7757265 its ok to do some of this stuff dont go overboard but it wont cost you later
7757266 it was kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7757267 i dont feel like they should be cause we already have locked doors and cameras but i didnt feel threatened by it
7757268 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun even police officers need years of training in hostage situations
7757269 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7757270 the magnetic field of the earth has to be considered as a factor
7757271 of course the question arises whether humans show also such a spontaneous behavior
7757272 the cows that were in the pasture were all over the place about two thirds were north south
7757273 its premature to say that it was a valid threat or that these folks have the ability to carry it out

7757277 is in the best interests of grey wolf shareholders customers and employees
7757278 it was really tough for someone who just came back from iraq
7757279 najats ability to speak kurdish and arabic is a priceless asset to every mission we execute
7757280 every mission najat takes on is accomplished with the utmost professionalism and exceeds all expectations of this command
7757281 ive personally felt they have a strong story to tell and thats their strength
7757282 it would have been harder for me to accomplish what we have now
7757283 u s recession and recovery u v or w shaped
7757284 theres been debate about whether its v shaped or u shaped
7757285 trying to make a desperate situation look sort of technical its not that much of a fuss the big boys can take care of it dont you worry
7757286 except the big boys here their trousers are getting a little short im afraid
7757287 this could extend itself well into 2009 with repercussions that could keep the country stagnant for two or three years
7757288 were not expecting this to be a hockey stick in the true sense of a hockey stick of a year at all

7757308 de boeing 737 die de verbinding bristol barcelona gerona verzekerde maakte in 5 minuten tijd een duik van 8 000 meter als gevolg van het probleem met de luchtdruk
7757309 has challenged the status quo and hes even criticized senator obama so its a tribute to senator obama that hes not just choosing a yes man but a person who will speak what he believes
7757310 she won millions of votes but isnt on the ticket why for speaking the truth
7757311 support of barack obama is clear she has said repeatedly that barack obama and she share a commitment to changing the direction of the country getting us out of iraq and expanding access to health care john mccain doesnt its interesting how those remarks didnt make it into his ad
7757312 has a high regard for senator clinton shes going to be an important voice in this campaign shes going to be an important voice in moving this country forward in the next administration but he felt senator biden would be the best fit for him at this time
7757313 hes an independent guy who will tell the president what he needs to know even if he doesnt want to hear it
7757314 tremendous groundbreaking figure everyone admires her greatly he is going to need her in the senate
7757315 a good team personality wise they complement each other well i think youre going to see them really enjoying being out on the trail together
7757316 now you pick someone who is a consummate washington insider who was elected to the u s senate when barack obama and i were 12 years old
7757317 the convention will give us an opportunity to reach out to those people hillary is going to be 100 percent for him
7757318 now three years later our country is still mired in the middle east were talking about more war more cold war and russia and georgia and invading iran and pakistan
7757319 he has this air of perfection and joe biden is more down to earth
7757320 its a total diss to sen clinton in my opinion
7757321 it just speaks volumes about how barack obama doesnt stand for anything
7757322 most people feel that if she wanted to press to be vice president she would have made a bigger push for it
7757323 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton
7757324 you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7757325 and it seems to me that for whatever reason that hasnt been explained a choice was made out of weakness than strength
7757326 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
7757327 she was upset and quite frank about putting her cards on the table
7757328 the obama people are perfectly happy to have our support but their attitude seems to be we can win without you and i guess thats why none of us is going from rah rah hillary to rah rah obama
7757329 it was a platonic type of endorsement shes just doing what shes supposed to be doing
7757330 there is no doubt in anyones mind that this is barack obamas convention
7757331 in mondays it blogwatch we discover that ohios voting machine irregularities arent mcafees fault after all not to mention misspelled
7757332 that kind of made my reputation as someone who can get outside our little focus area
7757333 vendor consolidation such as oracle corp s acquisition of peoplesoft has required it professionals to look to user groups for information
7757334 it professionals can use their user groups to understand what others are doing in the face of consolidation
7757335 there has been a lot of interest from oracle in what customers think
7757336 a few days back red hats red hat enterprise linux and fedora servers were broken into we still dont know
7757337 the concern a lot of us have is relative to last year a large number of transactions involve houses that have been foreclosed on
7757338 its cold comfort to know that the banks are succeeding on selling their houses at prices that are pretty breathtaking
7757339 id never say that but alaska has the talent theyve got the engineers theyve got the corrosion focus and weve now got the risk assessment process we need to prioritize
7757340 to look at congress and look at the american people and say that we made a huge mistake and were sorry thats hard thats very hard
7757341 once the most powerful woman in the world of oil
7757342 time and taxpayer dollars will be better spent encouraging the democratic led congress to take action on sound responsible environmental legislation than by introducing new lawsuits
7757343 we think we can prevent a problem that could have as much impact as the s amp l crisis
7757344 we were dealing with the issue as best we could back then

7757366 the west has been saying it wont allow russia to join the wto until it pulls out its troops from georgia
7757367 virtually saying we dont want wto membership on these terms
7757368 we should inform our partners of the need to exit some agreements that currently contradict the interests of the russian federation
7757369 we see virtually no advantages but we are carrying a burden
7757370 that does not mean we should abandon our strategic goals of moving toward wto but we must be clear when dealing with our partners

7757383 i hate to see the day when they walk away but the car will keep running
7757384 we believe hes right in line with our mission of quality journalism so in that regard i am excited for sacramento
7757385 actually i was amazed to see this opportunity come up
7757386 and sacramento fits into my familys lifestyle were outdoorsy people we love to ski and snowboard and were into water sports
7757387 there are so many interesting issues right now in california including gay marriage the budget
7757388 and youve got the upcoming presidential election im excited to be there for that
7757389 people have many options for getting their news but they still like to get information from local tv because it reflects their community
7757390 this gives me time to hit the ground running in sacramento
7757391 i look at the economy and gas prices and i think if we can just reach those people they need our merchandise and compared with driving to garage sales people can do one stop shopping here
7757392 people are torn between buying gas and buying school clothes i know that
7757393 weve increased our business over this time last year but we have fewer donations and smaller donations weve been ill affected by the recession
7757394 a lot of our customer base are people who dont need anything but they like to come and browse
7757395 a lot of them are depression generation theyve stopped coming in because they dont yet see an end in sight to our economic problems
7757396 i know there are a lot of people who could benefit from our store
7757397 they know if they can get it for less they can get more of it in my neighborhood we all know about this store
7757398 i dont think everybody is going to be a resale shopper
7757399 you do see younger people in here but mostly its older customers

7757401 society is never geared to people who grow a beard or little girls with holes in their ears theyre liable to hunt you down and dress you in a wedding gown and offer substantial careers theyll buy you a suit of clothes and pay to get another nose so no one will turn you away

7757408 if you like your pessimism served up with a shot of wry it will satisfy your darkest cravings
7757409 youre here to learn and focus on education youre going to have to confirm to a standardized code of dress in the real world so we might as well start now they can dress like they want to on the weekend or after school
7757410 i cannot find shirts for girls with three buttons and no logos
7757411 i dont blame the school i blame her mom for letting her walk out like that
7757412 im going to be totally hot if i have to come up to school and get my girls out of school for a button
7757413 it doesnt matter if you come from a million dollar home or a 50 000 home
7757414 it was that excitement that lead me to want to join the honors college on a full time basis
7757415 its sort of scary to have a mathematician in the house
7757416 i think being a mathematician probably made me an interesting choice and that line of questioning did come up
7757417 the fact is dont pigeon hole me as a mathematician take me as a whole person
7757418 our dean is a classicist i mean he has green eggs and ham in latin on his desk for crying out loud and so he comes into this office and i have the book of nothing and other interesting bizarro books
7757419 if i can do half as good as she does ill be successful
7757420 its possible but highly unlikely indiana will become a swing state
7757421 i think the republican party as a whole is more organized a lot of people who once supported obama are starting to lose interest
7757422 since indiana is a swing state this year the state is going to get a lot of attention by the obama campaign
7757423 a lot of republicans are looking to vote democrat for obama people liked that we mattered in the primary and i think they are just tired of the same stuff in washington
7757424 the house is going to be renovated this year and we will move in late next spring early summer
7757425 im perfectly willing to move during the school year we have to be there so we can do orientation
7757426 the music building the garage you can already see the beginnings of a quad over there
7757427 i think that is a great testament to dan and how he handles himself on a daily basis
7757428 obviously weve moved up in the polls from where we finished last year
7757429 the teams that were picked at the top have some high quality players in key positions
7757430 im hoping that we can improve throughout the year and start maturing throughout the season for conference matches
7757431 i think people have realized the kind of talent that we have brought in
7757432 obviously were disappointed being the under age and being the first weekend on campus
7757433 its obviously a disappointing situation its a situation weve acted on and there will be consequences
7757434 began demanding a break because it was only his second day in muncie

7757437 i dont think sen obama believes that is an appropriate place to be drilling at the moment
7757438 this means an awful lot to us it is a great achievement that she has got there she is happy and we are happy
7757439 it is also a great achievement for the whole community its great that she is getting educational resources and that she can stay in her own community and catchment area
7757440 all i ever wanted was choice i think in this day and age everyone should be entitled to their own choice it nagle is a fine school with an excellent curriculum
7757441 the school has been very accommodating she has a key for her own bathroom and she has her own changing room
7757442 it only toughens our resolve to do an operation like this
7757443 the result of this operation thus far has been a huge blow to the enemys ability to plant major ieds and more to plant them along highway 1 in southern kandahar
7757444 its thrown them off balance and well continue to maintain the momentum to keep them off balance in that specific area
7757445 this is our last hurrah this is the battlegroups last push to clear pashmul
7757446 it is literally a massive reflection of how far the canadian army has come over the last few years
7757447 all these individuals have said they wont even attempt to make a claim for compensation because they will be found out by the taliban and they will be killed
7757448 this is a historically significant operation for this rotation and its effects are very important in the context of the campaign at this time
7757449 endeavour to carry out any searches as quickly as possible
7757450 this is a very sensitive time for all our communities and we are working hard to ensure everyone is kept up to date with as much information as we can give
7757451 ensure people are kept updated in relation to the investigation
7757452 its the closest thing to living in a big city
7757453 its more spacious than i thought for the record my friends are going to be jealous
7757454 this adds to the middle gap in that its rental and not condo
7757455 theres high end and low end downtown but we have a deficit in the middle one north fifth is a big move in that direction
7757456 i paid exactly the same price as in philadelphia and i get a bigger apartment and a nice view its a new place its right next to the transportation center
7757457 it had a dingy prisonlike feel to it we took out as many walls as we could it completely opened up the space
7757458 taking the concrete balcony off opens it from the outside and lets more light in
7757459 thats the biggest thing theyre not deterred by a lot of the normal stuff
7757460 people that have already been through redevelopment can see what it takes to make something happen
7757461 there is still great skepticism to downtown among local developers i visited with homer williams he told me the pearl district was in worse condition 20 years ago than our downtown
7757462 i think at the time in 2006 a lot of people looking at projects were blinded by rising residential prices and building costs if you thought about it and unfortunately nobody thought about it except williams amp dame theres a dramatic need for affordable rental housing
7757463 the big part of that is its apartments not condos
7757464 most developers here dont understand the concept of building a community
7757465 williams amp dame understand the fact its not just one project out here everybody thinks of a 1 to 3 year process its a 10 to 20 year process
7757466 they identified the one type of project that could be done in this type of market
7757467 they have a long term vision for the area it worked for them more than it might for others
7757468 as far as im concerned teachers were trained to educate my children not carry a gun
7757469 i dont want my child looking over her shoulder wondering whos carrying a gun
7757470 kind of awkward knowing that some teachers were carrying guns
7757471 when you outlaw guns in a certain area the only people who follow that are law abiding citizens and everybody else ignores it
7757472 like a series of ghostly moving images in ones childhood memory
7757473 for all the rewards magnified by a close listen theres also more evidence of a band prone to apathy and limpness
7757474 this film suffers something of an identity crisis which is strangely apropos

7757478 he had all as and bs and loved ball state
7757479 i asked him who he voted for and he said george bush bill clinton and ross perot
7757480 i asked why he voted for three people and he said that way i know i could pick the winner
7757481 i cant claim to know what theyre going through because everyone goes through it a loss differently but i have a sense
7757482 but once we got to know him he was friendly and loved talking about music he had a zeal to learn how things worked throughout the station
7757483 in japan a black butterfly means itll carry your soul to heaven

7757490 the hope is that folks can easily find or perhaps be surprised at the number of organized and casual opportunities to play
7757491 a big programmatic goal for us is to increase our overall participation in all areas including fitness classes intramural sports information recreation like stopping in to swim or play basketball
7757492 there are few options of packages for fitness services with a nominal fee outside the campus gym setting
7757493 its a good way to sample programs figure out what you love and become more educated about fitness
7757494 its like taking a half step back to take 10 forward
7757495 with construction adding new programming will be a challenge but our reward will be outstanding facilities in the long term
7757496 i am paying anybody who have read the book there are no children here by alex kotlowitz 30 40 which in some classes you have to read at ub even more money if you have to read the book a little more to write a 3 4 page paper on a couple questions which was assigned

7757498 its a great opportunity to play in my hometown and in front of my home crowd
7757499 its a great honor to play for ball state and theres a lot of emotion it makes me appreciate all that extra work during the summer before my senior year and after my senior year to just prepare myself for this next level
7757500 hes not the biggest guy in the world but when he brings it he brings it
7757501 i think how he approaches the game and how he goes into a meeting and how he wants to learn and absorb as much as he can are all positives he works and studies the game
7757502 its been a very hard process coming back and having to get back into the swing of things and the flow of things im still just taking it one day at a time im trying to just get myself back into the flow of things
7757503 we had a hard time coming out of the gates
7757504 we attacked them and we were a lot more productive offensively but couldnt find the net
7757505 im glad that murphy is being challenged im glad that amy cleeter came in ready to contribute
7757506 i think we have things to work on but it was the season opener
7757507 to still pick us in the top three is a good thing
7757508 they respect us and know what we were capable of
7757509 i got a feeling there were a few neighbors mad at me

7757515 he the boys father was target practising with the gun and then somebody rang his mobile
7757516 the gun was ready to fire and he answered the phone
7757517 rashids sister is really active and she got hold of the gun and pointed it at her brother he was on the high ground and she was on the low ground it hit him right in the middle of the back of his head
7757518 as a parent of three youngsters i know that beyond doubt this is every parents worst nightmare
7757519 no matter the circumstances everyones prayers and thoughts should be with little rashid and his family

7757686 let me get this straight im stuck up and a snob according to you because i refuse to deal with oh let me think here your aunts who never once made me feel welcomed in their homes because your grandfather constantly held me up as an example for their chicken head daughters to emulate im stuck up and a snob because i refuse to deal with your cousin whose insecurities took over when her man kept using my tattoos as an excuse to keep feeling up on me the same cousin who talked mad shit about my uncle to your family and why was she talking shit because some friend of hers caught a beat down from my uncle for trying to sell drugs in my building but did she ever bother to mention that part no she didnt im a snob because i refused to go to your cousin georges cook out because when we were first introduced he sneered and rolled his eyes at me like i owed him money
7757687 what youre really asking me to do is to swallow my pride and be a hypocrite
7757688 look dude i dont want to talk to you as of now youre on probation
7757689 look i dont mean to offend you but your family is full of shit all of this sudden concern about them wanting to get to know mia is bullshit they speak with their mouths not their hearts do you want to know why i say this
7757690 think back to a couple of weeks ago when we were at your grandfathers funeral
7757691 how many of your cousins or aunts for that matter approached mia to say hello not one although your aunts sure as hell bum rushed my husband a few minutes after we got there to say hello to him hug him and thank him for coming as far as i know theyd only met my husband once while theyve seen mia a bunch of times the only people that approached mia at all were your mom and step dad so please tell me again how much your family wants to know mia
7757692 my mom and step father love mia and he has never liked any of my girlfriends
7757693 dont interrupt yes that is exactly what you want her to do so that your family will approve of her i got news for you my daughter doesnt need your familys approval she is better than all of them put together
7757694 i cant say i blame her if you wouldve called me a stuck up snob i wouldve made you swallow your teeth but then again my kid is a better person than i am oh by the way the way i hear they have a gum for ass kissers it masks the bad breath that ass kissing leaves behind

7757950 when one company has the pricing power that google has thats going to negatively impact the roi equation for advertisers in canada we do expect that prices will go up

7757971 we continue to investigate the root cause of the issue including but not limited to the third party website that has allegedly facilitated this illegal exchange of information
7757972 given the dire situation facing local communities dependent on the lower lakes
7757973 were already doing that we have already announced that and we will work with that community
7757974 what are we doing for the lower lakes well were not simply offering 50 million

7757977 i am surprised that swimming queensland is talking about funding cuts because i met with the ceo of swimming queensland just a week and a half ago
7757978 i talked to him about its funding arrangements i said that i was happy to reconsider the future funding arrangements of that organisation
7757979 the funding for any sport is what we need because we need kids to be out there and doing exercise
7757980 im a pretty big believer in kids getting out there and doing stuff if the funding is not there then were not going to be able to do that which is sad news
7757981 with swimming its a pretty full time thing and you dont have time to have a job or anything like that
7757982 so the funding is really important for us and swimming doesnt really get paid that much compared to other sports
7757983 in the swim team all the people who won gold medals are from queensland
7757984 we want to return tax competitiveness to business and the people of this state

7757987 we need to not only develop the north but populate the north

7757995 the chicago music scene was very exciting its such a big city and it was very welcoming but the portland music scene is great
7757996 theres a lot of people who play a similar kind of music and the label im on hush has a lot of really nice people on it
7757997 that really built my sound i feel like they really added a lot to how the last record sounded
7757998 i was moving for some of the time while i was writing those and i was in a new relationship also so there were a lot of things to write about there was leaving friends and a new love
7757999 my friends and i would do a correspondence sort of like a blog called the getalong one moved to southern illinois and one moved to la and one stayed in chicago and i moved to portland so that song is really about just moving away and keeping in touch
7758000 as many have shared that similar experience of attempting to stay connected to friends i try to do a mix of biographical and general
7758001 which took nearly two years from idea to release i feel different because im very settled now i live in a house now and i just feel more stable

7758014 to start colleges want to see a full class load which generally means at least five academic courses again academic courses are english math science social studies and foreign language so generally admissions officers are looking for at least one of each there are definitely students with tough loads with only four traditionally academic courses but in general five is the preferred number and its not unusual to see students who take six or rarely even seven
7758015 its better to get an a in an ap course
7758016 admissions and courses to ap or not ap or ib
7758017 the rankings are not terribly useful and are basically just ways to sell magazines
7758018 one of the great economic success stories of our time
7758019 its at least possible even reasonably possible that the grading scale in class means very very very little to your gpa that if they changed the grading scale youd have still gotten that c for the work you did the night before it was due and consider yourself lucky mister
7758020 so what does that all mean sure its possible that grading or weighting scales might make some difference in the admission process especially for colleges that focus more on numbers than perhaps they should but ive found fairly few of those at the very competitive institutions in most cases we are doing intensive evaluations of your academic record incorporating grading scales weighting systems course load and difficulty trends in grades and when available how you rank in your class
7758021 i realize of course that parents students and teachers will want to explain why the c level grades on this application arent really fair and that really the student would have an a average at any other school district

7758025 i often joke with foreign interviewers and say that our level of human performance is second in the world
7758026 number one is north korea their performances are totally uniform and uniformity in this way brings beauty we chinese can do it too after hard training and strict discipline chinese achieve that as well
7758027 they only work four and a half days each week every day there are two coffee breaks and no one can suffer any discomfort because of human rights
7758028 this caused me no end of worry one week i thought everything had been rehearsed completely without any problems but in fact they could not even stand in straight lines
7758029 you couldnt criticize them either they all belong to organizations some kind of institutions unions we do not have that we can work very hard and can put up with a lot of pain
7758030 we can achieve in one week what they can achieve in one month thats the reason our performers give such brilliant performances i think other than north korea no other country anywhere in the world can achieve this
7758031 only the chinese have the pride discipline the unity of the people amp the unity of purpose that could pull off something as big
7758032 only the chinese have the pride discipline the unity of the people amp the unity

7758043 john mccains campaign hit back at madonna on sunday after the pop diva kicked off her world tour with a concert that bracketed the us presidential candidate with adolf hitler
7758044 mccain campaign spokesman tucker bounds angrily condemned the segment of madonnas concert in cardiff on saturday that appeared to draw a comparison between mccain hitler and zimbabwean strongman robert mugabe
7758045 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
7758046 it clearly shows that when it comes to supporting barack obama his fellow worldwide celebrities refuse to consider any smear or attack off limits
7758047 madonnas apparent swipe at mccain came during a performance of the song
7758048 antioxidants sit within this tiny trojan horse protecting it from attack from digestive juices in the stomach once in the small intestine the nanoparticle gets sticky and bonds to the intestinal wall it then leaks its contents directly into the intestinal cells which allows them to be absorbed directly into the blood stream
7758049 we hope that by mastering this technique drugs and supplements also vulnerable to the digestive process can be better absorbed by the human body
7758050 for some people having a fry up might seem like a good way to start the day but if you are doing this regularly then you are significantly increasing your risk of bowel cancer which is one of the most common cancers
7758051 only a third of people are aware of the link between processed meat and cancer which means two thirds are not in a position to make an informed choice about how much of it they eat
7758052 this is not a question of all or nothing because the more processed meat you eat the greater your risk for example if you eat 150g of it a day then you will be increasing your bowel cancer risk by about two thirds
7758053 but if you only eat 50g a day roughly the equivalent of a sausage then you will be increasing your risk by about a fifth
7758054 whose experience in the civil rights movement was a loss of face and the humiliation of being seen as an immoral people and that doesnt go away
7758055 it has been forgotten that the reason why he king is a hero and a great american is because he weathered the status of being the most hated man in america thats not how we choose to remember it

7758059 were going to continue to review what we will do about the various elements of the relationship with russia as you know weve been very focused on what to do for georgia weve been making certain that theres a clear message that there arent going to be any new lines in europe
7758060 we found high levels of uncertainty around many aspects of the crime
7758061 and you cannot help but think that the public is taking this uncertainty on to juries resulting in more acquittals
7758062 moreover out of those cases that do make it to court in comparison to all other crimes child sexual assault has the highest acquittal rate of defendants in higher courts
7758063 we call this the csi effect where people expect physical evidence to make a conviction but these cases dont work like this
7758064 it may be the case that rather than people having misconceptions they may simply not know enough
7758065 however the high levels of uncertainty experienced by those surveyed could easily turn into misconceptions if not addressed and in turn contribute to unsuccessful convictions in child sexual assault cases
7758066 we are spending our childrens inheritance with fuel costs as they are now there will be nothing left
7758067 we broke down in mongolia just on the onset of winter in a snow storm
7758068 we got a coal truck from the local coal mine to tow us 100km over a 7 000 feet 2 134 metres foot mountain pass in freezing and snowing conditions
7758069 in russia one guy jumped out of his truck and he waved so frantically i thought theres something wrong we must have the front wheel falling off
7758070 as we pulled up he pulled out a bottle of vodka which hed brought for us
7758071 we had a sheet which said in russian we are australians driving around the world can we park here tonight and they would read it and then they would burst into the most beautiful smile
7758072 they would insist that you stay there that you came in and had a sauna with them all night they would be knocking on the door offering dried fish artefacts and the most incredible things and not wanting you to leave
7758073 people who know dick know he has a very short attention span but it was absolutely fantastic i had him trapped and he couldnt get away so we had the most wonderful conversations

7758076 the kindle revolution feels awfully evolutionary if it exists at all
7758077 i dont see kindles around in the real world neither do i and ive never heard anyone express the desire to own one i have but not at the current 349 price even if kindle matches the first year sales of the ipod i cant imagine the kindle approaching the unit sales or cultural impact of apples music player went on to have

7758090 this latest evidence needs to be considered in light of two separate tests conducted by the transport accident investigation commission which each reached different conclusions and which the commission itself accepted could therefore not be relied upon ms taylor said
7758091 the reality is that today the mac platform is relatively safe there are hundreds of thousands of viruses and other malicious software programs floating around for windows but less than 200 are known to target the mac and many of those are aimed at versions of the mac os prior to mac os x and thus have no effect on a modern mac its not that mac os x is inherently more secure against viruses than current versions of windows although it was clearly more secure than windows prior to xp sp2 the numerous vulnerabilities reported and patched in recent years are just as exploitable as their windows equivalents but most security experts agree that malicious software these days is driven by financial incentives and its far more profitable to target the most dominant platform

7758208 ook een afronding is helemaal niet nodig gezien wij alles tot op de cent kunnen berekenen en betalen het is natuurlijk voor een ieder wel lastig om te wennen aan nieuwe psychologische prijsgrenzen

7758433 mr barak has once again underlined the fact that israel cannot accept that iran acquires nuclear capability israel refuses to rule out any options
7758434 the united states must continue to impose effective economic sanctions on tehran with the goal of preventing iran from building nuclear arms

7758469 because it had become a media circus where his voice was not being heard
7758470 we feel he is a victim of small town values ganging up against a foreigner he was targeted because he was serb and a very large man
7758471 hes a gentle guy and he was happy to go to america
7758472 he was on a full scholarship he was scouted in serbia to play basketball
7758473 willing to return to the states to face the law
7758474 the authorities are not looking for him he is not staying at home because it is a media circus here
7758475 we would have been happy if he had accepted american values and if after he had finished university he wanted to stay there
7758476 we are sad that steinhauer is hurt and we pray that he will get better and live his life to the best

7758478 hes good at harassing people and making noise ceos give him his way because it is a lot easier than confronting him
7758479 thats the old shakedown theory that the anti civil rights forces have used against us forever
7758480 why cant they come up with one company that says that no one has criticized me
7758481 his way of doing things was if were going to support you and youre not going to support us then we have to focus on telling the african american community not to spend their money
7758482 the kind of guy you can sit down and talk to
7758483 we will not allow you to enslave our communities mr ratner
7758484 you must meet with us you must come to terms with the poverty you are creating using public dollars
7758485 just because pepsi and other companies had me on their board advising them didnt mean that i wasnt blasting them all the time
7758486 look at forest city ratner i blasted them and they came up with one of the best community agreements for blacks and latinos
7758487 each of these local chapters can now hit up businesses for support in their communities
7758488 wal mart has in no way tried to persuade me with money

7758496 structural quality of a work of art resulting from the artists method of using medium
7758497 that conclusion came in the courts reinstatement of two convictions one of a man accused of making a series of bomb threats in macon and another man accused in the death of his 3 month old daughter in dekalb county
7758498 prior panels had found that the defendants had been deprived of their constitutional right to counsel when trial judges allowed them to represent themselves despite their indications they wanted a free lawyer just not the one they had been assigned may give trial judges some comfort about defendants who represent themselves even when they vacillate over whether thats what they want to do
7758499 moreover a u s supreme court decision in june could still curb judges exercise of their freedom to take defendants refusal to get along with appointed counsel as a waiver of the right to a lawyer
7758500 hopefully well see more application of the edwards rule that you cant fire your trial counsel
7758501 and this would have been a nice one to start with
7758502 garey had asked u s district judge clay d land to disqualify his appointed lawyer scott c huggins of macon contending that huggins law office had been one of the targets in the alleged 2003 bomb threats land found there was no conflict of interest and gave garey two choices keep huggins or represent yourself
7758503 garey who has been described by his current counsel as being and by the 11th circuit as having paranoid personality disorder said he would involuntarily act as his own lawyer after a jury trial in which huggins served as stand by counsel garey was found guilty on various counts including obstruction of justice and threatening to use a weapon of mass destruction and sentenced to 30 years in prison
7758504 today we recognize it is possible for a valid waiver of counsel to occur not only when a cooperative defendant affirmatively invokes his right to self representation
7758505 but also when an uncooperative defendant rejects the only counsel to which he is constitutionally entitled understanding his only alternative is self representation with its many attendant dangers
7758506 she explained that the court didnt mean to encourage judges to make uncooperative defendants represent themselves judges simply have discretion to conclude a defendant has waived his right to counsel she wrote
7758507 noting the recent high court decision allowing judges to order defendants to keep their lawyers black wrote our

7758539 for a short time in the late 1990s glaad nominated and presented glaad media awards in lgbt media categories this created significant tension in glaads relationship with lgbt media outlets many of the outlets believed that glaad shouldnt be in the business of monitoring evaluating and judging their work that criticism combined with the fact that the vast majority of lgbt outlets did not submit material for nomination resulted in a decision to discontinue those awards in 1999 glaad reviewed this issue in mid 2006 and after consultation with a wide group of stakeholders including representatives from lgbt broadcast media outlets the glaad board of directors chose not to amend the existing position with regard to the glaad media awards program this was communicated to all who were consulted in that process by august of 2006

7758580 fidel must have a pact with god or the devil
7758581 a fascinating phenomenon in our centurys politics a man of panache a romantic figure an ever defiant dizzyingly imaginative and unpredictable rebel a marvelous actor a spectacular teacher and preacher of the many credos he says he embraces
7758582 no modern revolutionary or chief of state has undertaken such astounding personal risks and has been so directly engaged in the rigours of conspiracy rebellion and open warfare
7758583 if you like give me a ten dollar bill green american in the letter because never i have not seen a ten dollar bill green american
7758584 i am not going to deny that i enjoyed some of miamis magnificent comforts
7758585 for the first time i knew a t bone steak smoked salmon and those things that i a youth with a big appetite appreciated a lot
7758586 let me start by stating the things that do not motivate me
7758587 money does not motivate me material goods do not motivate me likewise the lust for glory fame and prestige does not motivate me i really think that ideas motivate me ideas convictions are what spur a man to struggle in the first place
7758588 i refuse even to think that my son may sleep a single night under the same roof sheltering my most repulsive enemies and receive on his innocent cheeks the kisses of those miserable judases
7758589 i am making this decision because i do not want in my absence to see my son fidelito fall into the hands of my most ferocious enemies and detractors who in an extreme act of villainy disgraced my home and sacrificed it to the blood tyranny they serve
7758590 if hes as good a leader as he was a father then poor cuba
7758591 condemn me it does not matter history will absolve me
7758592 he learned the very hard way in urban insurrection sierra war creating from those siege conditions a siege mentality for this hostility surrounded island where at least one half of the population is trained and organized today for defensive combat he also learned that to survive he must be absolutely and undeviatingly uncompromising
7758593 there was a moment when i was commander in chief of myself and two others
7758594 the notion of surrendering to the soldiers of the dictatorship of president fulgencio batista that he and the 81 rebels had arrived to overthrow never occurred to castro
7758595 on the contrary he had the inner certainty and triumph that only visionaries feel when the odds are impossibly and virtually mathematically arrayed against them
7758596 i got to know cubans problems you cant close your eyes to some things you have to make your decision and i made mine to help the cause of freedom in cuba
7758597 castro doesnt kick your pants off or jeer at you when he has you over a barrel
7758598 he is pretty reasonable if he believes you are in a mood to listen to what he has to say
7758599 kind treatment under those conditions is something you will remember for the rest of your life i know i will
7758600 i realize this is going to be my true destiny
7758601 there is not communism or marxism but representative democracy and social justice in a well planned country
7758602 we will not interfere with legitimate business but every arrangement made with batista will be investigated
7758603 whatever we may think of him he is going to be a great factor in the development of cuba and very possibly latin american affairs
7758604 he seems to be sincere he is either incredibly naive about communism or under communist discipline my guess is the former and i have already implied that his ideas as to how to run a government or an economy are less developed than those of almost any world figure i have seen
7758605 there is no more democratic government in latin america than the revolutionary government if mr kennedy does not like socialism we do not like imperialism we do not like capitalism
7758606 let the record show that our restraint is not exhaustible
7758607 it is clear that this nation in concert with all the free nations of this hemisphere must take an ever closer and more realistic look at the menace of external communist intervention and domination in cuba
7758608 was at worst a symptom and the most radical manifestation of the social and economic tensions existing in latin america one treats an illness by getting rid of its causes not by erasing its symptoms
7758609 the u s secretly urged diefenbaker to maintain normal relations because it was thought that canada would be well positioned to gather intelligence on the island in short prime minister diefenbaker was confident about canadas cuba policy not because he had stubbornly crossed the americans but precisely because he had earned their confidence
7758610 if surviving assassination attempts were an olympic event i would win the gold medal
7758611 i welcome the opportunity of having anyone assassinate fidel castro and any leader who is oppressing the people
7758612 the cuban revolution has ravaged the cuban family much as the civil war in the united states ravaged american families
7758613 i cannot remain indifferent to what is happening in my country
7758614 my brothers fidel and ra l have made it an enormous prison surrounded by water
7758615 was the last totally independent mind and spirit in the increasingly rigid power structure built by and around castro he had vanished from cuba in the early part of 1965 for reasons never adequately explained and therefore did not participate in the final stages of formalizing the establishment of communist rule in cuba through the creation of the new party under castro
7758616 we dont think intervention by outside countries in conflict is a good thing
7758617 viva cuba y el pueblo cubano viva el primer ministro comandante fidel castro
7758618 men of formidable intellect whose political idealism had inspired millions of their compatriots infuriated millions of others and changed the course of their nations history
7758619 we are witnessing sad things in other socialist countries very sad things
7758620 if they were everyone would be arrested things are not the way you imagine besides people do not want another party this country has had political education a revolutionary education people can speak their mind but not if they start conspiring or organizing terrorist plans
7758621 my only wish is to fight on as a soldier of ideas

7758624 lo m s preocupante es que esa visi n negativa del futuro no es abstracta sino que la tienen bas ndose en hechos concretos ocurridos a su alrededor como la muerte de un familiar amigo o conocido del barrio en un hecho delictivo o por el consumo de paco

7758649 people like hillary clinton who put those 18 million cracks in that glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7758650 this election we will listen to our hope instead of our fears this time we decide to stop doubting and to start dreaming this election time in this great country where a girl from the south side of chicago can go to college and law school and the son of a single mother from hawaii can go all the way to the white house we have committed ourselves to building the world as it should be

7758655 the moment the crime is committed there is an eclipse of humanity the moment is transient but paradoxically those framing the unspeakable become eternal there is nothing you can do it is done the day after i did not want to wake up and if i had the strength to put an end to my life i would have done it the shame of living after that day was very strong one does not believe in life anymore
7758656 our way to remedy the irremediable evil consists in the eclipse of humanity but at omid we acknowledge each victims humanity and create a space for empathy

7758662 islam in action five muslim women in pakistan buried alive in name of honour
7758663 i ask you to make the best of my deeds the last ones and the best of my life the end of it oh allah make the best of my days the day i meet you
7758664 the day when they will come out of the graves quickly as racing to a goal
7758665 you shall see mankind as in a drunken state yet they will not be drunken but severe will be the torment of allah
7758666 consider not that allah is unaware of that which the dhalimun polytheists wrong doers etc
7758667 how could this happen and how could allah allow it to happen
7758668 but he gives them respite up to a day when the eyes will stare in horror they will be hastening forward with necks outstretched their heads raised up towards the sky their gaze returning not towards them and their hearts empty from thinking because of extreme fear
7758669 warn them o muhammad of the day of the approaching doom when the hearts will be choking the throats
7758670 the command of allah has come up so do not seek to hasten it
7758671 on the day of resurrection the sun would draw so close to the people that there would be left only a distance of one mile
7758672 the people would be submerged in perspiration sweat according to their deeds some up to their knees some up to the waist and some would have the bridle of perspiration
7758673 and the day the wrongdoer will bite on his hands in regret he will say oh i wish i had taken with the messenger a way
7758674 and on the day when the hour will be established the mujrimun disbelievers sinners criminals polytheists etc will be plunged into destruction with deep regrets sorrows and despair
7758675 upon that day the ones who have disbelieved and disobeyed the messenger do like that the earth were leveled with them
7758676 when the disbeliever would say i wish that i were dirt
7758677 as for those who disbelieve their deeds are like a mirage in a desert
7758678 the thirsty one thinks it to be water until he comes up to it he finds it to be nothing but he finds allah with him who will pay him his due hell and allah is swift in taking account
7758679 or the state of a disbeliever is like the darkness in a vast deep sea overwhelmed with a great wave topped by a great wave topped by dark clouds darkness one above another if a man stretches out his hand he can hardly see it and he for whom allah has not appointed light for him there is no light
7758680 the likeness of what they spend in this world is the likeness of a wind which is extremely cold it struck the harvest of a people who did wrong against themselves and destroyed it i e the good deed of a person is only accepted if he is a monotheist and believes in all the prophets of allah including christ and muhammad saw allah wronged them not but they wronged themselves
7758681 isnt allah just wont he reward the people according to their deeds
7758682 it was not allah who wronged them but they wronged themselves
7758683 the parable of those who disbelieve in their lord is that their works are as ashes on which the wind blows furiously on a stormy day they shall not be able to get aught of what they have earned that is the straying far away from the right path
7758684 and we shall turn to whatever deeds they disbelievers polytheists sinners etc did and we shall make such deeds as scattered floating particles of dust
7758685 say shall we inform you who will be the greatest losers by their works those whose effort go astray in the life of the world and yet they reckon that they do good work
7758686 and the day whereon we shall gather them all together then we shall say to those who did set partners in worship with us stop at your place
7758687 so sufficient is allah for a witness between us and you that we indeed knew nothing of your worship of us
7758688 and remember the day when he will gather them all together and then will say to the angels was it you that these people used to worship
7758689 and remember when allah will say on the day of resurrection o iesa jesus son of maryam mary
7758690 never did i say to them aught except what you allah did command me to say worship allah my lord and your lord and i was a witness over them while i dwelt amongst them but when you took me up you were the watcher over them and you are a witness to all things if you punish them they are your slaves and if you forgive them verily you only you are the all mighty the all wise
7758691 and they all shall appear before allah on the day of resurrection then the weak will say to those who were arrogant chiefs verily we were following you can you avail us anything from allahs torment
7758692 and allah has brought you out from the wombs of your mothers while you know nothing
7758693 and he gave you hearing sight and hearts that you might give thanks to allah
7758694 allah subhaana wa taaala does not want anyone to give up their freedom and material force and power however strong it is cannot enslave a person who wants freedom the most this worldly power can do is to inflict pain on the body by hurting the body or imprisoning the body or tormenting or punishing that body but the soul is free the mind is free and nobody can enslave it
7758695 who can make those weak people follow the strong the arrogant in belief and in behavior when allah is the one who created them and allah is the one who is sustaining them and providing them no one can do that only their weak spirits
7758696 they are not weak because they have less power than the strong they are weak because they wanted to be weak they are weak because the weakness is in their hearts and in their spirits how many are the weak many and how many are the tyrants a few who gave those few tyrants over authority over the many masses the tyrants cannot make the masses slaves except for when the masses accept it it is the weak will that is missing from these herds imam anwar because they are like sheep
7758697 and those who disbelieve say to those who believe follow our way and we will verily bear your sins never will they bear anything of their sins surely they are liars
7758698 and verily they shall bear their own loads and other loads besides their own and verily they shall be questioned on the day of resurrection about that which they used to fabricate
7758699 and those who were arrogant will say to those who were deemed weak did we keep you back from guidance after it had come to you

7758713 when a recession hits businesses often cope with the changes by making budget cuts which can result in employees being laid off
7758714 those laid off employees are often some of the most affected consumers during a recession unlike their former employers cutting their budgets may not be enough to get through the tough times not preparing for these economic surprises in advance is a common problem because no one wants to think it will happen to them fortunately its a problem that can be alleviated starting today with a few changes
7758715 dimana ya mungkin di surga entahlah yang pasti allah mengawasi kita

7758720 aku mencintai allah dan rasulnya lebih dari aku mencintai diriku sendiri
7758721 saya mendengar rasulullah saw bersabda setiap unta yang digembalakan zakatnya setiap 40 ekor adalah seekor anak unta betina
7758722 the latest assessment pegs the number of terrorist training camps still operating across the border at about 40
7758723 one cannot be complacent as the terrorism network and infrastructure across the border remains intact and continues to function as before the terrorist camps have now been cleverly hidden and are being run covertly
7758724 despite continued infiltration attempts almost 150 since january by terrorist groups from across we have been able to foil most of these bids this summer this has caused a serious dent in the capability and motivation of terrorist outfits to initiate violence in j amp k
7758725 the situation is being assiduously exploited by inimical elements from the across the border to further fuel it
7758726 the need of the hour is to curb misinformation promote mutual appreciation of concerns and bring about reconciliation i am sure the current turmoil instigated by the marginalised separatists will be a short lived affair
7758727 the civil society and intellectuals appropriately assisted by the state administration will soon succeed in clearing the fog of misperceptions which will sooner than later lead to restoring normalcy and traditional harmony among communities
7758728 much would depend on the emerging equation between the newly elected government army and isi and the role each choose to play vis a vis relations with india we are however certain that strengthening of democracy in our neighbourhood will bode well for the entire region
7758729 tobacco companies today are hypocritical they claim to have programs on youth smoking prevention but still they advertise on public spaces and sponsor events where youths are exposed to
7758730 the way i look at it is i got one brain cell left and im gonna get that fucker tonight
7758731 i come here as a wife who loves my husband and believes he will be an extraordinary president
7758732 barack doesnt care where youre from or what your background is or what party if any you belong to thats not how he sees the world he knows that thread that connects us our belief in americas promise our commitment to our childrens future is strong enough to hold us together as one nation even when we disagree
7758733 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7758734 put those 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling so that our daughters and sons can dream a little bigger and aim a little higher
7758735 barack obama will close the book on the old politics of race and gender of group against group of straight against gay
7758736 if we feel peace inside ourselves maybe we will have peace
7758737 when we do such things it brings us closer to the people
7758738 the return is immeasurable we dont spend a lot of money and its immensely popular
7758739 you have to consider not just military dimensions but nonprofit organizations economics and civilian life we keep the peace with the local population we keep the peace together
7758740 the tae kwon do helps release their frustration and stress and give them what do you call it catharsis
7758741 then i hear someone outside one morning and i go outside and see a sign on my door that says theyre auctioning the house
7758742 and families who are very low income feel the costs of having to move even more than other people
7758743 the research shows that there are going to be more waves of these mortgages resetting and people wont be able to make the payments thats going to be devastating for these renters who have been in their homes in some cases for 10 or 15 years
7758744 i had spent a lot of money on that house put in a new dishwasher upgraded the plumbing
7758745 i took out so many personal loans from friends just to keep paying my bills that for a while i was just hiding in my house
7758746 i didnt want to answer the phone didnt want to answer the door
7758747 there is absolutely no cause for this no reason for this continuing divide
7758748 wilder said adding later that he came to the morning panel to
7758749 we learned coming out of the caucuses that sound bites can in fact be detrimental
7758750 so irrespective of what may or may not happen on the convention floor the problem is you might have two or three people who will say something and that may become the headline
7758751 the longer youre divided the longer it takes for us to get the ball rolling
7758752 weve only got four good prime time hours at this convention and were using one of them for this
7758753 all i can say is obamas a bigger man than i am
7758754 when former presidents come to a convention they talk about what they want to talk about
7758755 i know this is going to happen because hillary clinton is a professional
7758756 they might have a statue with hillary clinton and barack obama embracing
7758757 allow expanded oil exploration and extraction in the santa barbara county region
7758758 we didnt need the revenues property values were such that we were paying our own bills we didnt need the jobs employment was very sound but the threat to the tourist industry if we were going to have sticky beaches that would be a disaster
7758759 technology has preempted that last argument we do need the jobs we do need the money we do need the oil
7758760 by gradually and sensitively expanding offshore exploration and drilling the estimated revenue to the county runs in many millions of dollars
7758761 santa barbara city has been anti oil for 40 years and is still anti oil
7758762 why should we be opening up brand new areas when there are already leases the oil companies are sitting on
7758763 is a short sighted limited symbolic vote that would be in keeping with the whole confusion on the national level that we can drill our way out of this and that its the panacea
7758764 maybe theres an argument that if you expand offshore oil production you reduce the seeps and reduce marine pollution and provide california with more energy and the tax revenues to pay for the transition to solar energy and electric vehicles
7758765 i dont spend a lot of time worrying about stuff like that
7758766 we have to remember that whales are descended from a common ancestor of cows so this is not a surprise given what we know about whales
7758767 this is an incredibly neat use of google earth this is a study we would not have dreamed about doing five years ago

7758773 stack medias rapid ascent to number 10 reflects increasing fragmentation of the internet and a significant market shift in the consumption of content today

7758775 we may never know for certain who was responsible for these murders
7758776 but if the killer is ever identified it will probably be the result of a worldwide community of researchers sharing their knowledge with each other
7758777 im amazed that there arent more pictures of him available

7758782 since accounts payable typically represents a companys largest annual outlay it should be no surprise that it also represents one of the greatest areas of risk for fraud the good news is that companies today can use technology to shore up their internal controls and halt fraud in its tracks
7758783 with energy costs relatively inexpensive just a few years ago consumers werent all that concerned with the energy efficiency of their homes

7758792 the first year i dealt with a bit of homesickness and missing family and friends as anyone would when you change your job and your state
7758793 but from then on ive really built some momentum in my footy and also the way that ive handled things off the field so im very settled here in melbourne

7758929 however in the immediate future any downward correction in rents is unlikely
7758930 however the outer ring road micro market might see a slight correction in rental values due to the large number of developments scheduled for occupation in the near future
7758931 the widening of the flyover leading to whitefield and an elevated highway to electronics city will connect these micro markets thereby creating fresh demand in the above locations

7758937 if theres any crime at st genevieve i would be very surprised
7758938 what dan brought in was the idea that all of these kids are going to get a good education and go to college and that has a positive impact in this area of people respecting the school for many of the families their kids are the first ones to go to college and that gives them hope

7758945 i was sure hillary clinton would win she was my favorite i didnt think obama would get to first base
7758946 given the race issue i never did think america would get beyond that
7758947 what it does show is that america has gotten beyond the old race problems and the race issue
7758948 he happens to be a black man with charisma america likes young strong charismatic leaders someone who will come out riding the white horse and rescue them out of all the other candidates obama seems to be that one guy who represented so to speak the lone ranger

7758978 tranquillo cavaliere non intendo certo perdere tempo con la tua regina abbiamo tutti cose ben pi importanti da fare
7758979 non siete soli non tutti gli d i vi sono avversi
7758980 come sarebbe a dire non tutti pensavo che solamente in pochi ci avrebbero ostacolato
7758981 in molti non intendono riconoscere la minaccia di colui che chiamate loscuro e sono attaccati a ci che hanno adesso dimentichi di come erano un tempo ciechi di fronte a ci che noi tutti siamo ormai diventati ma non temete diversi di noi sono ancora in grado di vedere e di ricordare sappiamo che la vostra missione giusta e vi aiuteremo per quanto ci sar possibile
7758982 montate su questi unicorni vi porteranno in un luogo sicuro dal quale potrete arrivare indisturbati al regno delloscuro

7758996 twenty two years have passed and no one has forgotten the brutal and senseless murders of wendy offredo and dawn mccreery and no one has forgotten the name of richard cooey
7758997 not in 22 years have we seen that or believed that
7758998 the wounds have never been given the chance to close
7758999 it is inherently clear that richard cooey has taken no responsibility for his actions and shows no remorse for killing wendy and dawn
7759000 our family has never gotten an apology from richard cooey
7759001 weve gotten blatant lies and excuses is an apology too much to ask how could he commit such a heinous act and not feel regret
7759002 wendy offredo and dawn mccreery have been in their graves for 22 years and the families of these victims have waited 22 years for the sentence to be carried out
7759003 it is time to put an end to this case
7759004 you wouldnt know if it was his first or his 30th in a low scoring ballgame he set the tone thats what he does he does it from a spot in the order that can give us a lot of energy
7759005 were finding ways to win right now and thats what you want
7759006 i dont try to hit homers i try to just keep the ball in the gap and in the center of the field
7759007 ive been having some good games in the late innings
7759008 i tried to run it in on him but he got a good swing
7759009 it wasnt the best pitch to throw at that time
7759010 he was very good today and put us in a good position to win the ballgame
7759011 we got hits but didnt do much with it we didnt swing the bats well enough to score runs
7759012 we just want to win as many games as we can and finish as well as we can
7759013 coach stacey brings a wealth of knowledge and experience to the program along with stability considering hes been the varsity assistant for the past four years
7759014 we were faced with a very short time frame to find a replacement so going with an interim head coach for this year made the most sense
7759015 no it doesnt bother me brian koury explained to me what was behind it
7759016 he thought it best that we try to maintain as much stability as we could
7759017 you know michael was torn between coaching the kids or getting into the administration
7759018 as for my part going from assistant to head is a big undertaking but this is not my first time being a head coach
7759019 i will be trying to finish up something coach scott started ill be getting these kids to play as well as they possibly can but even more importantly ill be getting the kids ready to step out in the world
7759020 i have the utmost confidence that he will do a tremendous job
7759021 theres a new school board and a new superintendent theyre trying to do whats best for lorain theyre trying to make lorain a first class institution again i understand it and im willing to help and do whatever i can im just trying to do my small part
7759022 im going to stay a year and do what i can to help the situation
7759023 my biggest priority now is putting together a coaching staff we lost a few coaches you know
7759024 ill be trying to get them to buy into my program every day you have to get better
7759025 the no 1 thing is the kids ten 12 years down the road theyre going to have to be productive citizens
7759026 i presume bidens integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7759027 racial discrimination in employment has been made illegal but very little is being done at a tactical level a lot of it is ignorance
7759028 i presume bidens integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7759029 they say rest is the best thing guys are light sensitive from them you dont want him to have a whole lot of activity until he can get his bearings back
7759030 ill wait till next week before i make that consideration
7759031 especially after last week my biggest focus is on chicago trying to execute
7759032 i didnt really feel like i executed as well as i needed to and just didnt do enough to put more points on the board for us
7759033 overall it wasnt enough for us to jump up and down about but he has still got good ability and we still have confidence in his abilities
7759034 i know that he is going to work and try to make the most of this opportunity that is coming this week
7759035 im always confident in my ability someone once told me you have to have bad games to learn how to deal with the good ones
7759036 theres a lot i learned just from this past game and im taking it into this week and thats why i felt so much more confident out here today in practice
7759037 blessed are the meek for theirs is the kingdom of heaven
7759038 o show tem intersec o do trabalho de todos n s com eles diz marisa teresa cristina por exemplo canta uma m sica do candeia que ela gravou
7759039 marisa conseguiu resgatar alguns sambas que eram in ditos mas ainda tem muita coisa
7759040 dizem que n o existe velha guarda igual nossa porque s cantamos m sicas dos pr prios compositores da portela isso uma j ia rara e tamb m temos uma disciplina que mantemos at hoje
7759041 a nossa sorte que existem pessoas de um n vel de marisa monte que t m o cuidado de preservar essa coisa com respaldo muito grande
7759042 os ve culos de comunica o n o d o muita oportunidade para esse tipo de samba voc n o ouve tocando por a voc s encontra em algumas rodas de samba do sub rbio como a da tia doca
7759043 antigamente quando se falava em morro automaticamente associava com o samba hoje no rio tem outros movimentos ent o fica um pouco dividido
7759044 a ess ncia de cada um e tamb m as melodias lindas que s o uma fonte de realimenta o
7759045 isso rejuvenesce todo mundo acho que isso um dos mist rios do samba
7759046 um filme muito focado no valor humano na express o art stica desses sambistas na maneira de eles se relacionarem com a m sica com a arte tem v rios assuntos importantes como o samba entrou na vida deles quais eram suas primeiras refer ncias musicais como come aram a compor de onde vinha a inspira o para eles como eram as profiss es deles j que deixam claro que n o tinham a m sica como principal ocupa o a rela o com a escola o papel da mulher
7759047 ive been working here 12 years and knock wood ive never been stuck

7759051 does war aim for the more mature player and if so is this a viable business strategy
7759052 the group considers that the current difficult trading environment will continue for the foreseeable future with continued poor mortgage liquidity limiting housing market activity
7759053 a number of people have sustained injuries and both carriageways have been closed
7759054 the motorway is not expected to be reopened until noon due to damage caused to the central reservation and the need to remove heavy vehicles from the carriageways
7759055 if a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman both of them have done what is detestable they must be put to death their blood will be on their own heads
7759056 midview opened the game well when they put up that quick goal and they finished the game well when they put pressure on us there at the end
7759057 you have to give credit to a team thats down 4 1 late in the game and they come back and put pressure on you
7759058 i was happy to get off to a good start
7759059 my goal for the season was to break the scoring record for freshmen 11 goals i was happy but i had a lot of great passes from my teammates and i couldnt have done it without them
7759060 we went to a flat four this year when we had been doing a sweeper stopper before and i can see that coming together
7759061 we were a little sloppy with it earlier in the preseason but i think were finally executing it now
7759062 we have a good junior class under the seniors but we have a lot of freshmen and sophomores
7759063 so its been kind of a learning experience for the first month of the season hopefully well get things figured out pretty soon
7759064 wow i can get these guys to believe like i believe and then theyll come to my church and well take that mother over
7759065 whats that groups real motive whats in it for them
7759066 that is the essence of satanism putting yourself first each and every time
7759067 this is how i go when i go like this
7759068 i presume bidens integrity will lead him to refrain from presenting himself for communion if he supports a false right to abortion
7759069 i look over my shoulder and i see her i overhear a stranger and i hear her i walk down the street i feel her i feel alone and i need her i am waiting for you to return i wait for you to open the front door never to see never to speak to never to laugh with never to touch thats not something that i look forward to the effort of the struggle to live that you have made youre a strong woman in every way but if for some reason you decide to give up this time just know that ill stand beside you through every last breath

7759140 theres nothing to go back to she took my baby
7759141 your baby is 20 now her name is gwen shes a beautiful and delightful young woman
7759142 not exactly he looked for the baby for years and found her only after elissies death
7759143 shes a member of the guard and now acknowledged heir to the throne
7759144 no she doesnt she thinks youre dead they were all told you died in childbirth
7759145 they told me to go away and never come back
7759146 i refuse to be a burden i can take care of myself even here
7759147 im sure you can but wouldnt you rather do that in lakosha
7759148 the man honored by this monument what do you know about him
7759149 he was a great man in the history of america a president he wrote much of americas declaration of independence
7759150 did you know he was a bit of a rebel
7759151 it was a revolution one would assume they were all rebels
7759152 i meant socially they dont talk here about his personal life he had a long term relationship with one of his slaves that produced at least one child he was frequently in great debt but he was a visionary and in the end what society decided was important was not his violations of the social mores but his contributions to society
7759153 what have i to contribute im just the crazy homeless lady that lives at the jefferson memorial
7759154 well for one thing you contributed an heir to the throne albeit a reluctant one we havent had any living children
7759155 not very diplomatic there miss diplomatic liaison yes we had a stillborn son may i continue
7759156 just providing lakosha with continuity is more than ive been able to manage and youre still young who knows what more you have to offer before the goddess calls you home
7759157 that you werent in a relationship with each other other than that which fate forced you into there is no reason for you not to return is there
7759158 so you say but what do you know of the lakoshan rules not the law but the unwritten cultural requirements that insist a father marry the mother of his child
7759159 a bit tricky considering the father is in this case already very married
7759160 if the citizens demanded he step down unless he met that obligation he would
7759161 i can say with certainty that he wouldnt he would cede the throne to me as crown consort and should the citizenry object to that arrangement as well i would cede the throne to gwen despite her strong unwillingness to accept it
7759162 yet you knew him for less than a year and it was 20 years ago can you be so sure yourself
7759163 its an exaggeration to say i knew him at all i suppose other than the hero worship that most of the girls had for him it will make things awkward for him though
7759164 maybe so maybe not there wasnt as much talk as you might expect when gwen was announced to be his heir and what there was focused mainly on the rumor that she while delighted to have discovered she had a living father didnt want the job of heir thankyouverymuch
7759165 his parents are both dead the lord ascher passed on when he was 22 the lady mother leonore followed about 6 years later
7759166 after all we have been through in the last two plus years yes i am that certain of him
7759167 you are a lucky woman then to be able to say that
7759168 i am come home gwenfer meet your daughter if your folks arent dead make up with your folks either way you can move on with your life instead of living here where youre just that crazy lady that lives at the jeff
7759169 god only knows how many wandered from there to here
7759170 a woman you knew many years ago i found her at the jefferson memorial where elissie had stuffed her through the portal
7759171 fetch gwen malenn at once and the captain as well i believe they are both at the barracks
7759172 its rude to stare offer gwenfer a hand down please
7759173 they should be expecting you let me know if you need anything if youd ask whoevers on duty to get a room with a warm bath ready for gwenfer id appreciate it
7759174 i found someone while i was in dc who very much wants to meet you again
7759175 well shes not from dc shes from lakosha gwen elissie lied to everyone your mother didnt die in childbirth elissie put her through the portal
7759176 thats a hell of a lot to take in at 1 a m
7759177 you know what if i sit here and do that all summer i think id drive myself nuts until training camp
7759178 the best thing for me to do is take it day by day and focus on my training
7759179 but if i have to go back to the american league i just have to find a way to motivate myself to keep working hard and keep pushing i have come too far and have worked too hard that if it doesnt go my way this year it would be wrong to just not give the same effort
7759180 i talked to dale and he still wants me to be their guy
7759181 theyre not giving up on me just because that deal with huet happened thats something they had to do for me personally its just a mater of time now
7759182 if he wasnt talking to me i think it would be a totally different situation
7759183 him letting me know that they still want me that theyre still trying to find room for me it gives me a little bit of extra motivation
7759184 i really think hes a heck of a goalie we like his growth and the like the way he plays hes had a good couple of solid years in a row we have high hopes for him
7759185 i have been playing in the ahl for three pretty solid years
7759186 it was a lot of games down there i feel that im ready to move on and move up and get challenged up here
7759187 everybody wants to make the nhl at 20 and play forever but it doesnt always work out that way some guys have a longer road and you just have to keep plugging away and hope your opportunity comes earlier than later
7759188 we feel he can play some valuable minutes this year
7759189 i have to come into camp and prove to them that im ready

7759487 penyebabnya tidak lain negara negara industri maju seperti amerika serikat dan uni eropa tidak mau memenuhi ketentuan ketentuan wto soal pencabutan subsidi penghapusan hambatan pasar dan pengurangan dukungan domestik padahal ketentuan ketentuan tersebut merupakan komponen pokok yang disebut sebut sebagai prasyarat perdagangan bebas dunia
7759488 jauh sebelum wto berdiri sempat muncul international trade organization ito yang mengusung prinsip prinsip perdagangan bebas yang mirip dengan wto namun organisasi ini dibekukan ketika as menyadari bahwa dampak dari penerapan prinsip prinsip tersebut akan menyebabkan krisis overproduksi di as akan semakin buruk karena produk produk dari as tidak akan mampu bersaing dengan produk produk dari negara negara berkembang yang diolah dengan biaya produksi yang jauh lebih murah
7759489 logikanya tuntut dulu kepatuhan negara negara maju mengikuti prinsip prinsip wto baru ajukan beberapa proposal teknis seperti sp ssm
7759490 proposal sp ssm yang diajukan g33 melemahkan bargain dari negara negara berkembang yang tergabung dalam g20 yang menghendaki negara negara maju mengurangi dukungan domestik menghapus subsidi ekspor dan memperlebar akses pasar untuk komoditi dari negara negara berkembang sebelum melanjutkan perundingan pada aspek aspek teknis perdagangan bebas
7759491 namun diterimanya proposal g33 toh tidak memperbaiki iklim perundingan dalam wto terbukti juli 2006 perundingan wto mengalami kebuntuan berbagai upaya untuk mengatasi kebuntuan itu termasuk perundingan wto di geneva awal agustus 2008 lalu juga mengalami kebuntuan ini menunjukkan proposal sp ssm dari g33 kurang memberi pengaruh pada jalannya perundingan wto

7759607 adalah satu kemajuan bagi perempuan yang merenggangkan kedua pahanya kepada lelaki yang bukan suaminya setengahnya hingga mengeluarkan benih yang salah sifatnya aku goda semua manusia supaya meninggalkan sholat terbuai dengan makan minum berbuat durhaka aku lalaikan dengan harta benda daripada emas perak dan permata rumahnya tanahnya ladangnya supaya hasilnya dibelanjakan ke jalan haram demikian juga ketika pesta yang bercampur antara lelaki dan perempuan disana aku lepaskan sebesar besar godaan supaya hilang peraturan dan minum arak apabila terminum arak itu maka hilanglah akal fikiran dan malunya lalu aku ulurkan tali cinta dan terbukalah beberapa pintu maksiat yang besar datang perasaan hasad dengki hingga kepada pekerjaan zina apabila terjadi kasih antara mereka terpaksalah mereka mencari uang hingga menjadi penipu peminjam dan pencuri apabila mereka teringat akan salah mereka lalu hendak bertaubat atau berbuat amal ibadat aku akan rayu mereka supaya mereka menangguhkannya bertambah keras aku goda supaya menambahkan maksiat dan mengambil isteri orang bila kena goda hatinya datanglah rasa ria takabur megah sombong dan melengahkan amalnya bila pada lidahnya mereka akan gemar berdusta mencela dan mengumpat demikianlah aku goda mereka setiap saat
7759608 hai iblis mengapa engkau bersusah payah melakukan pekerjaan yang tidak mendatangkan faedah bahkan menambahkan laknat yang besar serta siksa yang besar di neraka yang paling bawah hai yang dikutuk allah siapa yang menjadikanmu siapa yang melanjutkan usiamu siapa yang menerangkan matamu siapa yang memberi pendengaranmu siapa yang memberi kekuatan anggota badanmu
7759609 semuanya itu adalah anugerah daripada allah yang maha besar juga tetapi hawa nafsu dan takabur membuatku menjadi jahat sebesar besarnya engkau lebih tahu bahwa diriku telah beribu ribu tahun menjadi ketua seluruh malaikat dan pangkatku telah dinaikkan dari satu langit ke satu langit yang tinggi kemudian aku tinggal di dunia ini beribadat bersama sekalian malaikat beberapa waktu lamanya tiba tiba datang firman allah swt hendak menjadikan seorang khalifah di dunia ini maka akupun membantah lalu allah menciptakan lelaki nabi adam lalu dititahkan seluruh malaikat memberi hormat kepada lelaki itu kecuali aku yang ingkar oleh karena itu allah murka kepadaku dan wajahku yang tampan rupawan dan bercahaya itu bertukar menjadi keji dan kelam aku merasa sakit hati kemudian allah menjadikan adam raja di syurga dan dikurniakan seorang permaisuri siti hawa yang memerintah seluruh bidadari aku bertambah dengki dan dendam kepada mereka akhirnya aku berhasil menipu mereka melalui siti hawa yang menyuruh adam memakan buah khuldi lalu keduanya diusir dari syurga ke dunia keduanya berpisah beberapa tahun dan kemudian dipertemukan allah di padang arafah hingga mereka mendapat beberapa orang anak kemudian kami hasut anak lelakinya qabil supaya membunuh saudaranya habil itu pun aku masih tidak puas hati dan berbagai tipu daya aku lakukan hingga hari kiamat sebelum engkau lahir ke dunia aku beserta bala tentaraku dengan mudah dapat naik ke langit untuk mencuri segala rahasia serta tulisan yang menyuruh manusia berbuat ibadat serta balasan pahala dan syurga mereka kemudian aku turun ke dunia dan memberitahu manusia yang lain aripada apa yang sebenarnya aku dapatkan dengan berbagai tipu daya hingga tersesat dengan berbagai kitab bidah dan carut marut tetapi ketika engkau lahir ke dunia ini maka aku tidak dibenarkan oleh allah untuk naik ke langit serta mencuri rahasia kerana banyak malaikat yang menjaga di setiap lapisan pintu langit jika aku berkeras juga hendak naik maka malaikat akan melontarkan anak panah dari api yang menyala sudah banyak bala tenteraku yang terkena lontaran malaikat itu dan semuanya terbakar menjadi abu maka besarlah kesusahanku dan bala tentaraku untuk menjalankan tugas menghasut
7759610 pertama sekali aku palingkan iktikad niatnya imannya kepada kafir juga ada dari segi perbuatan perkataan kelakuan atau hatinya jika tidak berhasil juga aku akan tarik dengan cara mengurangi pahala lama kelamaan mereka akan terjerumus mengikut kemauan jalanku
7759611 sebesar besarnya kesusahanku gementarlah badanku dan lemah tulang sendiku maka aku kerahkan berpuluh puluh iblis datang menggoda seorang manusia pada setiap anggota badannya setengah setengahnya datang pada setiap anggota badannya supaya malas sholat was was terlupa bilangan rakaatnya bimbang pada pekerjaan dunia yang ditinggalkannya sentiasa hendak cepat habis sholatnya hilang khusyuknya matanya sentiasa menjeling ke kiri kanan telinganya senantiasa mendengar orang bercakap serta bunyi bunyi yang lain setengah iblis duduk di belakang badan orang yang sembahyang itu supaya dia tidak kuasa sujud berlama lama penat atau duduk tahiyat dan dalam hatinya senantiasa hendak cepat habis sholatnya itu semua membawa kepada kurangnya pahala jika para iblis itu tidak dapat menggoda manusia itu maka aku sendiri akan menghukum mereka dengan seberat berat hukuman
7759612 jika mereka membaca al quran karena allah maka rasa terbakarlah tubuhku putus putus segala uratku lalu aku lari daripadanya
7759613 binasalah diriku gugurlah daging dan tulangku karena mereka telah mencukupkan rukun islamnya
7759614 ya rasulullah inilah bencana yang paling besar bahayanya kepadaku apabila masuk awal bulan ramadhan maka memancarlah cahaya arasy dan kursi bahkan seluruh malaikat menyambut dengan suka cita bagi orang yang berpuasa allah akan mengampunkan segala dosa yang lalu dan digantikan dengan pahala yang amat besar serta tidak dicatatkan dosanya selama dia berpuasa yang menghancurkan hatiku ialah segala isi langit dan bumi yakni malaikat bulan bintang burung dan ikan ikan semuanya siang malam mendoakan ampunan bagi orang yang berpuasa satu lagi kemuliaan orang berpuasa ialah dimerdekakan pada setiap masa dari azab neraka bahkan semua pintu neraka ditutup manakala semua pintu syurga dibuka seluas luasnya serta dihembuskan angin dari bawah arasy yang bernama angin syirah yang amat lembut ke dalam syurga pada hari umatmu mulai berpuasa dengan perintah allah datanglah sekalian malaikat dengan garangnya menangkapku dan tentaraku jin syaitan dan ifrit lalu dipasung kaki dan tangan dengan besi panas dan dirantai serta dimasukkan ke bawah bumi yang amat dalam di sana pula beberapa azab yang lain telah menunggu kami setelah habis umatmu berpuasa barulah aku dilepaskan dengan perintah agar tidak mengganggu umatmu umatmu sendiri telah merasa ketenangan berpuasa sebagaimana mereka bekerja dan bersahur seorang diri di tengah malam tanpa rasa takut dibandingkan bulan biasa
7759615 seluruh sahabatku adalah seperti bintang di langit jika kamu mengikuti mereka maka kamu akan mendapat petunjuk
7759616 jikalau adanya nabi sesudah aku maka umar boleh menggantikan aku
7759617 barang siapa menulis bismillahir rahmanir rahim pada kitab atau kertas kertas dengan dakwat merah nescaya mendapat pahala seperti pahala usman mati syahid
7759618 orang yang meringankan syariatmu dan membenci orang belajar agama islam
7759619 jika seorang islam pergi buang air besar serta tidak membaca doa pelindung syaitan maka aku gosok gosokkan najisnya sendiri ke badannya tanpa dia sadari
7759620 jika umatmu hendak bersetubuh dengan isterinya serta membaca doa pelindung syaitan maka larilah aku dari mereka jika tidak aku akan bersetubuh dahulu dengan isterinya dan bercampurlah benihku dengan benih isterinya jika menjadi anak maka anak itu akan gemar kepada pekerjaan maksiat malas pada kebaikan durhaka ini semua karena kealpaan ibu bapaknya sendiri begitu juga jika mereka makan tanpa membaca bismillah aku yang dahulu makan daripadanya walaupun mereka makan tiadalah merasa kenyang
7759621 jika dia berbuat dosa maka dia kembali bertaubat kepada allah menangis menyesal akan perbuatannya apabila marah segeralah mengambil air wudhu maka padamlah marahnya
7759622 orang yang tidur meniarap telungkup orang yang matanya terbuka mendusin di waktu subuh tetapi menyambung tidur lagi lalu aku lenakan dia hingga terbit fajar demikian jua pada waktu zuhur asar maghrib dan isya aku beratkan hatinya untuk sholat

7759626 in america i will have a daughter just like me but over there nobody will say her worth is measured by the loudness of her husbands belch over there nobody will look down on her because i will make her speak only perfect american english and over there she will always be too full to swallow any sorrow she will know my meaning because i will give her this swan a creature that became more than what was hoped for
7759627 this feather may look worthless but it comes from afar and carries with it all my good intentions
7759628 you are running an invalid copy of windows xp please rectify this situation
7759629 i am compelled by the insensitivity which the dead ends of wtf official channels have offered to plead for justice and my fears about the deleterious effect of such deadness on the future of our taekwondo sport to make this protest to you
7759630 the object of this petition is the poor officiating in the mens over 80kg quarter final tournament between nigeria chika chukwumerije and greece alexandro nicholaidias on august 23 in 2008 olympic games in beijing beijing science and technology university gymnasium
7759631 my locus standi what you may ask is my rightful interest in this matter i am a member of the taekwondo family a senior black belt a promoter of taekwondo in nigeria and the father of the short changed player in this disputed contest chika chukwumerije
7759632 in the second round of the contest alexandro held chika by his chest protector and attempted an ass kick on the head apparently in a desperate bid to wipe off chikas two point lead holding an opponent while kicking is a punishable offence by taekwondo rules the referees overlooked the infraction no point was deducted from alexandro
7759633 the attempted ass kick by alexandro totally missed chika who successfully ducked but the referees inexplicably awarded two marks to alexandro and he levelled up with chikas two point lead
7759634 we were told that the protest would be considered and a review was under way the next shock which hit us was a display on the television screen announcing a tournament for a third position and listing chika chukwumerije as a contestant this meant that our protest received merely a nominal nod but was never treated unlike the protest by britain in an earlier bout
7759635 from this account the following observations are noteworthy first by fair officiating this tournament should have ended 3 0 in favour of chika chukwumerije
7759636 on three occasions the referees stopped the fight and consulted among themselves thereby giving a strong impression that they were unsure of their readings of the contest please compare the stoppages in this fight with referee interventions in all the other taekwondo fights in this olympic games
7759637 the international image of taekwondo may be soiled and its standing in the comity of world sports lowered by a growing impression of subjective and unpredictable commitment of our referees to the rules of the game
7759638 the insensitivity of the taekwondo supervisory board to genuine protests against provable acts of poor officiating in accordance with the rules encourages anti compliance behaviour among practitioners compare the responses of the supervisory board to two protests britains and nigerias in an earlier bout womens under 57kg quarter finals the british coach angrily shot up from his seat like thunder bolt and protested in a loud voice against a case of poor officiating he aggressively followed up after the contest with a strong protest to the board the supervisory board reviewed the case played back the tape in full view of the audience and reversed the verdict of the judges in nigerias case the nigerian coach quietly waited like a law abiding practitioner till the end of the bout to make his protest nigeria avoided violence of fist or body language the supervisory board ignored our appeal and the review of the disputed contest did not take place we gathered from the grapevine that the supervisory council was afraid that a second reversal of an unjustified verdict would be one too many and could deal embarrassing damage to the image of world taekwondo federation
7759639 if youre catholic and you disagree with your church what do you do you change your mind
7759640 unfortunately what transpired has left us feeling bewildered disappointed and quite frankly feeling disrespected

7759649 now run through the sprinklers and dont tell anyone about this teri this is our secret this is our game now if you tell anyone then i will have to play this game with dara do you understand

7759651 bryan has been around a number of years now and he has been a good defenceman for quite some time
7759652 im excited about bryans willingness to come here on a tryout it will certainly pick up the competition level of what is going to take place in training camp
7759653 i thank the flyers for giving me this opportunity to try out
7759654 i am really looking forward to this i have been around for a while and training camps are nothing new for me i like to come in and compete at a high level
7759655 most people like a fixed or torpedo back where the back twists chains are normally of the handmade variety and are harder to put on whereas the static backs are less fiddly

7759658 russia is clearly irritated at what it perceives as us meddling in its neighborhood it seems to be sending a message that if you play on our periphery we will play in yours
7759659 no one can dictate to poland what it should do
7759660 this agreement makes the sec the most widely distributed conference in the country
7759661 the bottom line here is that fans of sec football will have more access to games and better distribution than they ever have in the past
7759662 its not hard to figure why wed want to be involved with it given the quality of sec sports for 15 more years
7759663 one of the reasons that this league has developed into one of the top leagues in the country is because we have tremendous exposure
7759664 i think we had the best exposure from a tv standpoint in our last contract and this one is only going to enhance it more
7759665 what do we care if we were expelled from college scarlett the war is going to start any day now so wed have left college anyhow

7759669 the biggest problem that referees have had with bad behavior has been at the youth level
7759670 you have an intersection of the least skilled players and least skilled parents and the least skilled referees by and large things are pretty good but there is this overarching problem
7759671 i had a chance to talk to the umpire and my heart broke for the guy because he felt so badly
7759672 he spent the rest of his time here apologizing to anyone who would listen
7759673 i think this makes it too much of a professional sports atmosphere
7759674 little league is meant to be fun nobody wants a bad call but to introduce instant replay makes it too much high stakes
7759675 as a society we are getting away from the fact that sports are meant to be fun for the kids they are not meant to be competitive for the parents a lot of kids and parents and coaches are trying to make it into professional sports we have gotten so aggressive with sports that weve lost sight of what it is to some degree
7759676 a coach who has a 12 year old who can throw 80 miles an hour is going to have ear plugs in his ears even if the kid is sore

7759678 you must not intermarry with them because they will surely turn your hearts after their gods
7759679 since this is your attitude and you have not kept my covenant and my decrees which i commanded you i will most certainly tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your subordinates 12 nevertheless for the sake of david your father i will not do it during your lifetime i will tear it out of the hand of your son 13 yet i will not tear the whole kingdom from him but will give him one tribe for the sake of david my servant and for the sake of jerusalem which i have chosen
7759680 let me go that i may return to my own country
7759681 what have you lacked here that you want to go back to your own country
7759682 take ten pieces for yourself for this is what the
7759683 but i will not take the whole kingdom out of solomons hand i have made him ruler all the days of his life for the sake of david my servant whom i chose and who observed my commands and statutes
7759684 your father put a heavy yoke on us but now lighten the harsh labor and the heavy yoke he put on us and we will serve you
7759685 go away for three days and then come back to me
7759686 if today you will be a servant to these people and serve them and give them a favorable answer they will always be your servants
7759687 what is your advice how should we answer these people who say to me lighten the yoke your father put on us
7759688 tell these people who have said to you your father put a heavy yoke on us but make our yoke lighter tell them my little finger is thicker than my fathers waist
7759689 my father made your yoke heavy i will make it even heavier my father scourged you with whips i will scourge you with scorpions
7759690 what share do we have in david what part in jesses son to your tents o israel look after your own house o david
7759691 say to rehoboam son of solomon king of judah to the whole house of judah and benjamin and to the rest of the people
7759692 the kingdom will now likely revert to the house of david 27 if these people go up to offer sacrifices at the temple of the in jerusalem they will again give their allegiance to their lord rehoboam king of judah they will kill me and return to king rehoboam
7759693 it is too much for you to go up to jerusalem here are your gods o israel who brought you up out of egypt
7759694 of course we cannot regulate in this regard but can point the finger we can ask awkward questions and we can put some pressure on and i believe politicians and others should do so
7759695 as if in deep contemplation perfectly fitting of an emperor who was more of a philosopher than a soldier
7759696 i walked away and said good night and walked over across the hall to the elevators
7759697 and i came back over and said excuse me what did you just say and he grabbed me by my arms and started laughing and i said no no what did you just say and he didnt repeat it and i said did you call me an uncle tom and then i came back with a barrage of things that i wont repeat publicly
7759698 supporting hillary clinton is not a litmus test for being black
7759699 last night i was called an uncle tom by emil jones in the lobby of the hotel right in front of ald freddrenna lyle and ald leslie hairston and ald latasha thomas
7759700 i walked over to him and asked him what did you just call me
7759701 i like running because its a challenge if you run hard theres the pain and youve got to work your way through the pain you know lately it seems all you hear is dont overdo it and dont push yourself well i think thats a lot of bull if you push the human body it will respond

7759703 there are people who are not going to vote for him because hes black
7759704 and weve got to hope that we can educate people to put aside their racism and to put their own interests no 1
7759705 the work begins anew the hope rises again and the dream lives on
7759706 that you work hard for what you want in life that your word is your bond and you do what you say youre going to do that you treat people with dignity and respect even if you dont know them and even if you dont agree with them
7759707 there can be no treaty or agreement except on the basis of iraqs full sovereignty
7759708 we have a feeling that they have split up and went different ways from finding some of the jumpsuits throughout the city
7759709 we were all extremely impressed with not only the amount of entries we received but their level of quality as well the finalists this year delivered some of the best creative talent we have seen
7759710 its fairly obvious that its not the smart thing to do
7759711 its like watching television or reading the newspaper when youre driving is a bad idea
7759712 if theres a potential to help reaction times i dont think its too much to ask someone to use a headset instead
7759713 if we saw statistics or studies that show that theres a reduction in accidents if we use headsets then i could see making this a law
7759714 if i talk on my cell phone i do pay less attention to driving
7759715 if youre holding a cell phone and you drop it its definitely more dangerous if i have both hands on the wheel i have more control of the car

7759840 there is nothing of the kind in the resolution when we say that they must pay serious attention to the question we do so just because the ods statutes do not allow the executive council the chairman or the head of the deputies group to decide on the personnel questions of individual local party organisations
7759841 the ods executive council disagrees on principle with the repeated voting by several deputies elected for the ods against their own group and against the odss fundamental programme priorities along with the communists kscm and the social democrats cssd
7759842 in making out the lists of candidates emphasis is placed on other priorities than the real demand of society for a greater representation of women in politics
7759843 on the other hand current politics is not such as to attract women
7759844 there should be more women on the lists of candidates unfortunately this has only been a recommendation as yet
7759845 politics is considered to a great extent as a world of men meetings continue long into the night and at the weekends which is a problem for women who take care of their families
7759846 it we take a long time setting the date we lay ourselves open to risks and uncertainties that are not desirable for us
7759847 it is a bit courageous but i think the step will pay off
7759848 if romanies in slezska ostrava want to live better we will help them find better jobs if they are unable to do the job we will ensure re training courses for them we want the problematic localities to stop functioning as ghettos that have so far lived their own life
7759849 their residents have launched a petition they are afraid of being dumped to the street but the authorities do not allow this
7759850 it would see to it that romany children attend school and out school activities a new centre is to be build near riegrova street that children and adults will use i hope the agency will help change these peoples lives to the better
7759851 in the na liscine street drugs have appeared and in nova osada in kuncicky there are problems in relations between people residents there have even threatened to establish a vigilante group

7759859 i really dont have time to play the game where i push you around until you decide to tell me that you work for mr monroe we both know just like we both know he is the dirtiest mayor the city has seen in a while
7759860 so what if i do i didnt realize that was a crime
7759861 but it is when you have been hired to attack the families who those who dont want to be on the payroll care to tell me why
7759862 and i dont know if i can hold on to your jacket any longer
7759863 i swear i swear he gives me orders tells me where to go if i ask why he says nothing

7759870 geeze can you turn off the lawyering for one minute and just pretend you are human how are you feeling
7759871 i said i was fine why do you always need me to write a book about how i feel all the time
7759872 why do you have to be so guarded all the time this is what i do for a living why wont you let me help you
7759873 you think that because you counsel a few kids at the local shelter that you qualify to help every one
7759874 you seemed to think i was pretty qualified when you were defending one of my kids a few months ago when we met
7759875 lets just drop this i said that i was fine case
7759876 did i as for it god case not every one is in touch with themselves as you would like them to be not every one wants to talk about how they are feeling all the time not every one needs saving
7759877 call me if there is any change there is some where i have to be anyway
7759878 the uohs therefore made a thorough analysis of local markets the results show that the concerned merger would lead to high concentration on local retail markets in four districts
7759879 in 2000 czech spa hotels registered only 437 000 guests compared with 650 000 last year
7759880 russians consider the czech republic a number one spa superpower and a visit to karlovy vary or marianske lazne is a question of prestige for them
7759881 arabs come to spas mainly for treatment of their illnesses and spend long weeks and months in the czech republic germans appreciate a good quality price ratio
