3890017 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but
3890018 w hat the obama attack addoes not say is that much of mccains celebrity over the last decade or so is attributedto a liberal media love affair fond of mccain because he so often breaks withthe gop
3890019 economics by john mccain support george bush 95 percent of the time keep spending 10 billion dollars a month for the war in iraq while the iraqis sell oil for record prices giving iraq a 79 billion oil surplus and hurting our economy
3890020 barack obamas plan end the war responsibly better schools no more tax breaks for oil companies barack obama the middle class first
3890021 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3890022 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
3890023 in this case it was determined that we needed to move forward in a timely fashion
3890024 too many americans have lost sight of the optimism and ingenuity that made our country great
3890025 its almost like weve given up hope of a bright future for our nation and that perception is far sadder than the actual hardships we face history suggests that americans can do anything we set our minds to and its time we remembered that fact
3890026 we must invest first and foremost in our education system for all kids whether they are rich or poor black brown or white
3890027 school must be more than a place kids go to learn how to read and write multiply and divide its where they must develop special skills that prepare them for successful careers in an increasingly competitive global marketplace and its where they must develop basic life skills such as honesty perseverance self discipline and respect by making sure that our young people get what they really need to be productive and successful members of society well be tackling our problems where they begin
3890028 i think what weve been able to do at university academy could be done on a larger scale throughout the country
3890029 the american dream is alive and well i see it every day with the kids i teach we need only to re harness and refocus some of the ingenuity that made our country special so that more citizens can achieve their dreams and that starts with improving the way we educate all of our children
3890030 like any service business quality is dependent on the caliber of individuals who are providing the service
3890031 we must recognize that compared to countries in which student academic achievement is higher than in the u s our teachers are undervalued and under appreciated particularly in the urban core this is significant because after all teaching is the most important profession in the country
3890032 its no secret that many of our nations urban schools have lower standards
3890033 and out of a sense of pity too many kids who havent demonstrated academic proficiency are passed along from one grade to the next pity is a dangerous trap for an urban teacher who is tempted to feel sorry for the stereotypical poor disadvantaged kid who might be viewed as having no future no one helps kids by feeling sorry for them it tells them only that their teachers expect them to fail and creates a self fulfilling prophecy
3890034 just as medical students spend a significant amount of time training in hospitals education students should spend more time in a variety of actual classrooms observing assisting and teaching
3890035 this is particularly true for aspiring urban teachers who will face unique challenges when they start their careers education schools must also recruit much more aggressively the best and brightest high school graduates to become future teachers
3890036 schools must teach caring compassion respect and responsibility to help offset the corrosive aspects of our larger culture
3890037 after all who other than parents and religious institutions is better positioned to teach these things character education and academics go hand in hand i have discovered that there are fewer disruptions in the classroom when there is a strong emphasis on character development
3890038 we simply cant afford to have math and science programs that are sub par
3890039 in a world in which technology is changing at unprecedented rates an emphasis on math and science content coupled with teachers in all schools who are qualified to teach these subjects will help ensure our nations ability to compete in the 21st century
3890040 traditionally teacher salaries have been based largely on education and experience levels
3890041 this is in my opinion inadequate and unjust experience and education are certainly important but performance matters the most i think schools should move toward performance based compensation pay for performance is commonplace in business and it should be standard practice in the business of education it motivates workers to accomplish specific goals and it rewards top achievers why should public educators be exempt from the same opportunities that other professional managers are afforded they shouldnt
3890042 no question about it raising kids is intense and often exhausting
3890043 but to not get deeply involved in their education is to neglect a critical aspect of parenting
3890044 the growing sentiment that our societys problems are too big for any of us to conquer affects us and not just the problems themselves believe me ive seen students who once viewed themselves as having no future graduate from high school with distinction then go on to college and truly make something of themselves we all have that fighting spirit its our national birthright never ever bet against the american dream it has never let us down before and i dont believe it will fail us now
3890045 the debian package has been created in the current directory you can install the package as root e g dpkg i sun j2re1 6 1 6 0 update7 i386 deb
3890046 after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soliders traveling to war zones the choice for us to forego payment for a third check bag from the department of defense was clear
3890047 i think the scalability of some of these u s brands into international markets has been a big factor
3890048 specifically if you look at facebook and hi5 what theyre doing in terms of foreign language interface translation and their emphasis on cultural relevance in each of the markets theyre expanding to has helped them grow pretty dramatically across all global regions
3890049 translation opens the door and all the other things follow
3890050 they didnt offer translations until this year facebook was behind the curve not as localized as myspace or hi5
3890051 they were doing very well in the english speaking world but not until providing localized content could they tap into that growth
3890052 we have a member translation tool that allows users to translate different words it helps with colloquialisms and slang and different spellings of words and those get captured and flagged by users and then the community votes on the accuracy
3890053 even though many are u s based in terms of overall usage the u s market is a pretty mature market
3890054 its not going to sustain the level of growth its seen over the past few years but its definitely an audience to grow if you emphasize these global regions
3890055 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3890056 it is higher than the last couple of months but by no means unprecedented february this year also saw six critical and five important updates
3890057 there are 500 plus vulnerabilities reported every month not all of these are windows related of course many of these are related to less prevalent systems but microsoft products still account for a large number of these vulnerabilities
3890058 only critical and important vulnerabilities were addressed in this update i am sure there were less severe vulnerabilities reported or found but it seems that microsoft has had to focus on only the most severe triage style it is important to patch these first however i should point out that most attacks are based on a combination of less dangerous vulnerabilities
3890059 critical patches address issues that can lead to malicious code being run directly on the victims computer the most serious form of attack
3890060 enterprises should apply the patches as soon as possible particularly the internet explorer patch because it addresses a vulnerability that has been publicly disclosed and affects the software that is most likely to encounter malicious attacks internet browsing is by far the most effective common way in which the average use will encounter malicious code

3890099 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time

3890181 theres frustration inside and outside ua that in an economy where its so difficult to come by money whats there is just not being spent do the ua people even know how to develop in an appropriate or effective manner
3890182 paula calls it a day or the company implodes on its own or a gun is put to wagners head by financiers and she greenlights things and then trusts in luck
3890183 paula wasnt greenlighting movies so she was about to lose a lot of the money her camp is trying to say mgm screwed up we didnt she did now mgm can get ua moving on at least 2 movies and make sure theyre released by a certain date to keep the financing intact

3890197 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3890198 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3890199 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart
3890200 there doesnt have to be an environmental catastrophe for air pollution to cause injury
3890201 were talking about very modest increases air pollution can be dangerous at levels that are within the accepted air quality standards
3890202 patients with cardiovascular disease shouldnt exercise outside on days with increased air pollution levels on very polluted days they should consider staying inside and during the winter they should limit exposure to fireplace smoke
3890203 of course the real solution is to reduce air pollution
3890204 the review by dr simkhovich and his fellow authors make it quite clear that air pollution is linked to cardiovascular disease
3890205 they suggest that this is another compelling reason to campaign for improved air quality while at the same time studying therapies to minimize the risk of exposures

3890219 the first pictures from yesterdays flyby of enceladus are now public at closest approach cassini was set spinning to cancel out the apparent motion of enceladus so as to capture unsmeared images during the 40 000 mph flyby although it wasnt clear that this would work errors in pointing could easily have made the cameras miss their targets the maneuver panned out beautifully producing spectacular images of the surface images show the tiger stripes at the south pole including at least one location that has been identified as a source of a jet as well as considerable vertical relief easily visible thanks to the low sun angle near the south pole at present processed enhanced images should follow shortly

3890223 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3890224 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3890225 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3890226 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
3890227 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement
3890228 could this be one of the solitary times kristol has ever been right

3890245 stopped using marijuana and cocaine completely in college or whether his drug usage extended to his law school days or beyond
3890246 i havent done anything since i was 20 years old
3890247 self reporting by people who have used drugs as to when they stopped is inherently unreliable
3890248 i turned around and there was elvis i thought i was going to have a heart attack
3890249 the chemistry between us was if we both hadnt of been married i tell you the chemistry was unbelievable
3890250 you had to see this man in person the skin the nose the profile the eyes he was just beautiful
3890251 he was very down to earth the fabulous thing about elvis was that he was more interested in you than trying to be interesting himself
3890252 born in china he entered the united states legally on a tourist visa
3890253 after almost two weeks of suffering with unbearable back pain and unable to get any sleep he was so weak and looked horrible
3890254 he said i told the nursing department im in pain but they dont believe me
3890255 because he could no longer withstand the suffering inside the facility

3890257 i am excited about this chance to showcase some of the initiatives we launched here in virginia and the results we achieved in our effort to help people compete in a changing economy
3890258 by working cooperatively with republicans democrats and independents we restored integrity to virginias budget process and focused on bringing jobs to the hardest hit regions in the commonwealth im pleased we will have a chance to share the virginia success story at the convention in denver
3890259 we really didnt get any data that made us feel any better about the financials
3890260 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3890261 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3890262 really special and sorry to tell you probably more expensive
3890263 i suspect that theres a whole lot of clicking without a lot of thinking
3890264 so much of this sharing happens in a way that users dont see the consequences its kind of a big black hole
3890265 people seem to have this idea that when you put something on the internet there should be some privacy model out there that theres somebody out there thats enforcing good manners but thats not true
3890266 self policing schemes are not enough to protect consumers privacy and offer no enforcement against improper behavior
3890267 while companies like google are trying to put pretty good practices in place we dont want to rely on the good graces of the companies because they might change their minds
3890268 we have consumers and the ftc and industry agreeing on consumer choice and then no way to technically get there
3890269 i think the way to do it isnt a government place where your browser goes and gets stuff
3890270 the rule should be that whatever technology platform youre using should have no brainer easy to use labels that people know how to toggle to turn on or off the kinds of personalization storing whatever it is that that particular platform does
3890271 on business to protect and safeguard consumers to whom they are providing these products
3890272 the system is already in place its too late to turn it back

3890278 each year as many as 50 infants are placed on the waiting list for cardiac transplantation but die while waiting owing to the lack of a suitable donor heart
3890279 adding an additional two three or five minutes or even 75 seconds does add some additional injury it could be 10 percent
3890280 the 6 month survival rate was 100 percent for the 3 transplant recipients and 84 percent for 17 control infants who received transplants procured through standard organ donation
3890281 as a result of their investigational protocol three babies are now alive had the procedures not been performed it is virtually certain that all six babies would be dead
3890282 removing organs from a patient whose heart not only can be restarted but also has been or will be restarted in another body is ending a life by organ removal
3890283 i have to say that the reports are not encouraging about russias respect for the ceasefire for the pledge that it undertook
3890284 that will only serve to deepen the isolation into which russia is moving
3890285 there are concerning reports from around georgia that it has not in fact in accordance with the pledge that it took to the french presidency to president sarkozy that russia has not ended its military operations
3890286 the president of the republic held a lengthy telephone conversation with russian president dmitry medvedev early this evening

3890298 i debated whether or not to do an opening statement simply because i dont want to get into an argument with the government about what happened
3890299 fair and accurate up to the point of what occurred at the campground which is really the only part that i havent been interviewed by the police about
3890300 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think

3890337 ive been fortunate enough to continue to play at a high enough level that ive been able to stay in one of the best leagues in the world playing against the best players

3890341 yeah its been nine months and ive never seen jaliek personally but the photographs ive seen the features arent there

3890345 as we have seen with other sporting events that run during traditional working hours for example the ncaa basketball tournament fans are making time at the office for the olympics
3890346 while the olympics were until very recently a packaged prime time tv event they now represent a 24 7 opportunity for both fans and the media the available inventory online provides a really interesting platform for the olympics long tail events and sports previously represented perhaps only in the results section of the morning paper can now be viewed by fans around the world well know soon enough if the online audience maintains interest for the duration of the games
3890347 i feel bad for the poor horse hes probably going to die soon anyway
3890348 as long as hes being taken care of they should leave him alone
3890349 i would prefer to have him remain as stable as he is and be able to enjoy his life i like to go out and pet him its just a matter of feeding and petting him i would be totally lost at the point where he disappears from the scene
3890350 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3890351 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3890352 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3890353 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the u k and the international community
3890354 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
3890355 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
3890356 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper

3890359 the police party was deployed in front of the police station and a suicide bomber approached them on foot and exploded himself resulting in seven deaths so far
3890360 it was an act to sabotage the independence day celebrations

3890362 there were three to four other policemen standing nearby with their uniforms torn
3890363 we have dealt with all the elements on which president mugabe and mutambara agree but there is disagreement on one element over which morgan tsvangirai had asked for time to reflect
3890364 we have adjourned to give morgan tsvangirai more time to consider these matters
3890365 on our side as a party we have no problems on that aspect
3890366 committed to reaching an agreement that upholds the will of the people
3890367 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country
3890368 we are committed to a solution that recognises that the people spoke on the 29th of march 2008
3890369 the purpose is to figure out how memories are actually stored in a biological brain
3890370 if we can understand some of the basics of what is going on in our little model brain it could have enormous medical spinoffs
3890371 within about 24 hours they start sending out feelers to each other and making connections
3890372 within a week we get some spontaneous firings and brain like activity
3890373 now we are looking at how best to teach it to behave in certain ways
3890374 this one is a bit boisterous and active while we know another is not going to do what we want it to
3890375 this is a simplified version of what goes on in the human brain where we can look and control the basic features in the way that we want in a human brain you cant really do that
3890376 the project gives us a unique opportunity to look at something which may exhibit complex behaviours but still remain closely tied to the activity of individual neurons
3890377 i thank the shareholders and plan to immediately act to protect the interests of the company with the help of a new team of persons to direct all legal financial and business aspects of the company mse embodies in its core business the most exciting potential i have ever been involved in and we will move immediately to fully exploit that opportunity to build shareholder value and to become a fully reporting company with ultimately its shares trading on the bulletin board or higher as soon as legally permitted as well we will institute new investors relations policies that will ensure that the companys valued shareholders are kept abreast of corporate developments in a timely manner
3890378 i have been bombarded with shareholder concerns about the company and now am bombarded with well wishes as we adopt a new outlook to be planned and executed on an international level building relationships with wall street focusing on a major acquisition target i have contemplated bringing in regulatory affairs advisors from washington d c with international political relationships is just the start of a plan a plan that will push to have mse become a reporting company and our stock trading on the bulletin board as quickly as possible
3890379 mse enviro tech corp will be guided and developed to be a company that communicates with its shareholders regularly maintains a serious corporate presence in the international business community fosters awareness within the financial community and studies and acts prudently on licensing acquisitions and other well advised diversification of our model
3890380 we wish to take this opportunity to express our sincere appreciation to our valued shareholders for their continued patience support and belief in the companys future we believe that the future is brighter today than it has ever been and look forward to reporting on our progress in all respects in the weeks and months ahead

3890383 this is a very good deal for marifil and i believe speaks volumes as to the potential size and profitability of this large deposit we have analyzed four wells and since these wells were sited to test deeper oil targets they are essentially random with respect to testing the shallower potash deposit this probably means that we have not seen the axis of the potash basin where the thicker and richer parts of the deposit occur

3890392 i will be offering plans to tackle issues of the day like improving public transportation and home heating
3890393 teddy has had years to address them and i still believe that his failure to do so is a very appropriate topic of this campaign to me thats still campaigning on the issues
3890394 home storage of antibiotics involves risks that you should consider very seriously
3890395 the board isnt saying this should never be done but we are saying you need to sit down and understand all the ramifications before you go any further
3890396 could reduce your need to depend upon public health agencies as they try to get antibiotics to everyone at risk during an anthrax emergency
3890397 we urge you not to move precipitously to promote home stockpiling before the scientific questions can be answered
3890398 there is a high risk of providing a confusing message that does not have the endorsement of experts in public health biodefense and infectious disease nor of the majority of medical practitioners
3890399 accepts that nature has this ability we should try to create models that explain it
3890400 it could be correlated with how much they like men generally

3890409 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3890410 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama

3890420 they had four major and respected law firms advising them as well as lazard
3890421 and all of them all of them were advising the board that there was zero value in a bankruptcy for shareholders as well as losses to creditors
3890422 and had they not been in a position where jpmorgan was in effect in control they could have said to jpmorgan we like that first agreement we know the price is inadequate but we expect that someone is going to come along another bank and there were other banks out there that given sufficient time could have come in and acquired them for closer to fair value
3890423 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
3890424 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
3890425 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation

3890443 the damage is significant especially in the city centre and many houses hit were obviously not military targets houses shops and the hospital but i would not describe it as a city razed to the ground
3890444 we have serious doubts about the numbers provided by the russian authorities so far the number of wounded and killed just do not support each other because the number of wounded is usually far larger than those killed
3890445 at this point where the conflict is winding down it is extremely irresponsible of the authorities to give these figures without evidence to support it
3890446 we are very clear that some of the weapons fired by the georgians are unacceptable under international law
3890447 the use of the grad rocket launcher in urban areas is indiscriminate by nature and a breach of human rights law several rooms of the hospital were hit by grads
3890448 according to doctors the hospital was under serious fire and subject to further investigation the rockets appear to have come from the georgian side it probably amounts to a persecution of civilians
3890449 we saw looting with our own eyes they were taking household items loading electric heaters bicycles and carpets
3890450 in response to our pleas it looks like the russian military is trying to prevent looting today they closed the road to the south ossetian military
3890451 why women cant sniff out mr right when they take the pill and how it affects us all
3890452 there would be little joy for either john mccain or barack obama if they were to mistakenly trade ipods
3890453 why women cant sniff out mr right when they take the pill and how it affects us all
3890454 it was an experiment that involved sweat love and could have ended in tears when 100 women were asked to sniff 100 mens sweaty shirts in the interests of discovering the secrets of sexual attraction they found the contraceptive pill disrupted their ability to select the ideal partner body odour plays an important part in mate selection but the pill appears to interfere with a womans sense of smell undermining her capacity to make the best choice researchers said if confirmed the finding suggests that by disturbing a womans natural olfactory preferences the contraceptive pill could be to blame for fertility problems relationship dissatisfaction and marital breakdown it could even lead to problems in the next generation resulting in children with weaker immune systems opposites attract in gender and in genes but the study revealed that instead of going for genetically dissimilar mates as human beings are instinctively inclined to do women on the pill tended to select men more genetically similar to themselves this is evolutionary suicide because the survival of the species depends on genetic diversity

3890458 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3890459 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3890460 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth
3890461 approximately half of women in the united states will face an unintended pregnancy during their lifetime and about half of those who unintentionally become pregnant resolve the pregnancy through abortion
3890462 the reasons that women most frequently cite for terminating a pregnancy include not being ready to care for a child or another child at that time financial inability to care for a child concern for or responsibility to others desire to avoid single parenthood relationship problems and feeling too young or immature to raise a child
3890463 some pregnancies are terminated because they are a consequence of rape or incest very few fewer than 1 percent women cite coercion from others as a major reason for their abortion

3890474 the recommendation by the supreme court of india to find alternative alignment in the proceedings related to the sethusamudram ship channel project and order to set up an expert committee to consider this alternate project is a defeat of dravida munnetra kazagam led by karunanidhi and his supporters including sonia gandhi it is thus an indication of the fact that the hindu revival is on hand
3890475 you should seek the counsel of hindu acharya sabha which is spearheading the cause of hindu unity to ensure that democracy secularism and harmony will continue to flourish in our country in order to meet these objectives however
3890476 you were told in our history books and by our intellectual community nurtured with the pseudo secular studies and twisted history written by british imperialists and their cronies that india was invaded hindus were beaten and vanquished but the truth is otherwise

3890481 a vigilant supervisor prevented the payment of the bill and alerted our internal fraud unit they in turn contacted the land bank
3890482 during the month of october 2007 the security door leading to the treasury dealing room was malfunctioning
3890483 the urgency of the matter was communicated but still it took a couple of weeks for the door to be fixed during that period anyone had free access to the treasury
3890484 during the past couple of weeks several valuable personal items were stolen from locked cupboards in the treasury dealing room
3890485 the thefts were reported but to date no action had been taken to investigate the matter
3890486 upon closer inspection it was noted that the two authorising signatures had been forged all blank money market instruments were checked immediately and it was found that three land bank bills and 25 land bank promissory notes were missing from the locked safe in the treasury
3890487 report this theft to the saps without delay and that all security means available be checked to determine who had access to the treasury dealing room especially after hours
3890488 took steps and put in place procedures for the issuing of financial instruments which govern the overall process including an effective monitoring system where participants sign off at every stage in issuing of financial instruments a daily record of log books is also kept
3890489 the bank didnt suffer any financial loss and dealt with the matter almost immediately telling clearing banks not to honour any of the instruments
3890490 the public were never notified these things are legal tender so if someone bought cows from a farmer and gave him one of these promissory notes the guy would only find out it had been stopped when he went to the bank by then it is too late the cows are gone somebody will suffer losses

3890492 the self dominated submissive female becomes very stressed when in the presence of an genetically dominant male she feels compelled and attracted on a primal or instinctive subliminal level this can sometimes result in aberrant or even violent behavior
3890493 an alpha female is hyper sensitive to many things dominant energy command structures voice directed inflection and other things are coupled to her intense need or desire to express her submission she is susceptible in a whole new way she is not aware that the dominant traits of a true alpha male are quite easily expressed and carried through the written word she may have learned cognitive skills and patterned her emotional reactions through extensive reading but she is now vulnerable to something that was her protection reading was never interactive before and what was once part of her defenses may become a gate into her soul

3890528 the government wants to send a message of confidence to the people with the conviction that it is taking all measures and combining all efforts to overcome the difficult situation that is affecting the economy of our country
3890529 it believes that the country will resolve this crisis and emerge from it in a stronger position
3890530 the million dollar question is what the impact of higher cotton and energy costs are and to what degree we recover these cost increases and prices
3890531 we do not intend to pursue additional interests at this time
3890532 our discussions with the government of iraq remain confidential and we are unable to comment at this point in time
3890533 in the next five to ten years i see more consolidation in every region of the world
3890534 we should expect to see chinese automakers exporting to north america soon as well as european manufacturers bringing their small cars here to manufacture and sell here as well as export back home to take advantage of the weak dollar
3890535 weve had discussions with multiple companies in russia and hopefully well see some light at the end of the tunnel here by the end of the year
3890536 the rest of the regions its going to be more about working with other companies on say platforms or specific deals on buying products
3890537 at this stage theres no formal discussions going on but there was an inquiry
3890538 were not going to be putting any name plate on it until we can be rest assured it meets all of our standards
3890539 that has been the biggest delay in that product program it did not meet our standards
3890540 no one is going to buy a car company like this in the market that its in and expect okay why dont we see if we can go sell it now after one year
3890541 theyre holding on for the long term and well see what happens
3890542 i dont know what happens in three years or five years but those discussions we dont get involved in were busy enough trying to turn the place around
3890543 our hard work these past few years has demonstrated that atlas and wheatland are formidable players in their served markets
3890544 we are proud to become part of the nlmk steel family and believe the future is bright for the company and its dedicated employees
3890545 in the face of intense global competition jmcs remarkable management team and work force have built the premier global steel pipe and tube manufacturer
3890546 they have created economies of scale through two strategic acquisitions improved operations with lean manufacturing and efficiency techniques and grown sales through an intense focus on customer service at many plants the workforce has shared the benefits of this transformation via gain sharing programs nlmk is the right owner to take jmc to the next level
3890547 we are confident that the incorporation of jmcs quality assets into the nlmk group will prove to be a highly attractive investment for nlmks shareholders as well as a beneficial development for jmcs customers and employees
3890548 the markets of pipes and hollow structural sections are not linked with the consumers demand and are therefore more favourable
3890549 i dont think the politics will play any role here
3890550 no grounds to think that the americans will be opposing the purchase
3890551 naturally youre getting persistent concerns on that front because the housing data really isnt getting much better nor do i expect it will for a while
3890552 and that in turn is going to make any significant recovery in the financials bottom line some time off
3890553 there is an unbelievable amount of uncertainty there are really a bunch of crosswinds blowing around
3890554 the reality is the leading sectors the sectors that have been strong this year are in correction its kind of a weird situation i cant remember seeing that before
3890555 i dont know where the bottom is in oil and these other commodities but if you look at some of the supply demand stuff going on i think the odds are youre going to see a rebound in commodity prices
3890556 postponing the filing of the financial statements and management discussion and analysis for two business days will provide the corporation with sufficient time to finalize the transaction and properly report it as material subsequent events for the second quarter
3890557 the july retail sales report was much as expected plunging vehicle sales dragged down the headline figure and the rise in ex autos spending will have been eaten up by higher food and gasoline prices
3890558 cautious and uncertain consumers are watching their wallets and with the back to school shopping season underway that does not bode well for retailers
3890559 the consumer is still under enormous pressure as employment is declining real wages are down housing and stock market wealth are down and credit conditions continue to tighten and the surge of stimulus payments is now over

3890594 es w re sicher zweckm ig gewesen wenn die ganze sache auf etwas h herer ebene eingeleitet worden w re als auf der ebene eines gr nfl chenamtes
3890595 wenn man sich die verwaltungsstruktur der stadt berlin vorstellt kann es einen allerdings auch nicht berraschen dass solch ein amt existiert
3890596 damit aus diesem gel bnis eine dauerhafte tradition werden kann

3890602 es hat den anschein als ob die sicherheit des b rgers immer mehr zur privatsache wird und die polizei sich auf vielen kriminalit tsfeldern zur ckziehen muss das ist eine eindeutige auswirkung der rigiden k rzungspolitik des finanzsenators sarrazin auf die berliner polizei

3890607 the formula that youd like to stick by in this type of situation is win the home game and look for your points if its a draw or whatever it may be away from home
3890608 the last couple of times the home games have let us down a little bit
3890609 dont talk about how hott chris brown brad pitt or jesse mccartney is in front of us
3890610 i still dont know we will have to see it on tv because its much easier to see the important thing is we got a result and we have to improve for the second leg
3890611 it looked as if their defenders had forgotten that peter crouch had been sold to portsmouth in the close season
3890612 scoring four goals was important it was a european return the lads cared about it they played a good match
3890613 well have to be focused when we go there because this team scored five goals against celtic in a preliminary round match in 2005

3890615 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3890616 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

3890620 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3890621 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3890622 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3890623 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3890624 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3890625 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3890626 refrain from organizing and joining illegal gatherings and refrain from receiving donations sermons and preaching from overseas religious organizations and groups that have a purpose
3890627 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3890628 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3890844 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3890845 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3890846 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3890847 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3890848 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3890849 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3890850 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3890851 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory
3890852 i know that these countries they need help all kinds of help and when you come to a developed country i had the chance to train in good universities like mcgill universitys surgery ive been working in an excellent hospital here in sherbrooke and i feel it is my obligation to give some time and expertise to these poor populations
3890853 i was just looking for a place large enough for the instruments
3890854 if youre a musician you know youre not going to play steely dan without a significant amount of effort
3890855 it goes to show you how much everyone loves the music
3890856 the fact that theyre out there its kind of inspiring to us
3890857 i try to do the solo to do it again as closely as possible but its almost impossible
3890858 people are pretty impressed that we can get the right sound
3890859 its real art its not just make a splash on the radio for one or two years
3890860 this is music i hope and believe people will be listening to in a hundred years
3890861 i tried to find as many as possible off leash hikes
3890862 moving back to the boston area having lived out west where a dog can basically roam anywhere it was really important to find places to let my dog really run
3890863 water is very important for swimming and drinking and shade dogs overheat much faster than humans do
3890864 also i looked for nothing too rocky and you dont want broken glass
3890865 having grown up in the area i had some favorite spots from my childhood
3890866 and there are a lot of places i found out about in the course of researching the book
3890867 its a very small park 80 acres but it has nice views of the surrounding communities and for dogs in wellesley it is also an off leash opportunity
3890868 one that surprised me the most which i wasnt even going to go to but was persuaded to go to was callahan state park in framingham
3890869 the trustees of reservations has a lot of wonderful property along the charles
3890870 now that its clean it is a wonderful place to bring a dog for a swim
3890871 the berkshires are amazing for folks that like to hike further
3890872 mount watatic which is kind of in north central mass was another one that really surprised me it has beautiful sweeping views
3890873 you probably dont think about getting your dog in shape but just like people have different levels of activeness dogs have the same thing
3890874 i dont think they appreciate being weekend warriors as much as people do
3890875 hiking with dogs has become a controversial thing its a complex thing the interaction of hikers with dogs and hikers without dogs

3890879 los jugadores echamos ra ces y aqu silva se siente importante a pesar de las posibilidades que pueda tener quiere seguir con nosotros y queremos agradec rselo
3890880 el club ha llegado hasta donde ha podido y el jugador ha bajado tambi n hasta donde consideraba necesario
3890881 el valencia tiene muy claro que tipo de gesti n quiere llevar a cabo y no va acometer locuras ni se va a salir de las l neas generales para la estructura econ mica y deportiva actual ni para el futuro
3890882 si silva hubiera salido del valencia hubiera tenido donde elegir
3890883 las dos partes quer an llegar a un acuerdo y al final se ha producido de manera satisfactoria tanto el jugador como nosotros quer amos que siguiera muchos a os defendiendo al valencia y al final hemos llegado a un acuerdo que se preve a por las intenciones de ambas parte
3890884 lo que nos deja a todos muy contentos a todos es anunciar que el acuerdo es total para el jugador ha sido una decisi n muy importante y hay que recalcar el esfuerzo del valencia por mantener en su plantilla a un jugador como silva
3890885 no hemos trasladado al valencia ninguna oferta porque la prioridad del jugador era seguir aqu siempre y cuando se llegara a este acuerdo no bamos a revolver en temas que no ven an a cuento es importante que todos sepamos que el valencia ha hecho un esfuerzo muy grande y que el jugador ha mantenido esa prioridad desde el principio

3890892 the institution believes that right now there are no policy guidelines in place to address the impact of climate change to do with the infrastructure development
3890893 the government is putting a lot of money into infrastructure development and we believe all members of parliament should have some tangible guidelines to help them when they implement infrastructure developments in their respective electorates

3890931 having a word like that that you hear somebody use in a casual conversation or calling each other in school or in the movie like this one parent one dad describes to me its like being hit in the stomach punched in the stomach

3890939 the national telecommunications and information administration an agency of the department of commerce is the show stopper here
3890940 theyre the only department of the government that isnt on board with securing the domain name system and unfortunately theyre also the ones who commerce deputized to oversee icann
3890941 the biggest difference is that once the root is signed and the public key is out it will be put in every operating system and will be on all cds from apple microsoft suse freebsd etc
3890942 the only one you have to have to go down the tree
3890943 a few years ago there were still technical hurdles to actually signing and using dnssec but in the past few years a lot of software tools both commercial and open source have come out and now its a completely solved problem
3890944 all thats left is the far less tractable purely political problem
3890945 arguing over who gets to hold the cryptographic keys in the long run should wait until were not facing a critical threat
3890946 we are committed to taking no action that would have the potential to adversely affect the operational stability of the dns
3890947 while there is increasing pressure to secure the dns ntia must work with all stakeholders and consider all possible solutions
3890948 currently dnssec is the only mechanism known to protect against the kaminsky attack
3890949 it is not clear that other solutions will provide the same level of protection as dnssec
3890950 then the issue becomes political because there seems to be the perception that the introduction of a key guardian changes the current policies
3890951 we would want to bring the editing creation and signing of the root zone file here

3890965 as you were on the floor god was dealing with you you really wanted to surrender all to god but there was something holding you down and that was hurt from past relationships and church hurt but god says just let it go yes you should have been in position about 5 years ago but just let it go dont despise being overlooked ignored or passed by god has delivered you from the root this morning you have a ministry of healing for hurting women and god needed you to be free first no longer will you ever have to have concessions saying ok maybe next year your time really is now and this is the set time for you and favor richly belongs to you receive it in jesus name i dont know you but god does so bless you
3890966 i was trying not to look over because i knew she was right there
3890967 so i just closed my eyes and tried to focus on all the hard sessions id done and tried to focus on my own race
3890968 i love the pressure and i love the nerves thats how i get the best out of myself
3890969 being at the olympics is obviously the pinnacle for every swimmer so i love the challenge and doing the best knowing ive done all the work and this is why im here to race
3890970 i put a lot of effort into this preparation so im really excited to see the results
3890971 it was a great battle and thats what the olympics is all about
3890972 having natalie coughlin there really take it out was really good for me to get me out there
3890973 i knew that coventry was going to be there the whole race and i knew shes extremely tough
3890974 it was really great for me to have her there pushing me along
3890975 it was extremely close and i didnt realise how close it was until i saw the scoreboard at the end
3890976 ive got the relay yet so no celebrating until im done

3890981 you have to face it no model has ever successfully forecast any future climate in quantitative terms it is surely because they incorporate only one of the many influences on the climate increases in greenhouse gases why should any of us believe them

3890993 i believe in some things and ill stand by those things and ill fight for those things
3890994 how much substance can you cram into a 30 second ad
3890995 good evening thomas are you and hottentot doing your best to attract every mosquito within five miles
3890996 i say let me give you directions back to christiaan fouries farm so that we can retrieve pete as well as the qabala
3890997 fortunately i do remember how to get there and it will take us several hours if im not mistaken just out of curiosity how did you come to know christiaan fourie and why do you trust him with the qabala
3890998 someone or rather something tried to steal the qabala if it hadnt been for christiaans two ridgebacks leeu jagter and duiwel hond it probably would have been gone by now they both began barking and raising all kinds of a ruckus just after it got dark christiaan and i heard the dogs scuffling with something in the barn and ran out there only to find leeu jagter and duiwel hond rendered unconscious both dogs look like they were dragged ten or fifteen feet fortunately both of them survived their experience and now appear to be doing reasonably well the whole floor of the barn is covered with these strange footprints
3890999 what kind of creature could throw two raging ridgeback hounds that weigh about 40 kilos apiece around like they were toys these dogs have been bred and trained to track lions through the brush and hold them at bay what could have caught them so quickly and dragged them that distance
3891000 pete why dont you and thomas check out the qabala to see if anything was taken or damaged ill get with you after hottentot and i have had a chance to check on the condition of leeu jagter and duiwel hond
3891001 thomas i think you better get out here and see this
3891002 looks like someone removed the front tripod cowling cover and did some damage
3891003 it certainly looks like someone is trying their best to sabotage our efforts not only does it appear they want to know more about our technology but it seems like they want to make sure we cant time travel for a while either we need to come up with a plan of action to reduce the likelihood of a repeat occurrence the aggressiveness our adversary showed in obtaining our technology as well as their overall wanton destructiveness of one of the qabalas coils would lead me to believe that there is a high probability that they would hurt or kill anyone who got in their way as a result i feel it is necessary that we take appropriate precautionary measures
3891004 if someone would have been in the barn when this person or thing was present chances are their life would have been in great danger what do you recommend
3891005 despite christiaans kind offer of hospitality to stay at the main house i think we should stay in the barn and immediately start standing watch over the qabala until we return to pretoria day after tomorrow well work in four hour shifts starting at midnight thomas youll take the first shift pete the second shift and ill take the third shift then well repeat since i have trained both of you extensively in the use of firearms i will issue each of you a pistol to be returned when we are back in pretoria hottentot will remain in the barn and christiaan is willing to let both of his ridgebacks come back tomorrow now since we have two hours left until midnight lets discuss the extent of the damage to the qabala the first thing i would like to know is whats involved in getting our time ship back to fully operational status
3891006 although the coil located in the front tripod was extensively damaged as was the coils cooling jacket we have two spares available for each it will take me about five hours to install the replacement components and recharge the coil cooling system plus another two hours to make the necessary harmonic adjustments
3891007 being down for two weeks could create a major problem for us in terms of being able to take advantage of the strong power flow emanating from the transvaal grid point thomas didnt you tell me earlier today that your recent grid point measurements seem to indicate an exceptionally strong increase in the power flow
3891008 it would appear that the grid point power flow has increased by almost seven percent since yesterday this is the strongest measurement ive ever taken of this particular grid point what has become apparent is that the power flow of the transvaal grid point like the one located on great abaco island in the bahamas can fluctuate wildly over a period of several weeks or even months however since weve been here in south africa the power flow of this particular grid point has been on the rise with the accumulation of more data over the next week or two pete and i should be able to come up with a fairly accurate prediction equation concerning the power flow
3891009 however from what your saying there seems to be no assurance that the power flow of the transvaal grid point will be near a high point in a week or two when the qabala is fully operational
3891010 until we have some actual data to predict from its just a gamble all i can say right now is that grid point energy flow for tonight seems to be at a maximum compared to earlier readings
3891011 unfortunately that doesnt do us much good since the qabala is non operational
3891012 if we only had another time reference indicator along as a spare to take advantage of the high grid point energy tonight
3891013 well as far as im concerned im glad the time reference indicator is gone
3891014 im afraid if it was still around we would rely on it to heavily and risk the possibility of getting lost in the time fabric im afraid thomas that it did not perform as well as you and i anticipated and quite frankly it almost cost you your life back to the drawing board on this one dont forget how much trouble col stuart and i had trying to reprogram that thing so that the qabala could get back to specific vector points in order to save your life fortunately because we designed it i was very familiar with it and was able to get the qabala to limp back to the present allah be praised for protecting us
3891015 i personally didnt care for the analog attributes of the device nor the excessively high voltages and screen grid vacuum tubes used in the initial design
3891016 i take it that neither one of you are especially concerned that the time reference indicator has been stolen and that two of christiaans best lion hounds were almost killed
3891017 its just that whoever stole the time reference indicator got a lemon it was a poor initial design and thomas and i can do a better job when we redesign it if someone tries to use it in its current state there is a high probability that they would get lost in the time fabric were rather lucky that situation did not happen to us
3891018 however right now i want to know more about the person or thing that damaged one of the qabalas coils and stole the time reference indicator just exactly what were their motives
3891019 ill bet you anything that reason has to do with the high energy level emanating from the transvaal grid point at this particular time
3891020 someone surmised that we would try and take advantage of the exceptionally high energy levels currently emanating from the grid point to send the qabala back through the time fabric colonel i would suspect that if we go back to the transvaal grid point we will find our saboteur and thief
3891021 or at least get a clue as to who or what did this
3891022 gentlemen im inclined to agree with your conclusions tomorrow after all of us have had a chance to get some sleep well hitch up the qabala to the land rover and head back to the transvaal ill inform christiaan tonight of our intentions
3891023 well gentlemen we always suspected someone else was using the grid point structure for inter dimensional travel
3891024 well do my eyes deceive me or do we have a real live alien on our hands
3891025 looks like weve caught the culprit who damaged the front tripod coil on the qabala and also stole the time reference indicator not to mention what he did to leeu jagter and duiwel hond yesterday and to christiaan today
3891026 yes colonel but what are we going to do with it im not sure how we can communicate with this creature much less come to some sort of understanding or rather comprehension about things should we really put our pistols away is that pale bluish goo oozing from its hand some sort of blood
3891027 this creature dropped its weapon earlier and has since been cornered by the ridgebacks its obviously hurt and bleeding and probably very frightened of the dogs as well as us
3891028 lets leash up the ridgebacks and get a closer look at this alien
3891029 it obviously comes from a civilization with technology vastly superior to ours
3891030 i would think we could probably begin to communicate with it very quickly perhaps we should start with some mathematical sequencing algorithms
3891031 thats a very insightful statement doctor but it wont be necessary
3891032 i know the aliens thoughts or rather the thoughts of the guiding intelligence that controls it
3891033 are you saying that you can communicate with this creature do you have some sort of telepathic linkup to this alien
3891034 i know it seems unbelievable but ever since my experience yesterday with the being of light ive had an incredible ability to know what others are thinking even to the point where i know someones innermost thoughts as well as the sorrow and pain they carry with them
3891035 yes believe it or not it applies to at least this alien and the guiding intelligence behind it
3891036 well then ask it or rather them why they stole our time reference indicator
3891037 the time reference indicator was taken for apparently two reasons
3891038 the first reason as we guessed earlier was because the aliens had planned for some heavy traffic through the grid point tonight and our presence here would have required that they modify their departure plans which they did not want to do the second reason has to do with some sort of error or contamination inherent in the design of our time reference indicator which was corrected by these aliens apparently the analog circuit in the time reference indicator was subject to a serious malfunction which occasionally allowed the magnetic field vectors to merge together rather than separate out in an orthogonal pattern this is the major reason why both of you had a problem yesterday locking the qabalas time reference indicator into a specific date this distortion also had the effect of creating the intense magnetic fields the qabala experienced anytime it entered or left the time fabric as im sure you noticed tonight none of the alien ships going through the grid point exhibited any intense magnetic anomalies like the qabala did yesterday furthermore the aliens were afraid that if this distortion of the magnetic fields was not corrected immediately it could have a disastrous effect on the grid point making it useless since this grid point has served as one of the aliens main entry points into this world as well as others for thousands of years they could not allow this to happen this is why they stole the time reference indicator yesterday in order to modify it and then to return it tonight understand that this was primarily done for their benefit rather than ours
3891039 but if it hadnt been for those magnetic anomalies the qabala experienced you wouldnt be here today thomas it was the strong magnetic force fields that col stuart and i had to manipulate in order to come back and save your life besides look what the aliens did yesterday to christiaans two ridgebacks leeu jagter and duiwel hond and what they did just twenty minutes ago to christiaan all three were knocked unconscious and could have been killed
3891040 the alien used a mild stun force to render all three unconscious in their respective situations in fact that strange looking tool we found next to christian was used for that specific purpose the alien dropped it and the time reference indicator when one of the ridgebacks attacked it and bit its hand the alien intended to gently stun christiaan and the two ridgebacks in order to return the modified time reference indicator to the qabala but of course it never got that far although it succeeded in stunning christian it had lost the element of surprise and still had two angry ridgeback hounds to confront with a third on its way unarmed and fearing even more retribution from the ridgebacks it ran to the qabala opened the portal and jumped inside the cabin the ridgebacks quickly followed the alien and surrounded the portal holding it at bay and not allowing it to leave
3891041 colonel the aliens had nothing to do with the damage inflicted on the qabalas coil and cooling jacket
3891042 apparently this damage was inflicted after the aliens had departed with the time reference indicator and while the two ridgebacks hounds were still incapacitated well just who did it then
3891043 i want to know who is responsible for this act of sabotage and why
3891044 all i know now is that the aliens did not do it nor do they do appear to know who was responsible
3891045 absolutely because i sense the truth from their guiding intelligence
3891046 with my new gift i know when someone or something is not reflecting actual events
3891047 well since you have bridged through to this creatures guiding intelligence you can tell us more about them
3891048 all of those things became apparent to me when i was dealing with the aliens guiding intelligence
3891049 well im sure the colonel and i are all ears
3891050 they have no intention of interfering with the affairs of our planet unless we do something that could potentially impact the well being of our galaxy and other life forms
3891051 im glad that other creatures such as these aliens can be as concerned about the possible destruction of our world as some of us are this is a significant step for mankind and its relationship to all living creatures
3891052 thomas i am especially interested in knowing where these creatures are from
3891053 these particular aliens really dont know the total number of existing groups across the universe as they have encountered many different civilizations at various levels of technical and intellectual development and they are sure many more undiscovered civilizations exist however there appears to be three primary groups of aliens that visit earth on a fairly frequent basis this alien belongs to a civilization that is based in the zeta reticulan star system the aliens have studied us for thousands of years and have been fascinated by our gradual development into more complex but not necessarily more intelligent creatures they are amazed that our rapid growth in technology has not been accompanied by a commensurate growth in our cognitive development what really puzzles them is that we have been able to make some major technological advances with the locus of control being primarily at the individual level this is unique among most well developed civilizations that they have studied in the past from the aliens perspective the more primitive the civilization the more the locus of control and the emotions are on an individual level the more advanced the civilization the more the locus of control is under the auspices of some sort of guiding intelligence which is the directing factor for all activity other than purely maintenance functions in fact the aliens guiding intelligence tends to look at the genetic composition of the human gene pool as the real intelligence behind mankind and prefers to communicate with it rather than us however how this is done is currently unclear to me
3891054 but ill repeat my earlier question what are we going to do with this creature
3891055 its companions will be back here shortly to pick it up and leave this star system
3891056 in fact they should be here within about a minute apparently another alien was to accompany this one down to our camp but col stuart startled the aliens when he fired his flare gun at their craft strangely they thought they were under assault by another group of aliens and immediately left the area
3891057 true to my prediction off in the distance we could hear the deep pulsating sound of the large alien craft as it approached the camp hovering about a hundred feet above the camp floor a streak of light shot down from the ship startling us and immediately engulfing the alien causing it to disappear the deep pulsating sound emanating from the alien craft started a crescendo in frequency until it became almost unbearable to our ears and then as quickly as it came it sped off in a northerly direction and was gone
3891058 its unfortunate that we did not have more time to spend with that alien so we could gain more insight into their technology
3891059 well i for one intend to check out the time reference indicator to see how they modified it
3891060 i thought you said that the aliens had modified this unit
3891061 wait a minute pete i know where they made the modifications remember earlier when i said that the alien had informed me about changes to the time reference indicator it was at this point that a vision of a vacuum tube formed in my mind lets pull a couple of the tubes out of their sockets and look at them
3891062 each tube is a work of art look at the detail apparently the aliens took each tube that was in the unit and made a far more elaborate duplicate i bet that the electromagnetic distortion and light wave emissions for these tubes are far below normal
3891063 we all know that these type of analog components are not at the forefront of technology today theres a major move afoot throughout the entire electronics industry to move towards transistor based technology i guess the aliens felt it was easier to redesign existing components rather than to share any new technology with us
3891064 well colonel they did tell me they were not here to interfere with our world
3891065 the aliens felt using more advanced electronic circuitry in the time reference indicator would be considered interference in that respect they have been true to their word
3891066 looks like we got some answers to our questions tonight
3891067 we even got our time reference indicator fixed and approved by the little green men what more could we ask for
3891068 umm okay are you a client here would you like to make an appt
3891069 no im at my wits end i need to speak with someone
3891070 im sorry maam this isnt an emergency facility im not sure what you need
3891071 well ive just had it my grand daughter wont quit taking her diaper off i mean i put it on she takes it off i put it on she takes it off i just dont know what to do
3891072 shes 1 and a half shes too young to be a stripper i mean im starting to think maybe theres some sexual abuse going on why wont she keep the damn diaper on
3891073 well maam thats a legitimate concern if you really suspect child abuse you should call child protective services are there any signs of abuse
3891074 well i dont know what are the signs of abuse
3891075 maam im not really qualified to offer advice perhaps you could find some information on the internet have you spoken with her mother
3891076 her mother doesnt know her ass from a hole in the ground i mean i know the babys bored cause i keep her in the pen all day but i have the t v on and she can watch the dogs and all i just dont know what to do about this diaper thing
3891077 well maybe its like the pick the toys up game you know you pick them up they throw them down you pick them up etc maybe its a game its not like she knows she should have a diaper on you know
3891078 look i need you to tell me how to get her to keep her diaper on
3891079 we tried that she still gets the diaper off from underneath it
3891080 okay well maybe you could put a onesie on her or a long t shirt safety pinned at the bottom or you could just let her be naked
3891081 well i guess thats the way she came into the world
3891082 if youre really concerned maam you could take her to the emergency room or maybe call dial a nurse or contact cps im not sure what else to tell you
3891083 well thank you i feel better just having someone to talk to about it how late will you be at this number
3891084 oh im sorry im just on my way out good luck though

3891091 the john bull character was that of a drinking man hard headed down to earth averse to intellectualism fond of dogs horses ale and country sports during the napoleonic wars john bull became the national symbol of freedom of loyalty to king and country and of resistance to french aggression he was the ordinary man in the street who would fight napoleon with his bare hands if necessary by the 1800s he was seen as a more assertive figure in domestic politics as well prepared to criticise the royal family and the government giving those outside the traditional political process a voice john bull became so familiar that his name frequently appeared in books plays periodical titles and as a brand name or trademark although frequently used through world war ii john bull has been seen less often since the 1950s as uncle sam is the iconic representation of the united states so john bull is the personification of the character of the english honest generous straightforward with a zest for life and ready to stand up and fight for what he believes in

3891112 home prices in the u s are likely to start to stabilize or touch bottom sometime in the first half of 2009 though prices could continue to drift lower through 2009 and beyond
3891113 a necessary condition for an end to the current global financial crisis is the stabilization of the price of homes in the u s stable home prices will clarify the level of equity in homes the ultimate collateral support for much of the financial worlds mortgage backed securities we wont really know the market value of the asset side of the banking systems balance sheet and hence banks capital until then
3891114 public policy can hasten this process by not prematurely propping up housing starts and by expanding the underlying demand for homes generally the most effective initiative though politically difficult would be a major expansion in quotas for skilled immigrants skilled immigrants tend to form new households by far the most important source of new home demand the number of new households in the u s is increasing at a rate of about 800 000 a year of which about a third are immigrants perhaps 150 000 of those are loosely classified as skilled a double or tripling of this number would markedly accelerate the absorption of unsold housing inventory for sale and hence help stabilize prices
3891115 its a good idea foreclosures dont help anybody its costly to the holder of the mortgage and disaster for the homeowner in the days before we sliced and diced mortgages into securities when the borrower got into trouble hed come to the assistant vice president of the local s amp l and get agreement to stretch out the payments or restructure the loans in a deal that worked for both parties until the recent surge in foreclosures more than half of all loans that went into foreclosure were cured without the sale of the property
3891116 u s home prices will stabilize only as the current huge 800 000 excess of vacant single family homes for sale is dramatically reduced and prices deflate to the level consistent with the historical rate of return on owning a home that prevailed before the price surge in the u s and elsewhere
3891117 new single family home completions are currently just barely under the rate of home demand generated by household formation and replacement needs only early next year will the current suppressed level of housing starts be reflected in completion levels consistent with a sufficiently rapid rate of liquidation to materially reduce the bloated inventory excess
3891118 we seem to be approaching a peak in the number of new foreclosures though the number in foreclosure will continue to rise for awhile
3891119 its the imbalance of supply and demand which causes prices to go down but its ultimately the valuation process of the use of the commodity which tells you where the bottom is for example the grain markets can have a huge excess of corn or wheat but the price never goes to zero itll stabilize at some level of prices where people are willing to hold the excess inventory we have little history but the same thing is surely true in housing as well we will get to the point where there will be willing holders of vacant single family dwellings and that will no longer act to depress the price level
3891120 the issue is how you get a viable mortgage market when this is all over what happens in 2010 or 2011
3891121 it does not alter the flawed model a new regulator does not have that capability
3891122 this was the ideal opportunity to come to grips with what is a fundamentally flawed model which privatizes profits and socializes losses which is fiscally tolerable in small amounts but in trillions of dollars it isnt
3891123 they should have wiped out the shareholders nationalized the institutions with legislation that they are to be reconstituted with necessary taxpayer support to make them financially viable as five or 10 individual privately held units and auctioned off the affordable housing programs should be put into gnma or another government agency by the time we have the next mortgage crisis the five or 10 individual companies would have diversified into other areas of finance and maybe one or two of them would fail but having been significantly downsized systemic risk would be avoided
3891124 when bear stearns was bailed out it was inevitable theres no credible argument for bailing out bear stearns and not the gses
3891125 untrue the law that stipulates that gses are not backed by the full faith and credit of the u s government is disbelieved the market believes the government guarantee is there foreigners believe the guarantee is there the only fiscal change is for someone to change the bookkeeping

3891138 its never that thought out maybe more just because ive never gone for a character specifically
3891139 ive always gone towards a story and those stories have interested me
3891140 this is two fold because its a genre that i really dont think ive done even though people have compared the lost boys to a horror film or flatliners to a horror film which they werent in my book they were thrillers
3891141 the lost boys was a smidgen of a lot of stuff from comedy to pop culture and on purpose thats exactly what joel schumacher wanted to do with it with scary moments in it and the vanishing was a thriller to me it was not a horror film this was really specifically going after a certain audience
3891142 and then you start to try to walk out and theres 300 people behind you and your kids looking at you so youre stuck and the slow ride up is just torture and then its done you walk out going wasnt that great and then four years later you forget the front part and you do it again
3891143 i wanted to work with alex aja because i really loved the hills have eyes i thought it harkened back to these horror films that i liked which were the original amityville my fathers remake of invasion of the body snatchers the changeling the exorcist the shining and all of those films were character based i felt that this one was character based it was a drama for all intents and purposes up until one quarter of the way through the film where youre seeing a guy whos living on his sisters couch hes at an all time low with regards to his own confidence at any moment in the movie instead of going to get the job at the security place he could have gone to fight the investigation of him as a police officer it could have gone that way it was a straight up drama and i felt that that gives you an opportunity to really become invested in this guys situation this family that hes estranged from what he wants to do with his life and where hes at hes at the bottom and you want him to go up and then all of a sudden this horrific circumstance arises and it moves into this genre i was really attracted to that story and that idea as much as i was anything
3891144 given the history and the track record maybe those are the kinds of stories that when i go to see something i really respond to i really responded to the gene hackman character in the french connection thats a really tortured guy he had this great scene where he wakes up and hes handcuffed to his own bed by the ankle and the girl is running naked through his apartment thats not a healthy guy
3891145 there are so many films nick nolte in 48 hours was that guy i have always been drawn to those characters as a viewer and as a fan i guess ive been attracted certainly on some level to those characters i feel like i understand them on some level and i think those films are interesting and certainly with something like jack bauer they were interesting to someone else too
3891146 for instance in the changing room sequence i never saw a lady screaming and i never saw anyone on fire he would just say specifically this is where i want you to look for this because this is going to happen and this is going to happen he would just be really clear about what he wants to do alex proyas when we did dark city had to do a lot of that as well there is a relief in someone who is so clear about absolutely everything that theyre going to do whereas i have worked with people too where cgi is not something theyre familiar with theyre good at storytelling with a great style of camera but they say its going to kind of be like this and the second i hear kind of im like okay well do you kind of want me to do this or do you kind of want me to do that so theres a huge relief with someone like alex

3891215 lets not even get into the treason mccain committed while in vietnam no lets give over a night at the convention to that theme make a 20 state media buy around it bang that drum freddy
3891216 i had no idea there were so many retards in this country

3891218 o k ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital
3891219 he received the nations third highest award the silver star for treason he provided aid and comfort to the enemy
3891220 i just went with the regular old yellow squash instead of springing for the organic kind
3891221 the organic kind just means it had crap in the fertilizer
3891222 yeah i figured id save money go with the bug spray and keep peoples feces off my veggies
3891223 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
3891224 christopher s stewart discusses the wide availability of grey market u s consumer and other goods in iran and the role that iranians play in dubai mr stewarts research for the article included a trip to iran where he went inside stores searching for american products
3891225 i like some of the guys ideas but hed put me out of work cutting the military like that
3891226 we wont stop racism its not our job so if youre racist go right ahead
3891227 it doesnt matter if we lose the election so long as we stay in iraq until our honor is satisfied
3891228 cool its all sewn up i dont have to do anything more some anonymous delegate will do my bidding for me in st paul
3891229 he cant win concluding nearly all news coverage if ron paul would have gotten just fair media treatment he would have take everything by a landslide
3891230 a campaign that can at least find its own ass if it put its hands in its back pockets
3891231 i am shocked that such a thoughtful writer would make such an illiterate mistake

3891233 were going to eventually make a 24 movie one day if fans are still interested by then
3891234 its so hard for the writers to just even get through the season theyre very good but its just the equivalent of making 12 films a year and then they have to come up with a whole new idea in the break for the next year
3891235 he said ive got an ear on my second or third shelf in his room

3891237 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3891238 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3891239 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3891240 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3891241 database of detailed first person profiles of more than 480 000 r amp d professionals and scholars
3891242 weve never had these kinds of hallways before that join buildings
3891243 weve added lunch room space weve added some extra space in the back for the lunchroom manager they used to have to go outside to get to their food out of the coolers and the freezers even in the rain
3891244 it is not quite complete thats the reason that the fire chief is here were trying to get the old building and the new building fire alarm to talk to each other
3891245 authorizing an investigation of the police departments policies and procedures in regard to the security detail appointing a committee of the metropolitan council to conduct such investigation

3891247 targets in new york city including the subway times square and the statue of liberty
3891248 these findings may suggest a new approach to treating serious strep infections by supporting our bodys natural defense system
3891249 lacking this single protease the mutant strep strain was easily killed by human neutrophils
3891250 in addition the mutant strep bacteria no longer produced a spreading infection when injected into the skin of experimental mice
3891251 in addition to attempting to kill the bacteria directly with standard antibiotics new treatment strategies could be targeted to inhibit the strep protease and thereby disarm the pathogen making it susceptible to clearance by our normal immune defenses
3891252 the discovery that this protein called platelet derived growth factor alpha receptor pdgfr is involved in cmv infection suggests a new target for anti viral therapies
3891253 every hour the virus causes one child in the to become disabled
3891254 by understanding how cmv gets into a patients cell we can identify new and better ways of treating the infection or even of preventing it altogether
3891255 and this virus has been found in several forms of cancer particularly brain tumors
3891256 moreover this growth factor receptor has been known to drive cancer so our findings suggest that its activation by cmv may promote tumor growth if further studies verify this it could help us develop new ways of treating these kinds of cancers
3891257 somehow you get the feeling these people dont share the same economic downturn as the rest of us with higher food and energy costs the time for a bond issue this great must wait
3891258 man o man can these people spend our money or what
3891259 the money i would save is not worth the headache it would be to fight the crowds i will avoid the stores this weekend if at all possible

3891265 i think in the long run probably the death penalty is going to disappear in asia as it seems to be doing in many parts of the rest of the world
3891266 the most dramatic execution decreases occurred in the rapidly developing democracies of south korea and taiwan but declines have also occurred in nations such as india and malaysia
3891267 when development and plural democracy take root in asia the decline of the death penalty usually comes sooner rather than later
3891268 i will say that the frame that regards the death penalty as a human rights issue has become more conspicuous and salient in asia than it was in the past
3891269 and when you frame the death penalty as a human rights issue instead of a crime issue you invite anxiety and concern and resistance to the death penalty because after all its a state killing
3891270 the concern of this court is that in these lawsuits potentially meritorious legal and factual defenses are not being litigated and instead the federal judiciary is being used as a hammer by a small group of plaintiffs to pound settlements out of unrepresented defendants
3891271 rule 11 b 3 requires that a representation in a pleading have evidentiary support and one wonders if the plaintiffs are intentionally flouting that requirement in order to make their discovery efforts more convenient or to avoid paying the proper filing fees in my view the court would be well within its power to direct the plaintiffs to show cause why they have not violated rule 11 b with their allegations respecting joinder i t is difficult to ignore the kind of gamesmanship that is going on here these plaintiffs have devised a clever scheme to obtain court authorized discovery prior to the service of complaints but it troubles me that they do so with impunity and at the expense of the requirements of rule 11 b 3 because they have no good faith evidentiary basis to believe the cases should be joined

3891273 i nfringement of the distribution right requires an actual dissemination of either copies or phonorecords 2 nimmer on copyright 8 11 a at 8 124 1
3891274 p laintiffs unreasonably rejected or sought to suppress evidence to the extent it tended to exonerate defendant
3891275 n either the parties submissions nor the courts own research has revealed any case holding the mere owner of an internet account contributorily or vicariously liable for the infringing activities of third persons
3891276 i see no reason for the court to take immediate action in this case as there is no evidence that records are about to be destroyed
3891277 if the owner of the shared folder simply provides a member of the public with access to the work and the means to make an unauthorized copy the owner is not liable as a primary infringer of the distribution right but rather is potentially liable as a secondary infringer of the reproduction right
3891278 t he inducement rule is a sensible one for copyright we adopt it here holding that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement
3891279 plaintiff must present at least some facts to show the plausibility of their allegations of copyright infringement however plaintiffs have presented no facts that would indicate that this allegation is anything more than speculation
3891280 plaintiffs are ordered to file any future cases of this nature against one defendant at a time and may not join defendants for their convenience
3891281 a n overwhelming majority of cases brought by recording companies against individuals are resolved without so much as an appearance by the defendant usually through default judgment or stipulated dismissal the defendant does cannot question the propriety of joinder if they do not set foot in the courthouse
3891282 n either floridas litigation privilege nor the noerr pennington doctrine serves as a shield for sham litigation
3891283 the court is unaware of any other authority that authorizes the ex parte subpoena requested by plaintiffs
3891284 plaintiffs contend that unless the court allows ex parte immediate discovery they will be irreparably harmed
3891285 p laintiffs can cite to no case foreclosing the applicability of the due process clause to the aggregation of minimum statutory damages proscribed under the copyright act on the other hand lindor cites to case law and to law review articles suggesting that in a proper case a court may extend its current due process jurisprudence prohibiting grossly excessive punitive jury awards to prohibit the award of statutory damages mandated under the copyright act if they are grossly in excess of the actual damages suffered
3891286 d istributing unlawful copies of a copyrighted work does violate the copyright owners distribution right and as a result constitutes copyright infringement
3891287 t his court finds that defendants use of the same isp and p2p networks to allegedly commit copyright infringement is without more insufficient for permissive joinder under rule 20 this court will sever not only the moving defendants from this action but all other doe defendants except doe 2

3891425 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it

3891429 the board determined that userra specifically superseded any contract agreement or other matter limiting an appellants right to bring a userra claim to the board
3891430 reservists are often met with resistance and red tape when attempting to resolve their claims administratively through their union
3891431 they need the option to pursue their claim in front of the board
3891432 the employment rights awarded to military personnel based on their dedicated service should not be waived because of union membership
3891433 its very difficult to replace him not only with bat and ball but in the dressing room as well he gives us a lot of advice and comes up with brilliant ideas so its going to be a big loss

3891441 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime
3891442 not every wrong or even every violation of the law is a crime in this instance the two joint reports found only violations of the civil service laws
3891443 its the last thing we want and we are confident that wont happen i am confident they will still be in there and be in the hunt for a place in the finals in eight weeks time obviously both tasman and ourselves are keen for them to continue in 2008
3891444 we are doing everything we can to offer assistance for 2008 and beyond as we are with northland as well
3891445 we are not just talking about financial assistance there are a number of other things to take into account 2009 is a long way away yet
3891446 we are trying to ascertain specific reasons why tasman and northland have been differentiated from the rest of the competition and why they have not been invited to participate
3891447 we have got no confirmation or reply from new zealand on the tour as yet and now it would not be possible for us to arrange the series even if they say they are coming
3891448 on my own time im taking care of women who have a need and im going to continue to deliver babies
3891449 the irony of a liberal democrat showcasing his faith is not lost on gary bauer a leading conservative religious activist
3891450 the use of words expressing something other than the literal intention
3891451 she and other investors stand to gain a substantial return on their investment if gasoline prices stay high and municipal state and even the federal governments start using natural gas as their primary fuel source if gasoline prices fall alternative fuels and the cost to convert fleets over to them become less and less attractive
3891452 a lot of what hes trying to do is add value to a stranded asset hes obviously got millions of dollars on the line
3891453 well god if we got 86 billion barrels of oil sitting out there why dont we go drill it and produce it and lower the price of gasoline to 2
3891454 when they push one of those documents in front on me and say we need another 100 million
3891455 not to mention the thousands of sliced up birds and other wildlife that have become wind power casualties
3891456 why isnt obama doing better in the polls the answer no one wants to hear
3891457 does anyone believe that it is possible to win the nomination without over these next two months raising all these issues on him wont a single tape of the reverend jeremiah wright going off on america with obama sitting there be a game ender
3891458 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared towards showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3891459 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3891460 the internal discord over whether to attack obama led some of her own staff to spin reporters to try to downplay the significance of her criticisms the result for clinton was the worst of both worlds the conflicting message exacerbated her reputation for negativity without affording her whatever benefits a sustained attack might have yielded
3891461 in the days leading up to ohio and texas the campaign kept arguing over whether to air the 3 a
3891462 there certainly was a definite cockiness that democrats felt once they regained control of congress and ive also felt it was a misplaced cockiness
3891463 youve got a lot of conditions that are similar to 1932 and similar to 1980 a very unpopular president and the party brand badly hurt
3891464 but we wont know if its going to happen until late
3891465 i dont think you see leads in presidential races over 5 points in this day and age hes averaged leads of 3 points since spring the key is that obama hasnt closed the sale
3891466 it wasnt until reagan reached the threshold that he was able to close the sale
3891467 there is something about obama that is causing something of drag
3891468 this may sound kind of harsh but if the democratic nominee were a white male from a red or purple state the theory would be dead on that this would be set up there would be a very very high probability for a democratic landslide
3891469 youve never had a young guy win by such a large margin post war
3891470 the conditions are ripe for either a near landslide maybe 53 percent or a landslide
3891471 they even killed female goats because their private parts were not covered and their tails were pointed upward which they said was haram they regarded the cucumber as male and tomato asfemale women were not allowed to buy cucumbers only men
3891472 i saw them slaughter a nine year old boy like a sheep because his family didnt pledge allegiance to them
3891473 al qaedas very heavy handed killing of civilians backfired on them the sunnis just wouldnt stand for it any more
3891474 make this city better i dont care what you have to do just do it make it better for us for your son
3891475 recruiting is hard its just finding the needles in the haystack
3891476 it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store
3891477 russian occupying forces are continuing movements across georgia despite the ceasefire
3891478 georgian forces have begun their pull back toward tbilisi but no active withdrawal has yet been observed
3891479 i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3891480 the sight of russian tanks in gori russian tanks in senaki russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by
3891481 a thai nun told her the new name would bring her good luck
3891482 hi im charley rangel let me talk of all of charlie rangels successes
3891483 charley rangel dont have any opponents there is no one that doesnt like me charley rangel even those people who says those mean things about charley rangel on the floor in the house they like charley rangel
3891484 look at all these people who came over on a boat and swear they own everything
3891485 the commissioners who were in charge of the report at that time wouldnt have had a mobile phone or a pc on their desk no digital cameras no e tags e mail no e anything there were no high speed computers for individuals or private industry with which they could do data matching and data mining and no high tech surveillance cameras
3891486 first and foremost there is not going to be any real immediate impact in terms of changes of investment in either it infrastructure or security infrastructure
3891487 part one is going to take a good 12 months to get all the actual regulations set out then there will have to be some sort of compliance period so were several years out from things really hitting the ground and organisations having to show compliance
3891488 but at the same time businesses should be looking carefully at the recommendations and the potential impact they will have on their business processes their business models and the infrastructure that supports all of those activities
3891489 that may affect internal practices and how security controls are applied i suspect many organisations will have to look very carefully at how they manage employee data and ask themselves if we have to treat that as private data what are the implications
3891490 notification of a data breach to the government and affected individuals is actually a public relations activity a marketing function so organisations will have to take their incident response and incident management teams and integrate them with pr
3891491 the reality is there probably wont be any more data breach activity than normal were just going to hear and talk about every one now which is a healthy thing because it provides transparency and establishes security performance as a market differentiator but it will be painful for a few years
3891492 so that even if the technology changes we will still have the eleven commandments as i call them
3891493 lowly flight attendant bow before me and scrub this microscopic stain from my seat or feel the power of ohstain if you do not i shall elbow you in bosom and curse your digestive tract
3891494 if you are capable of getting pregnant than you are old enough to have a baby
3891495 if i had a hammer id hammer in the morning
3891496 tie a boy to the right man and he almost never goes wrong
3891497 give priority to family those kids around your feet will be grown up and gone before you know it dont let the opportunity of these days slip away from you when you stand where i am today the relationship with those you love will outweigh every other good thing in your life
3891498 this clearly goes against the conditions of their permit which require that they should only centre on their religion and religious activities it will earn the herald another warning letter and probably even a suspension
3891499 we have a good senior class that has the potential to lead us through the battles and a great junior class that numbers wise make up the heart of our team
3891500 but we will figure out a way to score goals and win games with her absence but it will have to be a team effort
3891501 it takes a few years for the tumours to develop but there seems to be a good amount of evidence that the radiation that comes from the mobile phone contributes toward the development of brain tumours
3891502 i think we are at this stage in time just seeing the tip of the iceberg
3891503 we would be seeing more patients with small tumours but these are large tumours
3891504 we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry
3891505 theres no good reason why mobile phones should cause brain tumours
3891506 there is no interaction between the radio magnetic field and human tissue
3891507 this is reminiscent of the early days of discussions over whether tobacco was harmful and could it cause cancer as well as the concerns over asbestos and lead in products solid proof is too late when you have malignant tumour
3891508 permatang pauh voters hold the decisive key on the future direction of the country
3891509 anwar is our captain if he falls the pakatan ship will sink
3891510 the panel came up for auction in sothebys and the story the collector gave to us is that he used to put ads in the local newspapers asking for wood and sometime in the 50s he had a response from a farm in monmouthshire
3891511 he remembered taking the ferry across the river severn because this was of course before the severn bridge was built and driving to meet this farmer
3891512 the farmer wanted to show him a bed but just as he was leaving he said i have something in the cow shed that might interest you it was apparently one of the pieces of wood dividing the cow sheds
3891513 the collector gave him a fiver put it in the car and took it home
3891514 extremely good condition for its age and given its unusual history
3891515 the panel shows us that he must have quite radically brought the castle up to date i think its a celebration of him becoming an earl
3891516 it is at the very height of court style for the late 1510s early 1520s it opens our eyes to a phase of history at the castle we were unaware of
3891517 there are a whole host of sex traffickers who specifically prey on children
3891518 they seek out children who may have any sort of vulnerability vulnerability from sexual abuse as a child vulnerability from homelessness vulnerability from all different hosts of issues
3891519 we have a case involving defendant jovon johnson who was just sentenced in june of this year in superior court to 45 1 2 years in prison for sexual assault and sex trafficking type offenses
3891520 this fellow would drive around the district see teenage girls on the street entice them into his car force them to disrobe and perform sex acts hold them captive and then force them into acts of prostitution
3891521 john mccains chief foreign policy adviser and his business partner lobbied the senator or his staff on 49 occasions in a 3 1 2 year span while being paid hundreds of thousands of dollars by the government of the former soviet republic of georgia
3891522 we will try to keep as much of the original as possible
3891523 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
3891524 california is suffering from the same thing everyone else is
3891525 without question americas fire situation has changed its not going to go back
3891526 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3891527 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems
3891528 it really makes little sense to try to upgrade our infrastructure using a revenue source as ineffective unsustainable and unpopular as the fuel tax
3891529 secretary peters plan to overhaul our nations transportation investment strategy begins the much needed transition away from status quo solutions that produce status quo results her plan strengthens the abilities of state and local officials to integrate effective transit and highway solutions to meet americans ever changing travel demands
3891530 its probably undergone multiple remodels you know multiple ceilings multiple roofs trying to track things down and a lot of it was just difficult to try and find where the fire was
3891531 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3891532 we expect russia to honour its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance
3891533 it is not the intention of the united states in some way to take control of facilities port facilities or the like
3891534 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3891535 the time will come to deal with the consequences of what has happened but for now i hope that the russians are going to be true to the word that they spoke which is that theyre going to stop these military operations
3891536 on this trip she will continue our efforts to rally the free world in the defence of a free georgia
3891537 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists the sovereignty and territory of georgia be respected
3891538 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3891539 the cataloging policy and support office has undertaken a project to update all of the inverted headings of the type insurance to natural language forms and to re evaluate the reference structures associated with these headings the revisions will be appearing on weekly lists in batches over the course of the next several weeks existing bibliographic records will be updated shortly after the revised authority records are approved

3891562 all things being equal right now and given the fact that you differ with the president so strongly on this tax cut and on some of these spending issues would you ever consider challenging him for the republican nomination next year
3891563 no no but look the president and i agree on most issues there was a recent study that showed that i voted with the president over 90 percent of the time higher than a lot of my even republican colleagues
3891564 there should also be a united nations mediator to address this crisis and the united states should fully support this effort we should also convene another international forums to condemn this aggression to call for an immediate halt to the violence and to review multilateral and bilateral arrangements with russia including russias interest in joining the world trade organization

3891567 everything was going great until three comics came out each playing
3891568 one was playing heath ledger as the joker and he just kept listing prescription pills he had in his pocket

3891575 esa combinaci n de precios cercanos a un r cord y la excepcionalmente alta volatilidad siempre parece afectar la demanda de joyas

3891577 me asombra continuamente la manera en que los consumidores parecen adaptarse a los altos precios una vez que se estabilizan

3891582 for some more time inflation can increase it could touch 13 per cent but by december it will start declining and is likely to moderate to 8 9 per cent by march 2009
3891583 it inflation could be brought down to 8 9 per cent by march 2009 through co ordinated policy action the tight monetary stance needs to be maintained till the pace of inflation comes down
3891584 there is a slowdown in agriculture industry and services and the global environment is not very conducive to growth this will affect the indian economy as well
3891585 if the pmeac pegs gdp growth at 7 7 per cent i can confidently say it will be close to eight per cent
3891586 unrespectable and would be the second highest growth rate by any country
3891587 one should not forget that there are business cycles and growth cannot move only in one direction
3891588 implementation of the rural employment guarantee programme and sixth pay commissions report we think will take total deficit to 5 per cent this is a very large fiscal deficit
3891589 such remarks are factually wrong and bear no relationship to reality
3891590 to call for international involvement in the sovereign internal affairs of india is gratuitous illegal and only reflects reversion to a mindset that has led to no good consequences for pakistan in the past

3891594 they killed my brother that hurt me some nights i cry
3891595 the big break in this case is that after a year i finally had witnesses that would cooperate and come forward in this case which was a real big deal because the suspect in this case had created a lot of fear in the community
3891596 at the hospital my brother passed on and they gave me the money in his pocket and i knew he couldve paid him 3 and that boy just took hi life for nothing
3891597 fancy is as alluring feminine and romantic as jessica simpson herself her talent charm and values have made her americas sweetheart and have shown her to be the kind of person that women of all ages can admire
3891598 consumers have different mindsets the paris hilton consumer is a little bit older more oriented towards glamour the jessica consumer relates to her image as americas sweetheart the all american girl next door paris evokes more of a hollywood image
3891599 with fancy i wanted to create a pretty fragrance one i could be just as comfortable wearing on the red carpet or every day with my favorite jeans for me fancy is just that fancy this is a special fragrance personal whimsical playful and romantic with a heart of gardenia an essence i truly cherish

3891601 if the prime ministers economic advisory council pegs it economic growth at 7 7 per cent i can confidently say it will be close to eight per cent
3891602 it appears to me that public sector companies are violating the guidelines issued to them by dpe they are continuing to call for bids for bulk deposits and they are not observing the guidelines that 60 per cent of public sector companies money must be kept with public sector banks
3891603 i intend to take up that matter with dpe i intend to take up the issue with the minister concerned
3891604 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3891605 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3891606 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3891607 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3891608 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it posted at 7 40am today
3891609 foreclosures and short sales in the twin cities housing market
3891610 frankly we are getting some significant interest in our asset sales including hummer but probably it wont be concluded imminently

3891613 i was wondering how people on this forum built their net worth
3891614 what youll continue to see over the next few days and next few weeks is more firms entering into settlement agreements with their regulators
3891615 no it doesnt make sense to pay off a loan and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3891616 you have an auto loan at 8 but your car is depreciating so i wouldnt worry about paying that off and have your money tied up in a depreciating asset
3891617 you have credit card debt at 15 but i wouldnt worry about paying it off because you used the card to buy gold coins and they are appreciating so you have a lot of equity there
3891618 i will let you use this for free so long as you give back to the community for the greater good
3891619 here the proposed draft was provided we politely reviewed it said thanks but no thanks and ultimately decided to go another way

3891622 we are not taking a side the governor hopes that the people deserving of medical monitoring receive the medical monitoring that they need
3891623 governor manchin just showed us hes more concerned with big business in west virginia than with the health and well being of our families and children
3891624 maybe governor manchin should come here and try to explain his actions
3891625 just the simplest things bother me allergies a runny nose on a daily basis it worries and bothers me
3891626 might feel different maybe if his own family members were involved
3891627 the governor made his own judgment based on the issues
3891628 and his office wrote and filed their own brief with the west virginia supreme court
3891629 this is a high profile high dollar case so i can imagine that feelings and tempers may be fairly high
3891630 but from our point of view it is not unusual for this governor or other governors to participate in matters that are before the courts that have a direct impact on west virginia it is certainly not indicative of corruption
3891631 if the unit wont power on and the power brick has power and is lit up green the issue is likely a failing voltage regulator transistor the p n of the transistor is mmbt3906lt1 and it can be replaced at home with a small soldiering iron and some care look up the transistor part number there of plenty of location guides and sources to buy it on line they are all of a few dollars

3891634 mr granthams study of bubbles suggests that it takes them about as long to deflate as it did to inflate he says the standard amp poors 500 stock index could fall more than an additional 20 from its current level
3891635 i suspect that 2003 will end up being the fourth consecutive down year for the first time since 1932
3891636 after a huge stock bubble burst the stock market historically has pursued a painful and predictable path this time it hasnt quite followed the script and that is making some stock analysts nervous if mr grantham is right the current rally is a fools paradise the prelude to a deadening decline that he calls the end of the world he says it could begin late this year and stocks could fall even further than in 2002

3891652 if the unit wont power on and the power brick has power and is lit up green the issue is likely a failing voltage regulator transistor the p n of the transistor is mmbt3906lt1 and it can be replaced at home with a small soldiering iron and some care look up the transistor part number there of plenty of location guides and sources to buy it on line they are all of a few dollars
3891653 our negotiators and the americans have almost brought it the accord to a close it is not a closed deal but it is very close
3891654 i think we can defend it yes i would say that it is the most advanced version of a sofa ever that the united states has done with any other country because of the areas of compromises of concessions of understanding
3891655 this is not a recolonisation as some of our critics say or another anglo iraqi treaty of the 1930s that will bind iraq
3891656 have managed to make some compromises on all the sticky issues or problematic areas of any sofa which are universal jurisdiction detention powers of authorisation to launch military operations issues of sovereignty
3891657 we are talking about combat troops maybe in 2010 11 there could be drawdowns
3891658 the idea is really to keep these forces outside the main cities the population centres it doesnt mean that they could not enter or come through

3891663 when the low byte of a 16 bit register is read by the cpu the high byte of the 16 bit register is copied into the temporary register in the same clock cycle as the low byte is read
3891664 what one can say is that for people with chronic stable coronary disease pci can be deferred
3891665 they can continue on medication aimed at their specific risk factors hypertension lipid disorders diabetes and should be encouraged to have a good lifestyle with exercise smoking cessation and weight control
3891666 if people say my pain is so bad i cant function that is one thing
3891667 if people say i have angina but im doing ok thats another
3891668 pci adds about 10 000 without any significant gain in years of survival or quality of life
3891669 but when a doctor talks to a patient the doctor is an advocate for that patient
3891670 paying the cost out of pocket gives one a different point of view
3891671 until that category is changed the effect of this study will be modest
3891672 we have justified angioplasty for years by saying it is of great benefit to patients
3891673 this study shows no survival benefit and shows that the benefit in regard to symptom relief is temporary medical therapy should be considered for all patients with stable angina unless they have severe pain when diagnosed
3891674 im in my final year at college and im working too hard to have time for a boyfriend but i love to have fun
3891675 donors who died from cardiocirculatory causes offer an opportunity to reduce waiting time and waiting list mortality among children whose survival depends on a heart transplant
3891676 i dont know how you can ever have a patient that meets the criteria for irreversible loss of function and then reverse that function in someone else
3891677 if death means irreversible loss of cardiac function and that heart beats in someone elses chest its not irreversible is it
3891678 with such consent there is no harm or wrong done in retrieving vital organs before death providing that anesthesia is administered with proper safeguards no patient will die from vital organ donation who would not otherwise die as a result of the withdrawal of life support
3891679 tibolone which is used around the world for menopausal symptoms decreases the risk of fractures decreases the risk of breast cancer but increases the risk of stroke in this group of women who are all over the age of 60
3891680 for older women you should stop taking tibolone or not consider starting it
3891681 women who are having menopausal symptoms in their 50s can continue to take tibolone because it is relatively safe and also does have other benefits such as a reduction in the risk of fracture and breast cancer
3891682 it will not be available in the united states because the company is not asking the u s food and drug administration to approve it
3891683 all drugs that are being used for menopausal symptoms all have positives and negatives the task is to find drugs that dont have problems
3891684 we used to think air pollution was a problem that primarily affects the lungs we now know it is also bad for the heart

3891689 children of this age are basically curious and thats why cyber safety is failing
3891690 we talk about educating children about the internet but i think the department needs to educate their teachers on cyber safety and whats appropriate for a teacher to share online
3891691 if adults or siblings are giving our children access to facebook then it is a concern more widely
3891692 the school has taken appropriate action to ensure its teachers exercise discretion when posting material on sites such as facebook
3891693 if the player looses he should at least know why and learn from it
3891694 it seems that there is this subconscious need to see what they are shooting at

3891716 hoewel een verhaal over de opbouw van zijn immense imperium ook zeer interessant zou zijn wilde ik me in deze film vooral concentreren op de reis die temudjin geboortenaam van khan red aflegt van kleine jongen die al vroeg van zijn ouders wordt gescheiden tot een legeraanvoerder die het mongoolse volk wist te verenigen en een groot deel van de wereld veroverde
3891717 de russen schuiven alle problemen die ze hebben zelfs nu nog af op de 250 jaar durende mongoolse overheersing en leren hun kinderen op school dat hij een brute maniak was die miljoenen russen uitmoordde
3891718 het mongoolse leger was veel kleiner dan het russische maar door de zeer moderne militaire strategie n die zelfs nu nog gebruikt worden konden zij de russen verslaan de mongoolse overheersing had niet alleen negatieve gevolgen voor de russen zo hebben de mongolen een grote positieve invloed gehad op de russische cultuur en is het aan hen te danken dat rusland nu n verenigd land is
3891719 khan was niet alleen een van de beste militairen uit de geschiedenis hij was ook een zeer interessant mens voor een legendarische leider van zijn statuur is zijn tolerantie tegenover andere religies zeer bijzonder hij beoordeelde de mensen om hem heen niet op het geloof dat ze aanhingen maar om hun betrouwbaarheid ook zijn generositeit tegenover zijn soldaten was tamelijk uniek hij nam slechts tien procent van de gehele winst in beslag en verdeelde de rest onder zijn soldaten hierdoor wisten de soldaten dat er goed voor hen werd gezorgd en kwamen ze minder snel in opstand
3891720 objectieve informatie over genghis khan is vrijwel niet te vinden omdat hij eeuwen geleden leefde in een tijd dat informatie op mondelinge wijze werd verspreid daarnaast is informatie over hem ook erg afhankelijk van de tijd en plaats waar je het zoekt
3891721 ik heb met behulp van vele historici zo veel mogelijk informatie over hem proberen te verzamelen die we vervolgens zijn gaan analyseren alles wat geschreven is onder het sovjetregime is moeilijk te vertrouwen en voor het verhaal over zijn jeugd moesten we afgaan op n mongools heldendicht genaamd de geheime geschiedenis van de mongolen van dat gedicht is het origineel ook nog eens verloren geraakt waardoor de verschillende vertaalde versies ervan ook niet volledig te vertrouwen zijn
3891722 er is weinig bewijs voor dat khan een deel van zijn leven in de gevangenis heeft doorgebracht zoals ik in de film laat zien de mongolen willen niet geloven dat de man die ze als een god beschouwen in de gevangenis heeft gezeten maar ik moest een manier vinden om invulling te geven aan deze tien jaar van zijn leven die in de geschiedenisboeken niet zijn terug te vinden er zijn historici die mijn visie ondersteunen maar de kans is zeker aanwezig dat er een andere verklaring voor zijn tienjarige verdwijning is
3891723 mijn film is wel even groots in aanpak als die amerikaanse producties maar er zijn toch wel grote verschillen het belangrijkste is dat het budget voor deze film vele malen lager lag
3891724 his face told me he was so proud of himself
3891725 this generation of kids seems to be hard wired for environmental awareness
3891726 kids have been making the connection between the environment and a vegetarian diet and knowing that going vegetarian is the best thing that you can do for the environment
3891727 kids should learn at a young age to recycle and take care of the environment
3891728 we want to train kids to be activists through our programs
3891729 students can decorate their dorms with items purchased from goodwill vintage shops and the online classified site craigslist and many schools have recycling programs whereby items kids didnt take home with them last year are available to students for this school year like chairs and appliances
3891730 you dont have to bring a microwave and refrigerator as these are usually available in the common area so are tvs and dvd players
3891731 its all about using less energy and if you do have your own appliances keep them on power save mode
3891732 its not always easy for a college student to afford eco friendly items and its hard to find them even if they are affordable so i do what i can
3891733 its really a matter of changing habits in ways that dont cost much for instance i use as little water as possible when taking a shower or washing dishes i never buy plastic water bottles and instead have a reusable aluminum bottle and fill it with tap water i have reusable canvas bags for shopping and i try to rely on my bike for transportation
3891734 the less packaging the better so we reduce the amount of plastics being used and trash
3891735 its really about a student lifestyle change and habits that can be a challenge at first but ultimately arent difficult to adopt
3891736 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3891737 he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3891738 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away

3891748 because for example we know in housing needs in remote areas we have a couple of billion dollars in remote housing requirements
3891749 in this country we have skills shortages and we have a changing demographic and telstra will do all it can to retain our staff and to provide the best incentives it can to ensure that we have the workforce we need going forward
3891750 this is an agenda which is about dividing the workforce not providing all the facts to the workforce
3891751 it the nationals hasnt been associated with any ccc corruption and crime commission derogatory findings
3891752 they need to be accountable and im going to make them accountable one way or another
3891753 they dont have any answer to this virus this is the only living animal ever thats beat the virus
3891754 based on medical advice it was too big a risk for people that would be looking after the horse
3891755 an inspector will be directed to carry out the order on friday
3891756 i dont think were really looking at taking any action against mr small and i need to emphasise that mr small has actually done nothing wrong
3891757 the horse is a victim of unfortunate circumstances here but it does present a risk and our priority is to remove that risk
3891758 at the end of the day hes pretty irrelevant and it will show in history that he wasnt a particularly good premier
3891759 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3891760 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3891761 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3891762 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3891763 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3891764 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3891765 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3891766 well beyond anything that is needed to protect russian peacekeepers
3891767 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3891768 the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3891769 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
3891770 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3891771 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3891772 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3891773 its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3891774 there is no more fire season as we know it the fire season is now all year round
3891775 california is suffering from the same thing everyone else is
3891776 without question americas fire situation has changed its not going to go back

3891782 after decades and decades of wild nights we hear hef is calling it a day and that playboy enterprises has decided that this party and the upcoming annual halloween party will be the last that the magazine mogul personally throws as a means to cut costs
3891783 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3891784 bob told me today that manny has declined to the accept the terms
3891785 i had a nice conversation with bob well move on and i guess manny will move on
3891786 on the three sticking points oscar gave in on 2 of them you could say
3891787 richard and i had a good meeting and we resolved the other issues
3891788 oscar wanted 70 30 and richard and i figured that there would be room for movement oscar was supposed to come in to los angeles this week to meet with richard in person but he didnt make it and had to do it on the telephone oscar was adamant about it being 70 30 or no deal richard told me that and that i transmitted it to pacquiao and his people in the philippines they told me that there was no deal and to look to make another fight
3891789 richard and i had a very frank discussion i always felt there would be a deal when richard came back and said that oscar wasnt moving i was surprised unless there is movement the deal is off
3891790 i think what it will take is for manny to give and for oscar to give to get a deal done
3891791 the question in a fighters mind is not how much theyre going to make but what is a fair split
3891792 forget the ultimate number they have to perceive what they are getting is fair the deal we were working on was a lot of money for both guys the question is what is a fair split i thought somewhere between 30 and 40 percent for manny was fair
3891793 it is a bit mind boggling for me that he would have to fight three or four times to make what he could make to fight oscar
3891794 i hope manny has been given all the information by his people
3891795 you dont start a negotiations offering 30 percent and adamantly take the position that youre not going to move he should have said that in the beginning its not richard its oscar he says manny shouldnt get more than floyd mayweather floyd got 30 percent manny says hes bigger than floyd was at the time
3891796 if they called us and proposed 35 percent i would go and i would be able to get the fight done
3891797 i hope that oscar with all his money and everything is going to be sensible here
3891798 its just a letter why i feel i should be reinstated its my chance to respond and well see how it goes
3891799 adam is aware of the things that need to be done in order to take the next step
3891800 thats at goodells discretion and i dont want to do or say anything that would imply that im getting anxious or pushy about it
3891801 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner
3891802 jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the nfl and the cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement
3891803 the important thing is getting him here and getting him acclimated
3891804 i have told him you are a good kid we know you and were looking forward to having you on the team and were excited about you proving everybody wrong
3891805 were just doing everything we can do to have an uneventful training camp relative to adam and hes doing his part
3891806 hes working his tail off hes making it that way
3891807 if pacman can come out and help us here great

3891814 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was
3891815 no estamos en 1968 en la invasi n de checoslovaquia cuando rusia pod a invadir a un pa s vecino ocupar una capital derrocar a un gobierno y marcharse las cosas han cambiado
3891816 ha llegado el momento de que el presidente ruso haga honor a su palabra
3891817 si rusia est violando el alto el fuego y tengo informes que no son muy alentadores al respecto entonces esto servir para profundizar el aislamiento internacional en el que rusia se est moviendo
3891818 lo mejor ahora es dejar en manos de los franceses los esfuerzos de mediaci n
3891819 ha dejado muy claro que apoya al gobierno democr ticamente elegido de georgia
3891820 esto podr a haber sido resuelto dentro de unos l mites
3891821 pero lo que ha hecho rusia va m s all de todo eso y al prolongar el conflicto las reas inocentes en georgia est n en peligro
3891822 que rusia puede usar su impresionante poder militar en la regi n contra un peque o pa s vecino es obvio que rusia puede hacer eso sin consecuencias o que lo lleven hasta tal punto de destruir al estado georgiano eso creo que es algo diferente rusia no puede tener xito en eso
3891823 quiz no ha aceptado que es hora de avanzar y dejar atr s la guerra fr a

3891827 i have never in my life smelled anything like that
3891828 she told me they had a mother and four kids and apparently theyve been kept at home and there was some abuse allegations and the dad wouldnt let them leave
3891829 i have never in my life smelled anything like that

3891836 we have to revive a culture of innovation and repair

3891838 sorry but for most of them it is too late
3891839 basically the goal is to create a star trek style replicator in 20 years
3891840 the fab labs tap into this wellspring of interest from ordinary people in getting the means to create their own technology
3891841 i couldnt understand why an interest in making things was taken as a sign of lesser intelligence
3891842 i didnt want to go in the life raft he made me go he had my gun
3891843 that i would get shot he had just shot four people
3891844 that would be a normal coast guard procedure and not a nefarious underhanded attempt by the coast guard to obtain criminal information
3891845 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3891846 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3891847 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3891848 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3891849 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3891850 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3891851 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3891852 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3891853 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3891854 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3891855 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3891856 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3891857 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3891858 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3891859 the timing really is good with us celebrating our 60th year of racing next year
3891860 although its not on labor day it is a 500 mile race at darlington
3891861 and thats another way of our continuing to tie back into our history and our tradition
3891862 when i think of darlington and the history of the track the southern 500 is what comes to mind
3891863 i look forward to the opportunity of possibly winning a sixth
3891864 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3891865 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3891866 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3891867 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3891868 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that

3891870 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3891871 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3891872 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited

3891875 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3891876 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is

3891885 it captures the desperation and the anger that many officers now feel
3891886 you should be aware of your rights so as to ensure you secure your full entitlements as well as being aware of the obligatons of your chief officer and police authority under those regulations and determinations
3891887 our members together with chief officers and police authorities are expected to comply with their obligations under the police regulations and determinations this is particularly so when police officers are dissatisfied with the way we are being treated by the government
3891888 public safety and national security are key priorities for us and should always be put first we know that the police share our determination to do this
3891889 the bank can swap the stock of assets from illiquid to liquid form it cant provide funding to finance investment that has to come from mobilising savings in the economy thats what the financial sector is there to do
3891890 it would be a very dangerous move to have a situation where the government saw its major role as guaranteeing lending
3891891 why should the taxpayer take on the risk of borrowing by individual borrowers some of whom are risky its the lenders who should take the risk
3891892 we dont guarantee lending to other forms of borrowing there is no reason why in the long run you need any guarantee of lending to the mortgage market
3891893 that we havent seen play out yet so we have to go through that process
3891894 new york gave me my words and my music and rock n roll gave me a place for that music to live

3891910 most of the proponents of the nexus legislation would concede that given this is an election year its unlikely the legislation will pass
3891911 the way our statute is currently we probably could tax them but we should probably have the legislature have the final say
3891912 the user can choose how much information to share thats a really big deal
3891913 we think there are a number of ways that we think the fire eagle platform is good for yahoos business and advertising is certainly one of them

3891920 the eternals are essentially god like and their powers trump anyone in the marvel universe
3891921 theyre in another league its like dropping mike tyson into a schoolyard brawl it can be amusing but not too conducive to suspense or drama i mean the outcome isnt much of a mystery
3891922 so we have to be careful they pop in advise and lend an occasional hand but never really drive this marvel universe story arc
3891923 in a way starks closest analogues are the celestials themselves in that they are creatures contained within armor
3891924 the difference i think is that starks armor enhances his strength and power whereas the celestials armor contains and channels it
3891925 the horde is a cosmic threat its like a bunch of red ants are taking over the nest of some black ants pretty dramatic until you realize the ant hill is located in a park in hiroshima and the date is august 6 1945 doesnt matter much who wins
3891926 the fact that the eternals are in disarray does create an opportunity for the skrulls
3891927 normally the invasion would be front row center for the eternals

3891939 this research is especially important because it opens new avenues for exploration of autoimmune disease that embrace the concepts of protein complementarity
3891940 the power of this approach has gone unappreciated even though the basic ideas of protein complementarity have been proven in other settings over the years
3891941 using an antibody reactive with complementary pr3 protein produced in the laboratory we analyzed protein pools removed from the patients plasma during plasma exchange therapy to identify any existing proteins that were reactive with the anti complementary pr3 antibody
3891942 identification of potentially pathogenic disease causing anti plasminogen antibodies provides an explanation of why patients with pr3 anca disease have a high incidence of blood clots
3891943 what is needed is a clinical test that is specific and precise enough to measure anti plasminogen antibody levels
3891944 hopefully our discoveries will entice scientists to consider the potential implications of protein complementarity
3891945 democrats are trying to get people to stop using fossil fuels
3891946 the best thing about brooklyn college is its diversity we have such a rich array of students we have so many different courses and majors we get to interact with people from so many different backgrounds with different experiences and ways of thinking
3891947 whether youre an adult working student or a student whose family has never gone to college youll find that youll have the proper orientation available youll be able to interact with a diverse group of students and have the opportunity to use what you learn in the classroom in internships organizations on campus and projects and activities outside the classroom
3891948 a unique aspect of bryn mawr is the honor code it is an unwritten feature of the school that creates a competitive environment but grades arent really spoken about which keeps people competitive with themselves yet not other people you try to be your best without beating on someone else
3891949 city college has provided me access to a fantastic education and rich campus experience through its excellent academic programs its diverse faculty and student body and location in the worlds greatest city i have been given the chance to discover who i am and what i want from life
3891950 city college students are intensely stimulating intellectually challenging and alive their life experiences together with their city college education gird them uniquely to lead this generation
3891951 im doing things i never thought would be possible as an undergrad im working with an adviser who is absolutely phenomenal im going to sudan to do research there are just a lot of opportunities we have here that i dont think you can get other places i love bucnkell thats what it comes down to
3891952 it provides a wide variety of engaging academic programs taught by faculty committed to undergraduate education and scholarly pursuits the residential learning environment provides growth and development opportunities both in and outside the classroom students are also attracted to the strong sense of community
3891953 i would say that butler is the perfect medium a big school with division i sports and plenty of opportunities and majors but small enough that you can know your own professors i visited a lot of small schools and i came from a small high school and i wanted to be able to develop relationships with my professors but i didnt want to be limited in terms of opportunities that was a big thing for me and butler was that happy medium
3891954 people like the fact that were a medium sized school the average class has 20 people in it but they can still go to a basketball game with 10 000 people our facilities match up with those of larger places but the professors still know the students and together that makes for an incredibly valuable experience
3891955 so many people knew about it there was so much information out there it just took one break to break the case open
3891956 we fed off a lot of what he gave us it just took a lot of leg work to follow up
3891957 once something goes into the water the decomposition is pretty intense
3891958 we had to take the pluff mud out and examine it as it was coming out and make sure no other evidentiary items were left in the mud
3891959 it wasnt exactly a drug deal gone bad it was more premeditated than that
3891960 prospects for h con res 362 and s res 580
3891961 as you know your boss is a cosponsor of s res 580 while we are working with leadership and sfrc to move the bill we are aware that it has several fixes that need to be made among them are two that we need your boss ok on before proceeding
3891962 like a ray of light penetrates glass without destroying it mary became a mother without losing her virginity
3891963 we didnt give up and were not gonna give up until we get our answers
3891964 we dont think its right to use the word as a joke as a way to provoke humor
3891965 what were trying to do is educate people on why this is so hurtful we hope people understand why this language is hurtful
3891966 i think its rude to people who have disabilities too
3891967 they are so huge i thought they may make someone a nice shawl or even better something for halloween perhaps

3891971 he lost control and he did have a piece of wood in his hand unfortunately he did strike one of our property staff who also works as a part time security person in our college
3891972 we do have a teachers aide with him fulltime when he is on site
3891973 he has been back but he is not completely over it yet
3891974 these things will happen we have got 40 special needs young people in our college
3891975 a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted by his call for a new era
3891976 john mccains was very bellicose it was calling to kick russia out of the g 8 ignoring all the strategic interests we have with russia
3891977 what we dont see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want be anything they can be
3891978 freedom is about authority freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do
3891979 what we dont see is that freedom is not a concept in which people can do anything they want be anything they can be
3891980 freedom is about authority freedom is about the willingness of every single human being to cede to lawful authority a great deal of discretion about what you do
3891981 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia
3891982 and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3891983 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3891984 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten its neighbors occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it things have changed
3891985 there are concerning reports from around georgia that russia has not in fact in accordance with the pledge that it took to the french presidency to president sarkozy that russia has not ended its military operations those operations must stop and must stop now
3891986 it is important to think again about whether in fact russia will be committed to the kind of behavior that would make its involvement in those institutions appropriate
3891987 the capabilities of the president to communicate with his team exists wherever he goes but there is a benefit to face to face communication and so the president just wanted one more day to be with his team
3891988 do not adhere to the principles and values of the sacramento kings organization
3891989 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
3891990 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3891991 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back

3891993 lo m s importante de las 26 leyes aprobadas es la incorporaci n del pueblo
3891994 yo creo que uno de los factores m s importantes que tienen las 26 leyes aprobadas por v a habilitante es la incorporaci n del pueblo la participaci n del poder popular activamente en una relaci n de corresponsabilidad entre el poder central y regional
3891995 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3891996 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3891997 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama

3891999 i would love to see more latinas i think they are coming weve got to be patient but soon they will be here
3892000 there are so many koreans but we have to follow their example because they are doing things very well
3892001 i believe that good examples are very important so others are motivated and i hope the same can happen in mexico and latin america
3892002 i am here because i want to break records the most important thing for me is to stay as the worlds number one
3892003 the issue is not whether mining should be undertaken or not rather it is about how it should be undertaken it is about ensuring that mining is conducted in an environmentally and socially acceptable manner
3892004 i think it will hold from the georgian point of view and i think the russians have reached as far as they wish to anyway
3892005 so i would hope and think that it is likely that with one or two perhaps smaller exceptions and micro conflicts that might emerge i think broadly the cease fire is likely to hold
3892006 the georgians are very keen on having a genuine international peacekeeping force perhaps administered by the osce or the u n or maybe the eu the russians are adamant that that peacekeeping force should have a very significant russian contingent and that is where the sticking point will come
3892007 i would say he gambled and it was not an unreasonable gamble that this would be a fait accompli that it would be over within hours a day or two at the most and that russia would be caught on its heels and effectively the matter could be dealt with and south ossetia could be re integrated back into georgia proper
3892008 i think the russian motives were pretty clear fabricate a fight with georgia give a humiliating beating to the georgians put their opposition to russia into a box try to get regime change show the world that the big power is back as a big power
3892009 this report shows that things dont seem to be getting better
3892010 and in fact in terms of the actual numbers they seem to be getting worse
3892011 what is required is a new human order of true men and women who will live reality and never turn away
3892012 roy kramer was in tennessees back pocket blah blah blah
3892013 he looks very good and he can hit the ball with a lot of power it is something when you see an 18 year old hitting the ball out of a major league ballpark the other way he did it here and hit it out toward right center he has strong hands and a natural whip in his swing that is hard to teach he will continue to improve and i think he is going to be just fine
3892014 if you look at his numbers right now they are not probably that great but the adjustments he has made from last year are unbelievable he is a totally different hitter he already has a few home runs where last year he was more a contact hitter now he is hitting the ball with authority and is much stronger it is hard to make that adjustment in one year so i have been really impressed to see that progress
3892015 he is another player with a bright future but he needs to play he is only 18 years old and last year he didnt play much as he had an injury so basically this is his first year his arm strength and speed are above average he can go get the ball in the outfield and when he makes contact he can hit the ball way out of the ballpark so we know out of the five tools he has four of them now we are just working on his hitting as he needs to be more consistent he needs to make more contact and put up more quality at bats which could come as he matures he really has a bright future and the potential to be an everyday player in the big leagues he reminds me of andre dawson
3892016 he had a shoulder problem throughout all of spring training and extended spring he just got back a few days ago and we are taking him slowly he looks very good but he lost so much time
3892017 his fastball sits between 88 93 mph he is just a real athletic kid throws good strikes with his fastball and is just trying to develop his secondary pitches right now he has a good feel for a changeup and we are trying to figure out if he will throw a curveball or slider whichever fits well with him he is a former shortstop and moves around well and he should be able to make adjustments pretty easily because he is such a good athlete
3892018 his curveball and changeup are so far advanced for any kid his age he is basically a high school senior and just turned 19 so would be going into his freshman year in college you just dont see that at such an early age he has an ability to throw his curveball for strikes and is a big league breaking ball a weapon his changeup is very similar to that too he is a very loose bodied kid and has a good frame that should fill out his arm works so easy so with maturity he is going to add velocity when you add velocity to the secondary pitches he has you have a big time starting pitching prospect
3892019 he just turned 18 you know what this kid is probably one of the most mature kids we have in that locker room which says a lot for a 17 18 year old kid coming into this environment he has handled himself nothing but professionally and is ready to work everyday he pretty much had a good delivery when he got here so it is more about educating him on taking care of himself learning how to attack hitters and just kind of acclimating him to professional baseball
3892020 really all through extended spring he has probably been the most consistent guy here from the beginning until now he has made improvements he is a guy who throws three pitches for strikes and really trusts his fastball he is not scared of contact and i think eventually he will be more of a groundball type pitcher i wouldnt say he is like an aaron laffey because he has a different fastball and stuff but i think he has a chance to be one
3892021 he is 100 healthy he has made a lot of improvements and he is still trying to acclimate to professional baseball as even though he was here last year it was not very long he is now learning that it is more than just showing up on the day you pitch and that there is work that goes in between those five days he is around 87 90 mph with the fastball and throws a curveball and changeup where the curveball is very good
3892022 he is around 90 92 mph and is a big physical kid with a nice loose arm he had a big year in college going 17 1 or something like that and had a big increase in his workload where i think he had around 130 innings before coming out here so we are just kind of limiting his workload i think we will be able to get a better feel for him next year getting him out to a full season team who knows if he is going to start or be in a reliever role i dont think it matters he is an interesting kid because he is a big big guy with some arm strength and looks like he has a good slider and changeup i think the slider has the potential to be a major league slider
3892023 he is what we call a pure development guy where he has a lot of arm strength is very inconsistent with his strike throwing will show you anywhere up to 95 mph and does have a lot of secondary stuff it is one of those things where it is patience and consistent work with him i almost want the kid to back off a little bit with the velocity so he can get a better feel for the strike zone once he learns how to command the ball with a little less velocity then it is easier to add the arm speed back
3892024 it is a whole lot more games than in high school as i think i passed the amount of games i played in high school the first two weeks out here but it is pretty cool to live on your own and stuff i think the weirdest part was when you wake up in the morning you are like aw i gotta go to school oh wait no i dont i just go to the ballpark now and have fun and play baseball
3892025 in high school you see maybe one guy who throws 90 mph but out here everybody throws 90 mph i am learning from the coaches here and they are helping me out to make my job easier so i can perform i am working on staying with a steadier approach and trying not to swing at balls out of the zone i am still learning the zone as a young hitter and i am just trying to stay consistent as much as i can with my plan at the plate
3892026 i live in kind of a small area so a lot of scouts dont get around there for colleges and stuff
3892027 also my senior year in high school was my first year playing baseball full time i was going to go to a junior college but then i got offered a contract and my family felt it was a good decision so i made up my mind to play pro ball
3892028 my instincts in the outfield are getting a lot better and my adjustment from center field to right field has gone well
3892029 i am enjoying it down here and just loving it and i am pretty satisfied with what i have done so far
3892030 there are a few things i need to work on mechanically like just being more efficient with my pitches and making more strike pitches
3892031 ive been cheering for the vancouver canucks for how long and they still have never won a stanley cup
3892032 i still love them and i hope canadians can still think of us the same way
3892033 dont give up on us the games are not over
3892034 were still here there are still a lot of events the medals are going to come and we want medals too were all ready for medals as well
3892035 the bottom line is alex knows what to do when the whistle blows arturo was affected by nerves
3892036 you could see he lacked in stability and that threw their timing off
3892037 you know we used to have a little joke the little joke was we always hoped that alex felt just a little bit sick
3892038 i think were disappointed because we had some dreams or expectation and it seemed that it was going to be easy but you can see nothings ever easy
3892039 theres much more than just medals but medals is what shows on the books
3892040 i think were there and the canadian olympic committee is there too
3892041 but the rest of the world is moving and the rest of the world is giving major support i think its more than just money but its also creating an environment i think the environment is becoming what we want it to be and weve just got to keep going for it
3892042 les quatre plus beaux spots de vos vacances pass es
3892043 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
3892044 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it
3892045 and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off
3892046 i dont think i am beautiful i can look good and i can look ugly whats funny is that when i was younger i wanted everyone to look at me now i like to watch other people because you can learn a lot of interesting things
3892047 tom cruise and katie holmes to team up on the big screen in food fight
3892048 ill appreciate it if they did it again this weekend but i realise its not going to be an easy task with the boks

3892050 over the last several tests weve played theres only been a certain amount of launches off scrums and lineouts kicking is a big part of it i cant see too much changing
3892051 it might be the way they are going to structure their game plan

3892053 while weve been favoring a dollar rebound in our view this has come a little bit too far too fast there are still significant headwinds for the u s economy and therefore some headwinds for the dollar
3892054 theres been a sell off in the yen crosses it has weighed on the euro and its certainly weighed on sterling
3892055 the upcoming goals are the all around and individual apparatus competitions
3892056 after winning the team gold medal i can relax and actively prepare for what comes next
3892057 see i have written your name on the palms of my hands always in my mind is a picture of jerusalems walls in ruins is 49 16

3892063 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
3892064 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off

3892085 it was always in the watkins family and they owned a sawmill that was where the board of education office is now and every piece of wood from the sawmill went into this house

3892087 one along main street which will be primarily commercial structures but which will extend towards the college and also include some residential structures as well and a second one would be on south kanawha street which is primarily residential
3892088 the building was built in 1884 it was built as a hotel my grandparents bought it in 1942 so its been in the family since 1942
3892089 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
3892090 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
3892091 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
3892092 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3892093 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time
3892094 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3892095 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3892096 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3892097 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3892098 he is not from another planet he is from the future
3892099 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3892100 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win

3892104 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
3892105 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
3892106 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
3892107 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
3892108 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
3892109 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
3892110 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
3892111 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
3892112 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
3892113 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays

3892116 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
3892117 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
3892118 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
3892119 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
3892120 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
3892121 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
3892122 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now

3892127 the first time i was treated by a chiropractor was akin to a miracle a much better option than simply using conventional medicine because my injuries healed faster and my whole body felt better

3892129 chiropractic fulfills a niche need not only by treating injuries but also by aiding in recovery and positively impacting athletic performance
3892130 chiropractors promote active care and treatment with a commitment to healthy progression and rehabilitation
3892131 im delighted to see that the programs are doing so well in what is an increasingly competitive market

3892173 like mufgs initial proposal of 58 00 per share in cash the proposed tender offer of 63 00 per share in cash substantially undervalues unionbancal

3892205 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver that pregnancy
3892206 the evidence regarding the relative mental health risks associated with multiple abortions is more uncertain
3892207 across studies prior mental health emerged as the strongest predictor of post abortion mental health many of these same factors also predict negative psychological reactions to other types of stressful life events including childbirth

3892296 parenting karma has come back to haunt me and at least one person i know finds this very amusing my sister in law
3892297 theyre making a big mistake that will cause them problems down the track
3892298 i dont think anyone out there thought he hit it if that had been for a gold medal i would have been protesting
3892299 id hate to think that but you get the feeling out there when someone clearly misses all the shooters out there can tell if he missed or hit it mark said the judges may have been influenced by the boisterous crowd of 10 000 that cheered the chinese shooter on
3892300 the crowd were yelling and calling shots in and out
3892301 it was like a circus out there it would have been a brave chinese judge that would have put his hand up to signify a miss
3892302 i thought they were very generous to the chinese lad you expect a slight bias but you come to the olympic games and you also expect a level playing field
3892303 in the steel business big is beautiful we have to go in terms of size to enjoy economies of scale by combining the resources of both companies we can negotiate better buying terms
3892304 there is no intention to delist it from the exchange and there will be no major changes in the management as well
3892305 there is huge demand from massive infrastructure projects in china india and other emerging nations
3892306 for the construction sector major developments such as the integrated resorts hotel projects and also government spending in this sector will remain substantially high with additional mrt lines coming up
3892307 money will not be a prohibitive factor in providing the support and necessary resources for tao li to reach her full potential
3892308 its about providing all the resources necessary to realise her full potential with the 2012 olympics as the target
3892309 the ssc will work closely with her on how to map and implement an smss programme to help her stayinjury free
3892310 the ssc have been very supportive and im very grateful that they will continue to be
3892311 he knows my condition very well and he was with us at the 2006 asian games where he helped me get conditioned for my 50m fly race
3892312 after the first two days of racing at the beijing olympics my body was fatigued but he wasnt around so it would be great if hes with me for the next four years id also like more opportunities to train and compete overseas over the next four years
3892313 the government has said that the construction industry will be one of the sectors that will remain buoyant but for small timers like its getting increasingly difficult to remain in business
3892314 i realised that without a university degree i couldnt have risen beyond the rank of major in the army and it would have taken my lifetime to earn a million the car business lacked honesty i had to extol the virtues of a car even after it had been badly bashed up in an accident so i joined my brother
3892315 we did reasonably well for a while and even won a few awards for the quality of our conservation projects despite the currency crisis of 1997 blueprint remained profitable up to 2001
3892316 i tried getting my 33 year old civilengineer from nanyang technological university to take over he wants to make money but doesnt want to bear the risk
3892317 it was getting too tough to keep pace with the rising cost of building materials
3892318 for example sand because of an embargo by the indonesian government shot up from 14 per tonne in 2006 to 60 per tonne in 2007 and now hovers at 40 per tonne construction steel was 800 per tonne in 2006 1 100 in 2007 and 1 800 this year
3892319 i dont think my daughter is suited for the rough life of a contractor and i dont think my son would be interested in the business
3892320 between 1997 and the end of 2006 many construction companies both big and small have folded suffering severe losses
3892321 i am reassured after our talks that there will be more people going through the pavilions
3892322 we will be in contact with the sponsors and i hope they will be satisfied
3892323 in the 1980s the tibetan mastiff was facing extinction with only about 100 left in the world
3892324 now thanks to the efforts of the breeds lovers in china and elsewhere there are more tibetan mastiffs than before
3892325 the tibetan mastiff is absolutely loyal to its owner and will fight for the owners safety with its life
3892326 they represent the characteristics of the chinese people and are a symbol of chinese culture
3892327 they are a rival we have to be careful with
3892328 russia will be a pariah it is a pariah its difficult to do anything other than reduce your exposure said mr ian hague the new york based founding partner of firebird management after returning from tbilisi the georgian capital
3892329 we are harnessing technology that enables us to be anywhere and be live from anywhere
3892330 technology is allowing us to pare down to that one person who can deliver the product
3892331 given how much more splintered the audience is and the different ways that you all are getting your news its hard to have the same infrastructure that we had 25 years ago
3892332 daddy can we give this to help those little kids
3892333 i accepted it and sent the cash equivalent to a doctor friend who was serving in ethiopia tiger doesnt know it but i still have those gold coins one day when the time is right ill give them back to him and recall that moment which brought ears to my eyes
3892334 the love of christ compells us because we judge thus that if one died for all then all died and he died for all that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for him who died for them and rose again
3892335 the operating environment has proven to be difficult with the global economic slowdown rising inflation and high oil prices
3892336 we will remain vigilant and will act on opportunities for growth when they present themselves
3892337 i didnt really perform up to expectations at the olympics i just wanted to get on with life after the games and then this happened
3892338 i cant say for sure if ill be at the next olympics due to my age it also depends on whether project 0812 wants me to continue
3892339 so i just talk and talk and talk and that is how i picked up english here
3892340 i also learnt a little mandarin and hokkien from my friends but the only hokkien example i can give you is ho sei bo or how are you doing because i do not think you can print all the other words i learnt
3892341 it is still scary sometimes when i am on the field and i worry it might go again because when it happens i am out on the sidelines for three weeks and i cannot even join in training
3892342 it is not easy when you drop it is very fast and to climb back up to that level again is a very hard and slow process
3892343 after his first year other clubs started putting him under much tighter marking
3892344 sometimes a barren stretch can get to a striker so we try to encourage him rather than to put pressure on him laakkad has great attitude and is very well liked in the club hes been working hard in training and in matches so its just a question of time before he starts scoring again
3892345 the formation is just numbers but what we saw in euro 2008 shows that the lines between defenders midfielders and forwards are being blurred
3892346 in many cases of teams employing the 4 2 3 1 the lines almost dont exist any more
3892347 midfielders will have a lot of freedom with the 4 2 3 1 with much less hugging of the touch lines and such
3892348 in fact inside runs with position interchanges seem to be the way forward
3892349 for the system of interchanging positions to work players need skill and athleticism and there must be a lot of off the ball movement understanding and discipline
3892350 football knowledge in particular comes into focus every footballer must be a complete player
3892351 that is why i dont think it will feature very much in the epl manchester united have the players for the 4 2 3 1 but not all the clubs will have creative players to follow suit
3892352 im going far away i want you to treat wenjun as your own daughter and help her do her very best
3892353 i told her the olympics is the best chance she has of finding her father
3892354 i told her if you give up you will disappoint your father but if you win the gold medal your father is likely to find you
3892355 ill do well in the games and my dad will see me and be proud
3892356 the last time i saw her she said her greatest dream was to win our country a gold medal
3892357 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur

3892360 we have been growing our pre paid business very aggressively over the past year as the number of customers has grown we have augmented the cell sites where these customers are located to minimise the congestion
3892361 there will always be spot areas where people congregate that will cause a little bit of congestion but i think weve learnt from experience in the last six to nine months and were moving into a more proactive way of determining where these customers of pre paid services are likely to be
3892362 we may also deploy additional capacity to handle an anticipated increase in network load during festive seasons at specific areas
3892363 the situation has in fact generally improved over recent years
3892364 after the olympics i will go back home quickly and make up for the love i have missed
3892365 without the support of my family i would not have made a new challenge
3892366 massive restructuring to transform into a dynamic multi industry player

3892370 it is the companys policy to not comment on rumours or hearsay the company will not get involved in mr lees personalinvestment activities which have no impact on the companys operations and interest
3892371 some of our favorite people are here in europe so making an official introduction here was part of the plan from the beginning

3892374 must seek legal action to compel the controller to comply with the law
3892375 we have enough money to pay all the states obligations through the month of september and into october
3892376 we had such a legacy such a history we couldnt escape it even if we tried
3892377 it was very difficult and one of the things that i remembered was after i did my first screen test one executive freaked out and said please never ever ever show your stomach in public ever again never so thats why im like naked in the show all the time as youll see
3892378 television has changed a lot and also its wonderful to be working with vh1 who have been incredible in really allowing us to be ourselves which is a major problem in television when you work with an artist and you try to create a show
3892379 its something that i havent seen since i was a kid

3892381 the child on camera should be flawless in image internal feeling and expression lin miaoke is excellent in those aspects
3892382 theyve finally after all these years theyve gotten the names out all of these people had been told never to mention they were with the oss

3892386 well let people file by the bed and watch us go to sleep i think we can hang with the best of them until midnight
3892387 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3892388 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3892389 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3892390 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3892391 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3892392 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3892393 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3892394 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3892395 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3892396 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3892397 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3892398 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3892399 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3892400 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3892401 wenn einer ins amt k me der die w hler so an der nase herumgef hrt hat dann w re das ein skandal f r diese republik
3892402 es hat den anschein als wolle frau ypsilanti entgegen dem rat von herrn beck ein zweites mal gegen die wand laufen
3892403 i mean i havent tried them but they must be fun because people love them but to me it seems like if youre going to put that much effort into playing something you should just play a real instrument
3892404 what children liked about virtual worlds was the chance to create content such as music cartoons and video and the tools that measured their standing in the world compared to others virtual worlds can be a powerful engaging and interactive alternative to more passive media they really do have good ideas to contribute and they are very good critical friends
3892405 at the time the requirement of a plant in mexico was an incentive to get pharmaceutical companies to invest in this country they were protected and no one else could compete but that had to come to an end sooner or later
3892406 the requirement for a local plant was part of another era with globalisation and the growing openness of markets it had to come to an end now the challenge is for the authorities to ensure quality control of imported medicines
3892407 the indiscriminate importation of medicines from anywhere in the world
3892408 who receive wages and benefits that far surpass national standards
3892409 unlike some of our colleagues in the industry we believe that the pharmaceutical firms operating in mexico are in a position to compete and even to export and that the opening up of the market should be seen as a new opportunity
3892410 the measure endangers public health security without any evidence that it will have the intended result
3892411 there is no evidence at all that proves that this will lead to a reduction in prices
3892412 we are announcing that 21 positions are being eliminated in the austin office of ncsoft in the area of product development

3892446 for some overwhelmed emmy voters a little advice about whats great has to go a long way
3892447 but they never listened to us on the wire no matter what we wrote
3892448 its hard not to hear the praise or see the quotes in the for your consideration ads especially when theyre from major papers and not ieatyourshrimp com but i honestly dont know how much influence we have
3892449 it just depends on the kind of show and where it is
3892450 i do think critical buzz helped mad men but mad men just being what it is helped itself
3892451 its such a compelling and exciting world its so glamorous edgy and dark it just needed to get seen to get nominated
3892452 the wire was hurt by not being shot in l a
3892453 it was out of sight out of mind im not beyond thinking there could have been race issues involved too as least in terms of appeal
3892454 my take on the wire and friday night lights is those arent inviting to emmy voters
3892455 they dont speak to the worlds voters live in or want to live in
3892456 theyre too dense and honestly too smart you have to watch them from the beginning to see all the layers and connections
3892457 its much harder to see the craft in a lights or wire in one episode in a screening room
3892458 you watch james spader get the upper hand on the supreme court then you watch these sad complicated kids from texas and the big stylized show wins every time theyre not going to take our word lights was better than the episode they saw
3892459 its a show we like but it had an uneven season still it got nominated based on a few killer episodes
3892460 the fact that we hammer on them year after year for making blunders like ignoring the wire has to get their attention
3892461 in the last three years they seem to be more contemporary theyre paying attention to shows that arent just ratings hits but are high quality television the award is for outstanding achievement not outstanding ratings

3892470 ive been trying to be a hero and come back too fast
3892471 ive given it all ive got this year even when people doubted that id ever pick up a ball again
3892472 im not going to pick up a ball for 12 days and im not going to go out there and pitch until my arm feels 100 percent right now im just bringing the team down
3892473 he blew up scar tissue and thats a process that he is going to have to go through
3892474 i threw about 20 25 pitches and faced a few hitters

3892478 demeaning portrayals of women dampen the dreams of our daughters
3892479 hesitancy and habit of avoiding hard choices exacted a price that eventually sank her chances at the presidency
3892480 veteran bigfoot tracker tom biscardi said hes examined the body and that scientists will get their chance soon
3892481 most people from other towns come here and look around and scout it out and put a calculator to it and just go home
3892482 so what is it going to take for more shops to open in new york city
3892483 if only you women would get rich like me sexism wouldnt be a problem plus you could afford to make yourself pretty
3892484 hi everybody i hope that the denver convention will be turned into the american equivalent of tiananmen square
3892485 i started saying this was more than my candidate versus your candidate
3892486 the conference was moved to a new location we made an agreement with all our participants that we would treat the proceedings as confidential there was a great deal of information that was generated that our members want to disseminate to their colleagues in their own way
3892487 i really believe she will be the nominee i wouldnt be doing this if i didnt
3892488 i got into politics because i want a better world for my daughters
3892489 what bugs me is that no one is standing up and screaming at this insanity how in the world do they justify casey speaking on the anniversary of womens suffrage and dont get me started on the anti gay warner being the key note
3892490 he was the first governor in virginia to include sexual orientation in that executive order
3892491 and that was a very significant milestone for us in the state
3892492 we would be i assume beginning a different kind of conversation with someone like him than we would with someone like udall who has a very clear record on our issues in the house
3892493 he was always willing to sit down with us and talk with us about the things that we were concerned about
3892494 but his record on gay issues is mixed in recent years hes opposed marriage equality and civil unions supported allowing gay couples to enter into private contracts that grant each other rights and opposed a state constitutional ban on gay marriage
3892495 taking in my opponents performances is a little like watching a big summer blockbuster and an hour in realizing that all the best scenes were in the trailer you saw last fall

3892509 jerry i cant take any credit im a little bit like you kind of a nobody albeit with several knighthoods but in so many ways quite ordinary sometimes i look at my plaques my awards to me theyre just another form of wallpaper dozens and dozens of them and i think do i really deserve these theres the one i received for saving queen elizabeths life there are the many honors bestowed on me by governments medical schools three or four nobel prizes a half dozen awards for advancements in physics chemistry genetics and dog grooming why because im better than everyone else or have i received them because it makes people feel good knowing that they once got close enough to me to shake my hand and give me another amazing award youve got to believe me jer when i say that im really just a little frightened pug from the england the sceptred isle im just a pug and maybe even a very ordinary pug like you
3892510 gosh ben youve made me feel so much better but for all that ben i cant help thinking that you are possibly the worlds greatest writer not ej who gets the credit and the money he likes to have his name in lights and hes easily swayed by public opinion he wants to be the center of attention he has to take all the glory for himself i can tell you that hes in for a big let down when the public finds out that youre the real genius who writes the ben and jerry in paradise stories

3892560 when some beet field peon takes a few traces of this stuff he thinks he has just been elected president of mexico so he starts out to execute all his political enemies
3892561 all mexicans are crazy and this stuff marijuana is what makes them crazy
3892562 under the influence of hashish those fanatics would madly rush at their enemies and ruthlessly massacre every one within their grasp
3892563 the american medical association knows of no evidence that marihuana is a dangerous drug
3892564 i feel bad for the poor horse hes probably going to die soon anyway
3892565 as long as hes being taken care of they should leave him alone
3892566 i would prefer to have him remain as stable as he is and be able to enjoy his life i like to go out and pet him its just a matter of feeding and petting him i would be totally lost at the point where he disappears from the scene
3892567 i saw someone characterize our profits the other day in terms of 1 400 in profit per second well they also need to understand we paid 4 000 a second in taxes and we spent 15 000 a second in cost
3892568 we spend 1 billion a day just running our business so this is a business where large numbers are just characteristic of it
3892569 i can understand why people are very upset and why theyre very worried and concerned about their ability to deal with these high prices
3892570 it does bother me that much of that is directed at us our job is to provide energy to provide it in a means that is reliable and we hope we can provide it in a means thats convenient as well to the consumer
3892571 i dont think theres any question that if these prices 3 50 4 a gallon for gasoline and the follow through effects on the cost of electricity are causing a lot of problems for a lot of americans their budgets just are very difficult for them to accommodate this
3892572 what we can do is add new supply and to provide means for people to use the energy more efficiently which will help reduce demand
3892573 and thats what were spending a lot of our effort doing is working on both sides of the demand equation and the supply equation
3892574 things like providing lighter weight tires tires that retain their pressure more efficiently lighter weight plastics to go into vehicles to reduce vehicle weight
3892575 not realistic for the united states or almost any other country
3892576 im not sure that its even desirable for the united states to pursue that as a goal
3892577 our countrys economy is so interdependent with the rest of the world in so many areas of not just commodities but capital markets so im not sure why we would view energy any differently than the way we view the rest of our economy
3892578 i think the response to that is to have as many diverse supplies of energy as possible and that means both in terms of geographic diversity you want to expose yourself or certainly have access for the american people to as many different geographic sources of supply as possible so the disruption in one area does not leave you hostage to any one area

3892630 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3892631 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how think that
3892632 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
3892633 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
3892634 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over

3892649 bombing civilin is the most famous game for us af starting from dresden and tokyo and in row vietnam lebanon lybia serbia afghanistan iraq
3892650 what resulted was that my ideas lets say essentially dovetailed with those of the regime i came out and declared that i wouldnt abide with the restrictions and i continued to publish the blog like before
3892651 with a media blackout in place t he only source of independent although biased news remains the various blogs maintained by individuals in armenia and a handful of international news agencies that have limited access to properly assess the situation in the country
3892652 i myself create it edit it censor it publish it distribute it and may get imprisoned for it
3892653 content and relevance of blogs on armenia was at first nothing really worth writing home about most posts by foreigners living in the capital almost entirely focused on how good their lives were

3892655 f there are indeed haitian athletes in beijing who decide to defect i could not blame them
3892656 do you think a new haiti is possible and are you prepared to do what it takes to get it to a point where it produces 300 000 potential olympians a year rather than 300 000 child slaves
3892657 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3892658 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3892659 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3892660 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3892661 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3892662 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3892663 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3892664 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3892665 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3892666 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3892667 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3892668 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3892669 well the reason that i am listening to my feelings now is because they are the voice of my soul

3892771 in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon a throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory
3892772 who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders
3892773 to whom then will ye liken god or what likeness will ye compare unto him to whom then will ye liken me or shall i be equal saith the holy one
3892774 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
3892775 o the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of god how unsearchable are his judgments and his ways past finding out for who hath known the mind of the lord or who hath been his counsellor or who hath first given to him and it shall be recompensed unto him again for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory for ever amen

3892778 t he governing institutions to which we give the power to set our priorities and our collective course we might wonder how such reckless injustice could happen in a world governed by democratically elected governments the answer is both simple and alarming our world is not governed by democratically elected governments it is ruled by global financial institutions in the service of financial speculators who exchange trillions of dollars each day in search of instant unearned profits to increase the fortunes and the power of the richest people on the planet global financial institutions bring down governments that displease them and buy and sell the largest corporations like commodities by design and law the defining priority and obligation of these governing institutions is to generate financial profits to make rich people richer in short to increase inequality in a world in desperate need of greater equity to this end the corporations that rise or fall at the pleasure of the speculators assault our eyes and ears with advertising messages intended to get those of us who already have more stuff than we need to buy more stuff that is the big picture in summary we must 1 bring human consumption into balance with earths natural systems by eliminating unproductive consumption and by restoring and even enhancing earths natural regenerative processes 2 we must bring our human relationships into balance with one another by sharing resources and knowledge equitably and turning from a culture of competition and private accumulation to a culture of cooperation and sharing 3 we must create a system of radically democratic life serving governing institutions that support balanced relationships with one another and earth give voice to every person and nurture the higher order potentials of the human consciousness

3892810 as they neither seek an apology nor do they opt to argue and reiterate their stand which has tarnished the image of the highest court a four month imprisonment would serve the ends of justice
3892811 truth is an explicit defense under the contempt of court act
3892812 the publications in the garb of scandalizing a retired chief justice of india have in fact attacked the very institution
3892813 lowered the dignity of the supreme court in the eyes of the public
3892814 the courts may permit in any proceedings for contempt of court justification by truth as a valid defence if it is satisfied that it is in public interest and the request for invoking the said defence is bona fide
3892815 lowered the dignity of the supreme court in the eyes of the public
3892816 a child drops out of school and starts working for a meagre amount because staying in the school seems a waste of time there are no guarantees even after completing school he will do the same job so he starts to supplement the family income and with no one in the community to suggest otherwise the child becomes a labourer it is lack of social responsibility more than poverty that causes child labour
3892817 there has to be incentive and motivation to go to school instead of punishment in failing to go
3892818 we lose sight of our goal if we segregate it from the larger picture if you aim to eradicate only child labour in a community you will never succeed unless you improve the finances of the community by micro credit assist them in setting up institutions like citizen centres and schools and provide them with basic health and hygiene facilities
3892819 more than 150 hectares of our land have become too saline for farming and the remaining 350 hectares will also become useless if the sand mining doesnt stop
3892820 earlier we used to get 25 bags of ground nuts from one acre but last year we got only 10 bags
3892821 each bag sells for close to rs 1000 with losses of rs 15 000 each harvest how long will we survive
3892822 what does a farmer do when the soil goes salty the farmer abandons it but even manual labour does not put food in his belly
3892823 agriculture is not enough to support the family so the men have started to move to the towns they work for rs 100 a day but they spend more than rs 20 reaching the town and there is no guarantee that they find work every time they go
3892824 at 22 i had a husband steady income and a home today i have nothing
3892825 there can be no doubt that speedy trial and by speedy trial we mean reasonably expeditious trial is an integral and essential part of the fundamental right to life and liberty enshrined in article 21
3892826 its the constitutional right of every accused person who is unable to engage a lawyer and secure legal services on account of reasons such as poverty indigence or incommunicado situation to have free legal services provided to him by the state and the state is under a constitutional mandate to provide a free lawyer if free legal services are not provided to such an accused the trial itself may run the risk of being vitiated
3892827 rule of law is basic structure of constitution of india every individual is guaranteed the its give to him under the constitution in absence of legal aid trial is vitiated

3892840 im pretty sure im sick and tired and they are sick and tired of hearing about greece but we just got to approach it as another game another team thats in our way for the gold medal
3892841 i remember that we missed a ton of free throws 14 of their 34
3892842 and the pick and roll game we couldnt adjust to the pick and roll game by the time we adjusted the game was over
3892843 i was stunned if you can see the footage from that game i didnt want to get off the court after the game
3892844 the city is on the hook for the whole 100 percent project
3892845 were talking close to a million dollars if the state opts out of it
3892846 will do everything in my power to see that we get reimbursed
3892847 its probably 95 percent were going to get the money
3892848 it makes me question what the heck is going on
3892849 the council has to have more input with the money

3892859 development of us oil shale resources could take a decade or more after start up to mature fully
3892860 the authors of this report have themselves admitted it is barmy it isnt it is insane
3892861 regeneration of our northern cities has been a key conservative theme over the past three years and one of the first things i did as leader was to set up the cities taskforce to look in to how we can further renew and regenerate our great cities
3892862 no one is suggesting that residents should be forced to move but we do argue that they should be told the reality of the position regeneration in the sense of convergence will not happen because it is not possible
3892863 claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3892864 but the issue is clear current regeneration policies are failing the very people they are supposed to be helping and there is no evidence that the trend will be reversed without radical changes
3892865 internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic
3892866 for the last decade british politics has been dominated by ministers who represent poorer urban areas and the new labour government has invested heavily in urban regeneration
3892867 a future conservative administration more representative of suburbs and the south would most probably have a very different set of priorities
3892868 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3892869 reaffirms policy exchanges long standing commitment to localism a commitment we have pledged in our previous reports on urban regeneration

3892878 mr lehmann had been brutally bashed probably with a blunt object
3892879 investigators have been following several lines of inquiry over the past six months but at this time they have all been exhausted
3892880 we are aware that he had planned an imminent trip overseas to visit a critically ill relative in the days prior to his death mr lehamnns relatives in germany are desperate for answers about his death
3892881 to me it was little clownish for our part to be doing that the sponsor insisted and insisted they pushed because theyre the people that pay the money it was just a bad idea to do that it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3892882 if anyone feels offended by it we totally apologise for it

3892887 being asian and seeing this however i do want to shake my fist
3892888 its unforgivable that this governor would side with a corporation with dupont without understanding the intricacies
3892889 nobody from the governors office came to the trial one day nobody from the governors office came to see what happened nobody from the governors office reviewed any documents nobody from the governors office made a call to the people who were affected
3892890 nobody from the governors office read the transcripts the governors office simply became a puppet for dupont thats not uncommon for dupont thats how they operate
3892891 critical to the fair and rational imposition of punitive damages
3892892 has recognized that detailed appellate review of punitive awards serves as the foundation of the procedural rights afforded to litigants
3892893 parties commonly request such briefs from those that may have an interest in the issues presented by an appeal
3892894 like any person or organization dupont is entitled to raise issues of public concern with state officials the first amendment protects and encourages such communications the governor made his own independent judgment that the issues in this case are of public significance and filed his own brief
3892895 the plaintiffs should have the same right the defendant has
3892896 you can go and search forever and you wont find a governor that mixes public policy with judicial review if this type of argument is made it is typically made by the attorney generals office its like mixing apples and oranges
3892897 the governor neither opines on the underlying merits of the case nor argues for the reversal or modification of the jurys verdict
3892898 even had the governor not met with the president of dupont not met with the chief counsel of dupont and have people inside his own office related to dupont business filing the brief would have been suspect anyway
3892899 add all those factors in and the level of scrutiny should be increased
3892900 west virginia is virtually the only state that does not provide an automatic full appellate review of a punitive damages judgment
3892901 dupont is simply seeking a full and fair review of the trial court outcome which the company believes is infected by serious legal errors
3892902 the plaintiffs are trying to deny dupont its day in court if the plaintiffs were confident that their verdict was supported by the facts and the law they would not be so worried about the west virginia supreme court providing a full appeal
3892903 a west virginia jury exercising the sovereign power of the state has punished dupont severely
3892904 petitioner now seeks what due process requires a meaningful adequate and de novo review of its nine figure punishment such an exacting and fresh examination of the record even if affirmance is warranted should be provided
3892905 this is not a conflict between ossetins and georgians this is a proxy war between united states and russia we have to understand that and act accordingly that is in line with our sco and csto obligations

3892923 we wholeheartedly endorse this colossal waste of funds not only is moveon orgs anti drilling position out of step with 70 percent of americans but a member like mike conaway who represents the texas oil patch will probably see his approval rating surge upward as a result of these ads
3892924 moveon org doesnt have the greatest political credentials at least in conaways district
3892925 hes in the heartland of the oil and gas industry where a lot of people have ties to that industry
3892926 whites fear discrimination by public services some 29 per cent of people surveyed think public sector workers discriminate against them in favour of other ethnic groups and many believe they have been passed over for promotion or a job because of the colour of their skin and the study reveals that ethnic groups living in the uk feel stronger ties to the country than native whites researchers found that whites also felt less able than other ethnic groups to influence decisions affecting the country or their local area and many believe racial prejudice is on the rise in stark contrast with other races

3892942 will be coming to atlanta on august 18 for a very special event at the marriott marquis downtown and i have agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team
3892943 if you select to use your credit card you may fax the form to me

3892945 do you think you might be able to contact karl as i am sure you have more weight there
3892946 talked to rove about this and i think i killed it hes on it keep this between us dont want to raise expectations but i banged on this one hard
3892947 were going to need to dl him obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of this
3892948 i think were all hoping itll be shorter rather than longer but how he responds to it is going to be whats meaningful
3892949 its something serious because every little move you make in your core area just moving breathing can be a hard time for guys having that injury
3892950 it goes away over time but you cant really do anything except let it heal
3892951 putting casey in a guy whos hitting 350 a professional hitter and moving youk over to third thats huge
3892952 otherwise we have the ability to have shortstop jed lowrie play third put alex cora at short if we have the lead tonight we might do that anyway
3892953 its going to be tough not having him out here at third base and in the lineup youre never going to have that same guy like mike lowell in the lineup
3892954 in case something happens we had a lot of guys throwing a lot of pitches last night the chances are that after tonights game everything going to plan maybe well make another move but were going to go one at a time here
3892955 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
3892956 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3892957 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back

3892959 this is a swing county in a swing state i think we may be up very late on election night waiting for michigan to come in
3892960 the time is now for all of us to take action to bring about an end
3892961 i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3892962 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
3892963 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
3892964 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
3892965 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
3892966 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
3892967 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
3892968 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
3892969 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
3892970 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
3892971 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
3892972 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
3892973 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air
3892974 a lot of people are saying usain and tyson are very strong finishers but if i get out in front of them no matter how they are finishing they wont even close on me
3892975 a gunman barged into the arkansas democratic party headquarters wednesday and shot the state party chairman three times
3892976 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3892977 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him our prayers are with his family during this time
3892978 the suspect was employed as a body shop worker in one of chairman gwatneys auto dealerships it is believed that they were laying a few people off this has nothing to do with party politics
3892979 funny how it always is democrats who get murdered whose airplanes explode etc
3892980 the sickness that is right wing the delusion that is left wing so much hatred has been spewed for the last 7 years on both sides
3892981 nteresting as a republican conservative i have never heard of any republicans call for the death of liberals i have however read liberals on move on org huffington post and daily kos hope for the death of republicans who had cancer like snow and novak yet here we have liberals claiming that all the hate is on the right i think the difference is that wishing people dead on the liberal side is mainstream to the liberals and a republican suggesting that obama is wrong on an issue is extremist behavior to the same liberal
3892982 home grown american terrorism pure and simple and directed solely at democrats and liberals
3892983 its presumptuous and rather exploitative to infer that what happened had anything to do with party politics
3892984 im sorry if i offended you my friends think im pretty bold bwahahahaha
3892985 you know i find most tattoos too busy yours arent too busy

3892990 he is very demanding and i think he is looking for that next level of achievement in terms of performance
3892991 its very clear to me that there are pathways to growing that even more building up the basic sciences here and clinical research
3892992 the educational programs here are actually very cutting edge and theyre already highly regarded in american medicine
3892993 in fact many medical school educational programs are patterned after whats taking place first at wake forest
3892994 i think that one of my major roles is going to be to communicate both regionally statewide and nationally about the true strengths of this institution

3892996 the premium commission shall perform the functions described in this section by considering existing financial simulations and analyses of universal health care proposals including but not limited to the analysis completed by the lewin group in january 2005 of senate bill 921 of the 2003 04 regular session
3892997 this was proof of principle in patients who had failed the standard therapies and had few if any remaining options
3892998 these patients had been through experimental treatments so it is not like we got anybody who had standard of care left weichselbaum said
3892999 although our radiation wasnt able to control the disease in everybody if we had treated where they had recurred with further radiation surgery or other types of ablation they could have been rendered disease free
3893000 most likely this will be used with the targeted therapies
3893001 image quality is excellent however higher iso do show a lot of digital noise and the as you pump the iso the dynamic range tends to degrade quite a bit white balance under fluorescent light did produce some unfavorable results and to make white balance adjustments on the e3 just takes too long all in all the e3 is a beast of a camera that produces good quality images but needs the tender care of more advanced photographers to make it really shine
3893002 make no mistake this camera is not intended for the consumer market it is intended however for the person who knows exactly what they are doing performance was top notch except for its low light focusing which the reviewer felt was sluggish this is a tank like camera that does most things pretty well and the things its not so good at there are workarounds
3893003 if you use price as a deciding factor the e 3 represents a great value granted it would be more attractive with higher resolution and faster frame rate but as the reviewer notes not everyone needs or wants those two things iso performance was clean and sharp detail up to 400 even at iso 800 the pictures had noise but it was distracting
3893004 the reviewer was a little disillusioned with the smaller sensor size and resulting increase in digital noise photo quality as expected was good and the supplied lens was better than comes with most of the competitions units
3893005 biofos is the olympus user and collectors group and finds the cameras performance stunning the reviewer had reservations about how the e 3 compared to the competitive brands but compared to other olympus models this camera is unmistakably the leader standout items were smoothness agility and outstanding high iso performance one the not so liked list were the cameras size and weight its a beast however the reviewers bottom line is this camera definitely deserves the title of olympus flagship model
3893006 unmistakably a professional camera with top of the line image stabilization high quality images and state of the art dust removal system however according to the reviewer the intuitive and logical design should appeal to just about any photographer looking for pro level results one irritation was in the iso shots taken in natural light had a warm yellow hue compared to other competitive cameras
3893007 not liking a cameras control is one thing but fighting against them is another which is exactly what this reviewer felt he was doing every time he used the camera he commented that making camera controls small and or flush which the cameras body only heightened his frustration while the camera may be a technological marvel this particular review just plain did not like it for general photographic purposes however if youre going to drag your gear into harsh conditions then he admitted that because of the rugged build the e 3 would be at the top of his list
3893008 when you look at the many functions and options the olympus e 3 has you will agree that for a novice the choices to be made can be rather daunting
3893009 photographing with the olympus e 3 is a bit like driving a sports sedan you may not need the speed and power most of the time but youre sure glad its there when you do plus you get comfort and style with your scoot the e 3 is more than competent for everyday shooting and its speed and burst depth handle demanding moments with ease then when youre pushing pixels the files help you get back to pushing shutters sooner
3893010 although the e 3 is a very nice camera to use and has all the functionality a keen photographer would require we feel the majority of serious photographers will need something more than the e 3 offers to attract them to such a big and heavy four thirds dslr olympus is renowned as an innovator so were hoping they have some exciting innovations to offer when the e 4 or e 5 comes along
3893011 im sure there were many photographers who added the e 3 and a favorite lens or two to their dream list during the evening with olympus kit if youre serious about your photography all you have to do is use it to want it i really think that olympus have a world beating system with their dslr range of bodies and the exceptional lens system im sure that many professional photographers currently shooting with conventional dslrs will be shocked to discover the olympus advantage all it takes is an open mind and a thorough test drive
3893012 one thing experienced slr users will instantly notice is the units design built from a magnesium shell the e 3 feels extremely solid it sits nicely in the hands and although the two scroll wheels could be arranged slightly more comfortably the overall control layout is very intuitive the body is also splash proof and as we watched someone poor a jug of water over the camera and then have it keep on going straight away we can definitely attest to how effective this is
3893013 expectations were quite high also because it concerned a successor of the olympus e 1 that already proved itself in practice
3893014 if youre used to a mode dial that lets you get lazy and turn to the little running man for a sports shot or the mountain for a landscape well forget it the e 3 is more serious than that but if you want virtually total control this is your camera the body is festooned with more than 20 buttons and dials along with an encyclopedia of menus
3893015 the e3s exposure system was one of the best ive used compensation was rarely needed i wish that was the case with the pentax k10d and ist d i use regularly and the konica minolta 7d i also use occasionally
3893016 theres a lot of nonsense discussion about dynamic range partly fueled i think by dpreviews poor dr test methodology as exposed by jay turberville and others what i did experience was a dreadful overcast friday morning you know where you shoot anything with sky and can expect either blown sky or ridiculously underexposed ground detail the e 3 gave me a well exposed balanced image which coped perfectly with the scene i dont know whether this was dr shadow adjustment technology or what but i was very impressed
3893017 olympus just flew european journos to istanbul turkey to introduce their new dslr the e 3 of course we could test the camera ourselves although its still a preproduction model so there will be some improvements and added features in the final version nevertheless it clearly shows that olympus took a giant stride forward improving some aspects markedly while catching up with the competition in other regards
3893018 the olympus e 3 is by far the most advanced olympus digital camera ive used very satisfying to shoot with and one of the more compelling slrs launched this season its design though big is ergonomically pleasing and handsome and it gives you a feel of confidence and control the build matches the sturdy feel of olympuss high end lenses which are some of the tightest weve seen
3893019 aside from the lcd the viewfinder on the e 3 has also been improved it now shows 100 percent of what the camera will capture a magnification factor of 1 15 times further helps to enlarge the viewfinder image

3893023 without just cause or reason without legal or moral justification and without a thread of proof that iraq directly threatens the security of the united states the bush administration has headed to war as i am writing this bombs are raining upon the defenseless civilians of baghdad in a continuation of a policy that has already claimed the lives of over 1 million innocent iraqi people people just like us who want democracy but find themselves cornered by a dictator on one side naked u s aggression on another and the oil beneath their country for which it appears they are to be massacred lies sanctions and cruise missiles have never created a free and just society only everyday people can do that which is why im joining the millions world wide who have stood up to oppose the bush administrations attempt to expand the u s empire at the expense of human rights at home and abroad in this spirit im releasing this song for anyone who is willing to listen i hope it not only makes us think but also inspires us to act and raise our voices

3893046 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events

3893072 the classic way of ensuring that there is no food in the future
3893073 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand and if they think its somehow going to work because they are going to have one form of clever genetic engineering after another then again count me out because that will be guaranteed to cause the biggest environmental disaster of all time
3893074 he seems to be ranting about gm crops urbanisation globalisation and even hybrid plants he is inflating fears instead of contributing to reasoned debate
3893075 gm crops are not to blame for climate change the industrialisation of agriculture the spread of dysfunctional conurbations the salinisation of australia or indeed any of the other crimes of which the prince appears to accuse them
3893076 prince charles has hit the nail on the head about the damaging false solution that gm crops present gm crops will not solve the food crisis and forging ahead with an industrialised farming system will continue to fail people and the environment around the world
3893077 the prince is an organic farmer and its in his interest that organic farming works
3893078 there are millions of other farmers whose role is producing high quality affordable food and they need all the tools that are available of which gm is one
3893079 while i admire prince charless commitment to environmental causes his lack of scientific understanding and his willingness to condemn millions of people to starvation in areas like sub saharan africa is absolutely bewildering

3893184 the location the time of year people coming to florida from colder climates the fact this race is putting an emphasis on masters runners in addition to the open runners its a nice change of pace im really looking forward to running this is a good race for the sport as a whole
3893185 our little corridor of east central florida has long deserved a classic running event of its own
3893186 there are some very good regional events around here but nothing like we are planning for the melbourne amp the beaches weve had tremendous enthusiasm and support from the community and our focus on the masters the courses route along the indian river and all the bands should make this a pretty special run
3893187 the melbourne palm bay area chamber of commerce is very excited to have the melbourne amp beaches music marathon set to take here in melbourne
3893188 from the chambers business standpoint the event is sure to bring many new visitors to our area visitors who will stay in our hotels dine in our restaurants and shop in our stores these visitors will get to discover the beauty of south brevard and were confident that when they do they will want to come back again and will also tell others all about us
3893189 this emphasis on the masters divisions should get people to travel to florida and create a great race with the beaches and music added were looking at something that could be pretty big

3893226 our placements throughout the network on industry blogs and related sites have given us great exposure to hr professionals looking for information on icims or on talent management technology platforms we look forward to continued success with the program

3893231 when i look across the 16 intelligence agencies and the dni is included in that bucket and i see the way theyre beginning to embrace new tools to communicate across these organizations my belief is that that does not weaken any one organization i think it strengthens all of them

3893237 when theyre here theyre focused on getting the job done because the mission is priority to them
3893238 were a secretive intelligence service so we know things here that we cant talk about and a lot of it is very very positive
3893239 because of the history and things that have happened in the past its always going to be a lightning rod when theres a discussion about this agency
3893240 one of my roles that i take very seriously is to isolate our folks from the stuff that gets put out thats not true i basically tell them not to worry about it and focus on mission
3893241 i cant get into specific details about what we use
3893242 selective citations sweeping assertions and a fascination with the negative
3893243 the problem with our organization is that we cant talk about all these things
3893244 i think if the american public knew how effective this organization is there would be a different tone
3893245 it doesnt get any easier when theres a change of administration
3893246 it doesnt get any easier when theres a change of administration

3893391 it shows how in the days of the empire celtic broke barriers living up to the ideal of he civilising mission and how this indian in bare feet enchanted one half of glasgow
3893392 at that time with indian nationalists fighting for independence from british colonial rule many indians took to football to answer british jibes that indians were not manly enough to rule themselves the indians played in bare feet and despite this they defeated english men in boots which was seen as evidence that indians were not inferior to the british
3893393 a great player from india has come by ship will you please take a trial of his but there is a slight problem salim plays in bare feet

3893396 i had no intention of asking for money it was just a ploy to find out if mohammed salim was still alive in their memory to my amazement i received a letter from the club inside was a bank draft for 100 i was delighted not because i received the money but because my father still holds a pride of place in celtic i have not even cashed the draft and will preserve it till i die

3893399 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

3893401 to many voters the mccain of 2000 is the true mccain with his latest statements constituting an understandable if undignified pander to the gops right wing base they simply cannot believe that the maverick who defied the partys hard core social conservatives on embryonic stem cell research and campaign finance reform would toe the conservative line on abortion but in truth it was his 2000 position on abortion that was the outlier a short lived attempt to court the center after george w bush had locked up the religious rights support mccain is not and never was a moderate
3893402 the public wants to believe this maverick image and voting records are boring
3893403 no matter how many times he says centrist sounding things anyone who looks at his record can see that he has been with the rascals every time he will do as he has done since 1982 which is not a short record and people should believe it

3893613 well i couldnt believe i was on the floor i new i blah bah blah
3893614 so knowing that you cost your team the gold medal what did you say to you teammates when you first saw them
3893615 so how did you feel when you made even more mistakes during the floor exercise at that point did you know for sure that you had cost the united states of america your country the gold medal
3893616 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice

3893624 mccain has promised and reaffirmed his commitment to continue the same policies weve had these past eight years for another four
3893625 we cannot do that barack obama has lifted our spirits and led us to believe yes we can solve the global climate crisis address the other issues we have to take on and has said we can come together and create a new century with bright hope
3893626 you want some advice make iraq the 51st state and lets get the hell out of there
3893627 these are not normal times the relationship between the planet and ourselves has been irrevocably and dramatically altered were a bull in a china shop today as the sun sets we will have put another 70 million tons of global warming pollution into the atmosphere
3893628 just so you all know we did set a record
3893629 ive been involved in fundraising a long time and to have two incredible men who were nominees and both should have been president and also the fact i got a nobel prize winner and an academy award winner this is too much even for me
3893630 he promised america it would be a campaign of respect of ideas not insults and the american people wanted a better campaign and he gives you paris hilton and britney spears
3893631 if he cant keep his word about the campaign and he cant keep his word about the issues that are really important to the american people and he makes the wrong judgments about how to protect america then his candidacy is in fact dangerous in terms of americas security and you cant trust it and you cant trust him thats what this is about
3893632 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
3893633 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
3893634 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
3893635 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
3893636 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
3893637 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
3893638 im not a hypocrite i dont see things as right left i see things as right wrong so just because the people at fox like the sean hannitys of the world dont want to accept that theres climate problems theres enough information out there that im concerned
3893639 so al gore says were going to put a set of commercials together where two enemies get together on one cause and say lets support this so theyre going to get donald trump and rosie odonnell to do one and me and my arch enemy to do one
3893640 i gave them two dates because i was doing the movie and i was doing my family vacation and then i had to get the sound track ready for the movie get my album ready the 35 hits do a ford truck commercial and start rehearsing for the tour
3893641 just one of those unfortunate things it could still happen
3893642 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
3893643 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
3893644 no rule to pursue but such as he prescribes to himself
3893645 should be as little dependent as possible on those of the others
3893646 if it be wished that my relation to the bank be continued it may be well to send me the usual retainer
3893647 that the dependency of private funding simply shifts the focus of congress thats all and if so is this really the issue to worry about
3893648 whom i think it does compromise they feel like they have to ameliorate or change their position for fear of losing certain contributions
3893649 it is very difficult for me to accept that people dont consciously or subconsciously tailor their views to where they know the sources of campaign funding can be
3893650 how are we going to raise money from those guys if we deregulate them
3893651 should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled their views about global warming will change accordingly therefore you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue in the debate
3893652 as real a revolution in the principles of government as that of 1776 was in its form
3893653 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
3893654 as we come closer to the peoples vote they get closer to corporate power
3893655 things are getting so bad for libertarians and liberals theres starting to be a convergence of interests
3893656 you cant focus on voters rights and ignore candidate rights
3893657 for all practical purpose we are no much better than the chinese political model expect that in china there is no gridlock and things are getting done
3893658 i am really beholdin to corporate interests they give me a great paycheck and have provided me with the highest standard of living in history comment by lackeynlovenit august 6 2008 at 5 05 pm
3893659 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
3893660 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

3893664 i think global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
3893665 but i think that global warming alternative energy and solar energy in particular like al gore are all overblown
3893666 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
3893667 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
3893668 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
3893669 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
3893670 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
3893671 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
3893672 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
3893673 were the large group just inside the doors on the right

3893676 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
3893677 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
3893678 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
3893679 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3893680 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3893681 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3893682 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3893683 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
3893684 once the kids came i kind of semi retired carvey says by phone from a hotel room in los angeles where he is working on the early stages of an upcoming movie comedy for paramount
3893685 i really didnt want to be one of those guys
3893686 squatting monkeys tell no lies which was shot in santa rosa straddles the manic and reflective
3893687 i think when dana was working on his special he kind of fell in love with standup again says cobbs comedy club booker tom sawyer who regularly hired carvey at the club in the 80s
3893688 before he was kind of walking through it and now hes really passionate about it
3893689 i saw a movie and i had him for a day and i lost him it just hits you or it doesnt
3893690 i did snl i did some movies my kids have grown up ive saved a lot of money that will go over good and im having fun
3893691 i sort of remember looking at it and thinking someones got to do something about this
3893692 to my complete surprise and shock people were obeying my traffic signals
3893693 there were all kinds of impromptu block parties that happened all over the city restaurants did their best to accommodate their customers when something like a blackout occurs people generally are going to pitch together and help out everyone else it sounds kinda hokey but its the truth
3893694 the price of gasoline in the last year has had a bigger impact on peoples thoughts about conservation than the blackout
3893695 we never found in much of the research we had done that there was a direct connection between the big blackout and issues around using too much or too little energy
3893696 i think people are creatures of habit to some degree and i dont think theres any lingering effects in reduced consumption from the blackout
3893697 the individual customers out there i believe want to help
3893698 to me it was the blackout day that got me thinking more and more about the environment and everything ive been doing it was just amazing how much we could get done without electricity and we actually enjoyed having no power
3893699 there were a few things that wouldve been nice like having the hot water tank working but for everything else we became creative we started having fondue
3893700 it can be contagious if you know one person doing something then another is more likely to start doing it as well and so it creates a chain reaction
3893701 environmental problems have been ongoing for a very long time but now im seeing that people are taking it seriously and i think its only going to increase probably exponentially over the next little while
3893702 there is a direct correlation between how people perceive the economy and the importance they place on the environment when times are tough people resent paying more to salve their conscience
3893703 when people are feeling the pinch we need to make it pay to go green instead of being fined for not recycling households should be paid for recycling
3893704 meanwhile the demand for takeaway pizzas and mcdonalds has risen as people find the cheapest way to eat
3893705 environmentalist did not make gas go to over 4 gallon
3893706 i dont want to have to change my life even it it benefits society as a whole
3893707 humans are an infinitessimally small part of the global eco system
3893708 its the downturn that has made greenery look unappetising but it may yet prove to do more than anything to save the planet
3893709 it runs on biodiesel and im gonna put solar on it someday
3893710 recently mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
3893711 mr obama has been talking more about thrift than trees instead of showing off his recycling skills he explains that his children dont receive christmas or birthday presents
3893712 in searching for a new enemy to unite us we came up with the idea that pollution the threat of global warming water shortages famine and the like would fit the bill all these dangers are caused by human intervention the real enemy then is humanity itself
3893713 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
3893714 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
3893715 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
3893716 a significant shift in where the u s gets its power in 2005 coal supplied slightly more than half the nations 3 7 billion kilowatt hours of electricity nuclear power accounted for 21 percent natural gas 15 percent and renewable sources including wind and solar about 8 6 percent
3893717 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
3893718 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
3893719 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
3893720 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
3893721 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
3893722 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
3893723 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
3893724 i think people across the country look at a debate such as this and they scratch their heads

3893732 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
3893733 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
3893734 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh

3893739 college is a whole different level its a lot harder than i expected it to be
3893740 i was star struck and it was my favorite college and i was from southern california and wanted to be close to home
3893741 but as things progressed i started to notice they had five star athletes at my position that hadnt played the year before
3893742 after football season my senior year i didnt want to sit around and wait i wanted to get right into it
3893743 i dont think its right for every young man to do that obviously he has to have his academics in order to be able to do that everything has to be put in place in terms of his core classes
3893744 but there are also some emotional things that have to be in place to make it work i think its a good thing for those that are capable but its not the right thing for everyone
3893745 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3893746 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3893747 you had a duty as the captain of this plane to call the police and you didnt do it
3893748 is this somehow like the child who kills his parents and then complains about being an orphan
3893749 one of my roles for the brigade was also to be the direct liaison between the brigade combat team leaders and our iraqi provincial leaders our governor the deputy governor and the sheiks
3893750 understanding how to design projects that are effective that are not just band aids
3893751 we tried to work very hard on getting the iraqi municipal and provincial authorities to work together
3893752 because if theyre not working to spend the money and get the services out there the citizenry is left to fend for itself
3893753 so you start by making sure that theyre getting out to seeing their own cities and also communicating the needs
3893754 to watch them interact with one another they are very warm and hospitable
3893755 sometimes all that it takes is getting them all in the same room
3893756 i wouldnt call it magic but it worked very effectively
3893757 i know what we went though in the bad times and the good times i was there for it all except for the first season that they won
3893758 thats the biggest thing changing the culture and getting them to believe in themselves that breeds more success
3893759 kelly was such a positive role model that strong female influence its something that ive gotten so much confidence from my goal is just to do the same with these girls
3893760 kellys always made me feel like i was still a part of it and the players did too it was really unreal just looking back on it is so crazy to think about it it really is
3893761 its a huge motivation for other teams and other new programs and programs that are sort of in that building process it gives you a lot of hope that it can turn around quickly with the right leaders and the right support
3893762 the goal is to savor every moment every practice every game
3893763 at northwestern we were in a lot of games that first year that we technically probably shouldnt have been in but because we were fighters we never got down on ourselves
3893764 specially if your partner raises the bedsheets at the wrong time in the middle of the night

3893770 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
3893771 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
3893772 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
3893773 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
3893774 so i ask you to join with me to call on every candidate at every level to accept this challenge for america to be running on 100 percent zero carbon electricity in 10 years
3893775 we need to act now this is a generational moment a moment when we decide our own path and our collective fate
3893776 have warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that within five years the entire north polar ice cap will completely disappear during the summer months
3893777 the arctic ocean was much warmer than it is now for several millennia after the end of the last ice age we know this because there are trees buried in the tundra along what is now the arctic shore
3893778 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires
3893779 herald a post civil rights america any more than his victory in november will mean that race as an issue has been vanquished in america
3893780 i am not persuaded that 20 000 additional troops in iraq is going to solve the sectarian violence there in fact i think it will do the reverse
3893781 we just have to slow down our economy and cut back our greenhouse gas emissions because we have to save the planet for our grandchildren
3893782 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
3893783 like barack obama mark warner is not afraid to challenge the status quo to bring people together and get things moving
3893784 its that kind of spirit and innovation that resulted in his selection as keynote speaker on a night when we will be discussing how didnt webb expressly state that he had no interest in the vp spot granted this was a few weeks ago at least but i do recall more than a few articles about it
3893785 remember that it was the democrats who created the kkk as their political action wing they were the same ones who kept segregation going with george wallace leading the fight democrats fought against the emancipation proclamation womens right to vote civil rights and the list goes on martin luther king was a registered republican they use the same plays that they did against lincoln same rhetoric it is amazing these are all facts that the dems dont want you to know they are purpetually reworking history it is proven that most of what they blame on republicans is actually what they are doing or have done
3893786 a source close to kaine said tuesday night before this mornings announcement about warner that the governor had seemed glum and believed that he would
3893787 the love of my life has passed me by my life is over

3893814 and the sad part is that it is keeping all of us from a having a real discussion on things that matter
3893815 as a black man in america i can never deny that race matters but i believe race is the red herring in this campaign folks have gone too far and are too sensitive
3893816 we should all agree that race is a part of this campaign once we acknowledge the elephant in the room perhaps we can start to figure out how to draw the line
3893817 going negative against democrat barack obama isnt just a campaign strategy for republican john mccain

3893825 as wind power capacity rises the lower availability of the wind farms determines the reliability of the system as a whole to an ever increasing extent consequently the greater reliability of traditional power stations becomes increasingly eclipsed as a result the relative contribution of wind power to the guaranteed capacity of our supply system up to the year 2020 will fall continuously to around 4 figure 7 in concrete terms this means that in 2020 with a forecast wind power capacity of over 48 000mw source dena grid study 2 000mw of traditional power production can be replaced by these wind farms

3893828 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3893829 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know former pennsylvania governor tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3893830 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far more so than new york city mayor michael bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues

3893834 our port visit to umm qasr demonstrates the great confidence we have in our iraqi partners and reflects the marked improvements in security that they have achieved within the past several months
3893835 this visit gave us a chance to interact with senior iraqi navy leadership and further enhance coalition cooperation with the iraqi navy and marines
3893836 making a port visit to iraq and interacting with iraqi officers is very important because it builds relationships and promotes positive interaction between our navies
3893837 today was a once in a lifetime opportunity and i am proud to help make a positive difference in iraqs future
3893838 this is an important day for us and for iraq
3893839 having this ship visit umm qasr is a big step and we hope more coalition ships can visit this port as well
3893840 there has been significant progress in iraq during the past year and a half that allowed firebolt to make this port visit to umm qasr
3893841 visits like this are important because they help reinforce the strong ties that already exist between our two navies this visit clearly demonstrates the coalition partnership in maritime security with the iraqi navy and our commitment to the government of iraq and its people
3893842 our forces are here to foster security and cooperation in the region and to conduct operations that contribute to peace and stability
3893843 u s and coalition forces provide the assurance of security and stability that enables the economic development and growing prosperity of the people throughout this region the people of iraq are beginning to enjoy these benefits and our cooperation with the iraqi navy will ensure that they prosper as they expand their participation in the global economy
3893844 about 28 million aids cases could be prevented by 2010 the cost would be 27 billion with monetized socioeconomic benefits almost 40 times as high

3893850 the populations seem to be gradually going downhill and its not clear if or when thats going to stop
3893851 within a decade we may not have any in washington unless they do something
3893852 i have not lost hope for spotted owls but i think were at a pretty serious crossroads
3893853 theres no way at this point to predict how this will ultimately play out
3893854 someone described it as a bathtub its just filling up with barred owls
3893855 if you get a room of field biologists people who have been out in areas where barred owls are present in any number you dont get any disagreement about it
3893856 as a society we may choose not to control barred owls but we ought to do it with the knowledge of what would it take and is it feasible
3893857 you could shoot barred owls forever and as soon as you quit theyre going to be right back
3893858 theyre pulling the habitat rug out from underneath a declining species
3893859 there really isnt any evidence to suggest that creating more habitat reserves will alter adult owl survivorship
3893860 all youre doing is protecting more habitat for the barred owl
3893861 republicans are moving to examine surges in voter registrations in some states a republican lawyers group held a national training session on election law over the weekend that included campaign attorneys for sen john mccain and other republican leaders one session discussed how party operatives can identify and respond to instances of voter fraud
3893862 republicans said they are particularly worried about prospects for fraud in virginia and pennsylvania and are beginning to comb thousands of new registrations in those states for ineligible applicants in some cases the huge numbers threaten to swamp their efforts and those of state and local governments to verify and process applications election officials in virginia and other states say there is no evidence of widespread fraud so far numerous studies have found fraud and other voting irregularities in past elections to be infrequent and generally not prevalent enough to influence the outcomes of most contests some republican lawyers say that despite the huge numbers of new registrations in some areas this years problems could be fewer compared to prior years because of improved procedures and tougher rules
3893863 regardless of how the voters got on the rolls johnson said the sheer number of democrats is a concern this year as is the fact that more hispanics are now registered democrats about 455 000 hispanics are now in the democratic party which only this year surpassed republicans who count 425 000 in their ranks compared to the last presidential election the numbers are even more dramatic for african americans more than 207 000 have joined the democratic party since 2004 accounting for 44 percent of the new voter growth
3893864 the boom that turned swamps and pastures into a suburban mecca has stopped dead now the talk is about plummeting home values rising food costs and gas prices that make the once painless half hour commute to tampa a financial strain its enough to give some here the sense that maybe this time around the republicans do not deserve their votes
3893865 even as younger voters are showing signs of breaking with years of lackluster turnout to support him obama is facing singular resistance from voters over 65 that age group turns out at the highest rate on election day and is disproportionately represented in the swing states of florida and pennsylvania bill clinton and al gore both relied on it in winning the democrats only popular vote majorities of the past two decades
3893866 with polls showing obama dominating among those under 40 and running even among middle aged voters republican john mccains lead among those 65 and older is the main reason he remains close overall his margin is largest among older white voters without a college education accounting for much of obamas problem with the white working class
3893867 by this time in 2004 president bushs re election campaign had spent 13 5 million on television in florida the president went on to win the state in november sen obamas ads have touched every media market in florida which is the most expensive for advertising among the closely fought states
3893868 how the gop is moving to examine these surges in the voting rolls
3893869 weve been able to see a good amount of the underserviced population in the ayacucho region
3893870 speaking spanish wasnt a problem because every group brought spanish speakers
3893871 we had nobody who spoke quechua so we had to rely on the peruvian people to help each other to understand get translators or use the peruvian guards who spoke the language
3893872 the peruvian people received us open handed they opened their arms up came in and trusted us we did each site for several days so after the first day word would spread and more and more people would visit
3893873 i couldnt be happier with how the medretes have gone
3893874 seeing 12 414 in only 24 days is a total task force team effort from the medical providers to the security team from the logistics and civil affairs folks to the volunteers its been an amazing three months of watching different services and career fields come together for the common goal of helping the peruvian people
3893875 the objective of this exercise is to bring our unique abilities together in a common cause defense of the panama canal and the region
3893876 the importance of the panama canal to the worlds economy and the stability enjoyed by the region make them both attractive targets to those who would do harm to either
3893877 the protection of the canal and maintaining stability in the region is truly a worthy goal and one whose achievement benefits all
3893878 it is always good to be welcomed and feel welcome most of all because we want to be here
3893879 when we are finished here we will have built buildings bridges and lasting friendships that will grow with generations to come
3893880 our port visit to umm qasr demonstrates the great confidence we have in our iraqi partners and reflects the marked improvements in security that they have achieved within the past several months

3893888 the locals made a stretcher out of bamboo and tarp
3893889 just like they did for people in world war ii on the kokoda trail
3893890 the last thing i remember was taking a helo flight to the mountains i cant remember much else it is all blank after that
3893891 we assessed that we could make the flight and pick up the patient
3893892 this is the first medevac medical evacuation that i have done the whole crew was prepared this is what we do this is what we train for
3893893 the corpsman assessed her and determined that she could be moved
3893894 we transported her to the helo and started hooking her up to an iv as the helo was departing
3893895 we had her strapped into the back of the helo and treated her as best we could
3893896 we knew she was in bad shape we were just happy that we were able to reach her and get her back to the mercy
3893897 after the patient arrived on mercy she was taken to our casualty receiving emergency room
3893898 she was rapidly assessed by a team of doctors she was found to be unconscious intubated and placed on a respirator
3893899 she was treated in the intensive care unit with intravenous fluids to slowly raise her blood sodium levels
3893900 she rapidly improved with this treatment allowing the respirator to be removed within 24 hours
3893901 they said i freaked out with all the american voices
3893902 to be honest it has all been surreal i dont even comprehend what i have been through
3893903 i drank too much water and not enough endurance powder
3893904 my sodium levels got really low and i got quite sick i was told i had been unconscious and had been in a coma
3893905 i have been blessed fate has been lined up i am fortunate
3893906 the usns mercy was here for two weeks how lucky am i
3893907 my ex husband mother and daughter all came together i couldnt ask for better support
3893908 they have been wonderful the kindness everyone has shown has been remarkable long live the u s navy
3893909 lt sterett was born in baltimore in 1778 and it is fantastic to be in a town with such great nautical history
3893910 he was a brave naval hero at a time when the navy was a fledgling force he is an incredible individual and we welcome his spirit on board
3893911 i never thought id get to come to maryland on board my ship and see my local maryland citizens
3893912 we wanted to become part of cg 31 and carry on the tradition of the sailors who cruised before us
3893913 this commissioning flag was from the vietnam era ships ceremony
3893914 normally the flag is supposed to go the commanding officer but the signalman who raised it kept it
3893915 he said he would be honored if we flew his flag
3893916 there is a great line of history here and this is just another artifact of that history
3893917 to know that another quartermaster or signalman raised this flag up many years ago is very exciting to me
3893918 being so new to the navy its an honor to be a plank owner many years from now i can say i was here when the ship was commissioned i could also say when i was 20 i raised the commissioning flag
3893919 we have a stronger hull as well as improved isolation systems
3893920 this makes it easier to isolate chill water firemains or anything else we need to shut off
3893921 we can use circuit boards and software that are industry standards today
3893922 it keeps us modern and more sophisticated it also allows us to bring the latest and greatest technology to the navy
3893923 many of the countries we are going to have tropical diseases that were not accustomed to in the united states
3893924 malaria can cause a bit of a problem in our troops certainly our primary mission is to take care of patients in these countries but we cant take care of them if we dont take care of ourselves first
3893925 if our members get infected that lessens the opportunity for us to complete our mission so its important that we take our medicine so we can better help the countries that were here to help
3893926 for the crew to be able to come aboard eat aboard hear 1mc ships intercom announcements present colors hoist the american flag muster in the hangar bay and accept their berthing assignments is a step that were that much closer to being uss george h w bush and it sends a message to the crew that were moving forward
3893927 its an honor to be part of history and be one of the first sailors to cross the quarterdeck
3893928 im excited to be getting closer to be able to do my job
3893929 muster the color guard on the quarterdeck with the officer of the deck was the message
3893930 im very honored to be making history as the first petty officer of the watch
3893931 it hasnt hit me yet but for years to come ill know i was the first to stand watch and the first to write in the log book
3893932 it was an exciting honor to raise the ensign for the first time on board cvn 77
3893933 its something no one i know has been able to do and certainly doesnt happen every day
3893934 supply department has been working since july loading a thousand pallets worth of supplies
3893935 its due to the hard work of our food service attendants and culinary specialists that the crew is able to eat
3893936 the best part is that i dont pay for as much as i plan on eating
3893937 its really convenient to be able to just walk upstairs and eat
3893938 weve ramped up our roving patrols and were monitoring the berthings weve started watches on the officer and enlisted brow
3893939 weve always had a presence on the ship but there will be sailors manning all the watches 24 hours a day
3893940 it provides another form of communication besides verbal where ideas can be shared
3893941 it makes a common link between other nations in southeast asia
3893942 instead of e mailing a powerpoint presentation 50 times it can be posted on the web once
3893943 centrixs allows us to help countries in need during a natural disaster
3893944 it helps us work logistically to help countries in need
3893945 information exchange is easier and more secure all information is in encryption
3893946 the c2pc allows situational awareness i can see it as a useful information system when needed
3893947 having the sailors come in and just play video games and share some pizza with the kids is tremendous for them
3893948 i watched every day and there were a ton of kids with nothing to do i started the whole thing just by handing out lunches and playing kickball with them this was a big need that just grew
3893949 the kids really enjoyed themselves and they enjoyed the positive influences i would definitely invite sailors back to the youth center and i would encourage any other organization to have sailors come in to visit anytime
3893950 anytime we can get out there and help kids or let people see what kind of good the navy can do it is a worthwhile cause being able to just hang out and interact with these kids was awesome
3893951 i took the class for the experience because i wanted to be able to assist in the saving of lives and to help in an emergency situation
3893952 i thought this class was very informative and interesting and i feel everyone should have the opportunity to attend such a class to help better the response to emergencies
3893953 taking this certification class is very important because it allows people to become disaster proof meaning that through a natural or unnatural occurrence they are far more likely to survive the initial event and immediate aftermath for themselves and do well afterward
3893954 those who take part in this class and get that certification often help others in the immediate aftermath of a disaster or help others to prepare for it
3893955 i volunteered because i know this sort of training will be very beneficial in the event of an emergency
3893956 with all this training i definitely will be able to help out the community when a natural disaster hits
3893957 this is a great and fun class to for our sailors to get valuable training be prepared for such an event and also to be an asset to the community
3893958 if we have a crisis and have an opportunity to serve then i want to be prepared before vice afterward i think everyone of our sailors should have this training it is an absolute must no way around it
3893959 im so glad we could take the time to do this in the red sea were lucky i see a lot of happy faces and it looks like everyone is having a great time
3893960 this is my sixth or seventh westpac western pacific deployment and this is the first time ive ever been able to do this
3893961 this is a lot of fun boosting the morale of the crew
3893962 its just another day supporting the command but its nice to be out here in the middle of nowhere and being able to put something together like this to remind us all of home
3893963 i like doing this this is my first week on board and its exciting to have the chance to meet new people i really enjoy being able to uplift the crews morale
3893964 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
3893965 individualism puts conservatives at a huge disadvantage as the left swarms through the big institutions they love so dearly the education bureaucracy the colleges all the layers of government institutionalized science the liberal media the only thing that saves conservative politicians is the american people if they happen to feel like it
3893966 the greatest tyrannies are always perpetrated in the name of the noblest causes
3893967 government big enough to supply everything you need is big enough to take everything you have the course of history shows that as a government grows liberty decreases
3893968 the issue today is the same as it has been throughout all history whether man shall be allowed to govern himself or be ruled by a small elite
3893969 the clintons with their folie a deux determined to get four presidential terms two for him and two for her
3893970 and the whole shebang coming to a disastrous climax with hitler mussolini and stalin
3893971 obama was the editor of his class harvard law review bushs daddy bought his way into yale where he graduated in history
3893972 i wish the world was as simple as ole elsie speck thinks it is i have been reading her left field drivel in this paper for years and one thing has never changed her point of view is always waaaaay off the mark nothing more to be said on that issue
3893973 and by the way elsie democrats control every state office and control the legislature in illinois by a wide margin and we all know how that is turning out
3893974 if anyone has been reading these blogs it doesnt take long to realize that nothing would make elsie speck and 1st amendment happier than if every elected office was held by a democrat
3893975 1st amendment wrote on aug 12 2008 10 14 am
3893976 were fighting a war on terror by attacking a country that had nothing to do with terror
3893977 with all due respect donohgod you are an under educated buffoon
3893978 dear elsie speck did you know that the day after russia invaded georgia sen obama demanded for the un to pass resolution condemning russia but was unaware that russia has un security council veto power
3893979 personally i feel that any one that would even consider voting for a muslim or any other foreigner that is for the ruination of the beliefs and customs of our country should be shot for treason
3893980 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
3893981 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
3893982 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
3893983 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
3893984 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
3893985 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
3893986 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
3893987 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
3893988 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
3893989 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
3893990 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
3893991 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
3893992 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
3893993 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
3893994 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
3893995 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
3893996 this helps reduce anxiety in the housing market but more factors need to contribute
3893997 interest rates are not high but they are higher than they were only a short time ago clear and stronger signs from the bank of norway will contribute greatly to stabilizing the housing market
3893998 mr lehmann had been brutally bashed probably with a blunt object
3893999 investigators have been following several lines of inquiry over the past six months but at this time they have all been exhausted
3894000 we are aware that he had planned an imminent trip overseas to visit a critically ill relative in the days prior to his death mr lehamnns relatives in germany are desperate for answers about his death
3894001 the implications of the refugee crisis that is the result of our ill conceived iraq misadventure should not be understated
3894002 the displacement of millions both internally and to neighboring nations only increases the potential for regional volatility and radicalization
3894003 if the refugees do not receive sufficient support from the host governments and the international community
3894004 there is a very real danger that political actors will seek to fill the gap as they reportedly now do inside iraq it is important to remember that both hezbollah and hamas derive much of their popular legitimacy from the fact that they created effective social support systems to help needy people when governments were unable to do so
3894005 interrogation or harassment by militias or other groups with threats to life
3894006 knew someone close to them who had been killed or murdered
3894007 its been a very important thing for the jordanian government especially and for other governments not to want create a refugee situation like the palestinians
3894008 a large number of iraqis are dispossessed with no chance of coming back and thats a fairly fertile ground for recruiting
3894009 iraqi networks its claimed bring money and guns from syria and a lot of that is rooted in the refugee population the leaders of various insurgency factions live in syria and jordan and direct the insurgency from there
3894010 live in abandoned public buildings former military barracks or other collective settlements
3894011 can quickly be erased by inadequate policies toward the displaced
3894012 lacks political will to recognize either the magnitude or the potential consequences of the displacement to do so would be an indication of the governments failure to protect its people
3894013 an aversion to admitting that the safest option for hundreds of thousands of iraqis is to flee the country
3894014 so all you critics sit alone your no better than me for what youve shown with your stomach pumps and hook and ladder dreams we could get together for some scenes
3894015 americans overwhelmingly believe there is an urgent national need to find new sources of energy and this need is more important than reducing energy usage according to a new national telephone survey
3894016 see development of new energy sources as an urgent priority only 9 disagree
3894017 for nearly two thirds 65 finding new sources of energy is more important than reducing the amount of energy americans now consume twenty eight 28 think reducing current usage is more important
3894018 my guess is that the first big shock will come just after the election on november 4 shortly thereafter israel with the blessing of the white house will attack irans nuclear facilities in order to destroy or at least delay its program to develop weapons
3894019 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
3894020 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
3894021 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
3894022 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
3894023 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
3894024 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
3894025 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
3894026 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
3894027 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
3894028 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
3894029 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
3894030 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
3894031 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
3894032 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
3894033 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
3894034 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
3894035 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
3894036 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
3894037 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3894038 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
3894039 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
3894040 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
3894041 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
3894042 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
3894043 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
3894044 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
3894045 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
3894046 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
3894047 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
3894048 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3894049 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
3894050 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
3894051 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
3894052 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
3894053 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
3894054 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
3894055 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
3894056 this was the moment when the rise of the oceans began to slow and the planet began to heal
3894057 anybody gone into whole foods lately and seen what they charge for arugula
3894058 as you may know a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
3894059 normally there is something peculiar about us politicians we all have our foibles david cameron is remarkably free of such flaws he does very normal things like go down to tesco and having his bike stolen
3894060 who is this guy what does he what to do what does he mean by change and what has he done
3894061 i am proud to have helped found the tahoe summit and the health of lake tahoe and its surrounding areas is hugely important to me
3894062 we have accomplished a lot in the past 11 years but we need to continue work on lake clarity and restoration and implementing the environmental improvement program so we can all enjoy lake tahoe for years to come my thanks to all the parties coming to the table to discuss where we are and where we need to go for the future of the lake
3894063 our goal was to protect the military men and women from a vaccine that was neither safe or effective
3894064 if you decided to concoct a mystery thriller plot based on a story where an angry scientist put anthrax in the mail to somehow save a vaccine program it would strike most people as bizarre and far fetched
3894065 one theory is that by launching these attacks he creates a situation a scenario where people all of a sudden realize the need to have this vaccine
3894066 they tried to blame it on al qaida then scientist steven hatfill and finally reluctantly on an actual u s army employed scientist
3894067 they should have immediately been looking at the folks with something to gain by the vaccine program continuing or those who no longer would be embarrassed because their program and lifes work was under attack
3894068 apparently gore and maybe even bush is considering making the anthrax vaccine for the military voluntary or even stopping the program unfortunately since the bioport people arent scientists the task of solving their problem has fallen on us
3894069 i think the is about to hit the fan bigtime the final lot isnt passing the potency test and now theres nothing to back it up plus the control vaccine isnt working its just a fine mess
3894070 bruce had created new anthrax vaccines designed to replace bioports vaccine
3894071 this case wont be brought to closure in a court of law now so i expect there will be some kind of formal congressional setting to ask more questions
3894072 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
3894073 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
3894074 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3894075 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3894076 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3894077 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3894078 radio serves you meatloaf and you know theres steak back in the kitchen
3894079 the scale of the casualties of the war as devastating as they are today was greater back then in vietnam
3894080 plus there was a draft young people then and now are consumers of popular music and there would have been more urgency back then about current events and that would be felt in the kind of music theyd be demanding
3894081 people want to be able to escape when they go into a movie theater put on their ear buds or pick up a trash novel were the stakes higher it wouldnt be as easy to simply escape and you might see more willingness to engage things that address the state of the world
3894082 it causes radio to become more of a mirror rather than a leader
3894083 so when something comes down the pike musically that smacks of controversy and that may blow either way politically and might incite people to feel or react thats considered a risk and with shareholders risk is a bad word
3894084 why would any musician whos ambitious care about what radio stations think theyre not stupid they know radio stations wont play something controversial college public and satellite radio might play it though the other interesting thing about this is that even the toby keith jingoistic material is at a minimum
3894085 in my business theres a term called being dixie chick ed
3894086 ashamed the president of the united states is from texas
3894087 even if some artists might support the war or mccain it would be an unpopular decision to say so and that translates into what youre seeing in music right now a lot of fear
3894088 i hear it all the time on a consumer level a lot of people are getting fed up with the type of music being played
3894089 they played the song once and theyd get a flood of phone calls
3894090 the stations are still after ratings but there are songs that will come through and will alter whats acceptable and push the boundaries id be very surprised if we didnt start seeing more of this
3894091 anti war music has come and gone in waves over the past few years
3894092 while it was easy to believe that artists had been scared into silence many just needed a year or two to get an album out similarly a lot of songs with references to hurricane katrina are just coming out now so we could indeed have the next big statement sitting as a demo on some artists laptop as we speak
3894093 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
3894094 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
3894095 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
3894096 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
3894097 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
3894098 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
3894099 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
3894100 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
3894101 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
3894102 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
3894103 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
3894104 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves

3894113 would have to show that defendants rejected the challenged courses to punish religious viewpoints rather than out of rational concern about the academic merit of those religious viewpoints
3894114 the question the university addresses in reviewing courses is not whether they have religious content but whether they provide adequate instruction in the subject matter
3894115 we also evaluate whether or not they promote the analytical and critical thinking skills necessary to succeed at the university our decisions are made based on the academic merits of the course
3894116 if the scripture verses that begin each chapter were removed the textbook would likely be approved
3894117 agreed with the analyses of experts who found the textbooks academically inadequate
3894118 it appears that uc is attempting to secularize private religious schools
3894119 science courses from a religious perspective are not approved if it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective uc simply denies them

3894155 jerome corsi the right wing fringe author who made his bones smearing the catholic church and lying about my military record is back atop the best seller list with an anti obama book chock full of lies
3894156 weve seen this movie before the republicans without ideas start running a negative campaign filled with personal attacks and misleading ads the attacks get condemned but they get lots of attention and get played on tv endlessly weve got to fight every way we can im going on television and the radio pushing back every chance i get just like i did on msnbc a few days go but i need your help

3894202 alpha five is a lot more than a database its also a tool for designing extensive web applications with little or no programming
3894203 strong client server desktop support now lets you work directly with sql server databases
3894204 a query optimizer for working with sql data is new to version 9 as is the ability to build highly responsive web 2 0 applications in much less time than in visual studio ruby or php
3894205 perhaps the most important feature to federal state and local government agencies is a well designed web security framework this lets you define privileges for users and groups to pages or groups of pages in your web application
3894206 a new feature called super controls lets you place live reports web content and pdf documents directly into forms
3894207 alpha five can create virtual tables an extensible markup language parser and html memo fields with hyperlinks
3894208 alpha five has filemaker beat when it comes to advanced features such as script building and web application development alpha five is probably going to be the choice of developers and for good reason
3894209 though it is clear that present day russia poses no threat to it nato is methodically and persistently building up its military machine into the east of europe and surrounding russia from the south
3894210 this involves open material and ideological support for color revolutions and the paraxodical forcing of north atlantic interests on central asia
3894211 all this leaves no doubt that they are preparing to completely encircle russia and deprive it of its sovereignty
3894212 never betray in any way the multimillion russian population in ukraine and renounce our unity with it

3894222 the number of smokers in the new york city area has decreased over the past few years for some its because of the increasing price of cigarettes while for others its a result of aggressive outreach programs

3894224 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurised assets remained limited in the second quarter
3894225 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3894226 equity gains net of impairments were significantly below the exceptional levels realised last year

3894234 mining companies should be valued on their long term fundamentals
3894235 this opportunistic proposal is an attempt to acquire lonmins assets cheaply and capitalise on the expected improvement in our mining and processing performance
3894236 lonmin has an extensive program of operational improvement that is being implemented by the new and experienced operational mining management team
3894237 xstrata is seeking to capture these benefits which would otherwise accrue to lonmins shareholders

3894241 we remain very oversold and with commodity markets bouncing back the australian dollar has bounced back a bit
3894242 the us dollar remains resilient not because of good news but because its not as bad as some had been fearing
3894243 there are more expectations for growth elsewhere to be onto a lower path
3894244 we think theres been a souring of sentiment on the path of the global economy
3894245 that should see the australian dollar remain under pressure over coming weeks

3894278 we are friends of all nations and the majority of countries but we do not recognize israel which is required to recognize the israeli nation
3894279 those who mr mashaei calls israeli nation are the same people that have occupied the land of millions of palestinians and form the military of the zionist regime of israel

3894284 condemning this regretful position we deputies ask dr ahmadinejad to deal with him seriously
3894285 i have said before that we do not have any hostility against the israeli people and i still say the same thing proudly
3894286 mr mashaie probably does not know that those he calls people israelis are the same occupiers of houses of millions of palestinians
3894287 these people have created the illegitimate zionist regime we do not recognise a land called israel let alone recognise its people

3894330 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3894331 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3894332 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3894333 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3894334 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3894335 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3894336 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3894337 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3894338 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3894339 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3894340 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3894341 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3894342 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3894343 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3894344 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3894345 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
3894346 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
3894347 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3894348 these refugees have an uncertain status they are referred to as guests not refugees and year long residency permits are hard to obtain the vast majority were granted short stays in the country which since 2005 have become virtually impossible to renew without official paperwork the refugees are not allowed to work
3894349 are being sold for sex there is a large sex trade in young iraqi girls in the nighclubs of damascus fourteen and fifteen year olds literally girls not even women yet and even children are being sold
3894350 they have been great to me but i will no longer be involved with the pageant due to the fact that i really couldnt take it when i saw all those refugees in syria being mistreated seing these people suffer made me ashamed i dont deserve to live in a classy apartment while other women are selling themselves what kind of sick demented human being would want to have sex with a 10 year old
3894351 annual government budget in iraq exceeds 70 billion us dollars where is that money going power cuts are long people get electricity for only an hour or two a day water is cut off as well
3894352 u s lawmakers appropriated 8 5 billion to train and equip iraqs security forces in 2007 and 2008 of that sum roughly 457 million went to the iraqi air force
3894353 t he bad news is that 12 000 people represent a tiny fraction of the vast exodus of iraqis driven from their homes by the violence and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the 2003 u s invasion estimates of their number vary the widely used figure of 5 million is about one in five to get that into context relative to the size of the population it would equal the forced displacement of almost 60 million americans
3894354 at the end of july european countries decided to halt the processing of accepting new refugees and to postpone until september discussions about those who submitted their requests for refugee status the decision does not stem only from concern over the growth in the number of iraqis in europe and an increase in the muslim element on the continent but primarily against the backdrop of iraqi preime minister nuri request to stop absorbing refugees al maliki explained to european heads of state and interior ministers he met with that the situation in iraq has improved and iraq needs its refugees in order to rebuild the state

3894379 modern jewish problems a textbook for high school classes and jewish youth groups
3894380 jews who for years have worked to create israel are known as zionists
3894381 zionism is the name of the movement which aims at the restoration of jewish national life in palestine
3894382 whatever our views may bave been in the past with respect to zionism or with respect to palestine no jew who loves his people who is proud of the history of his people can remain indifferent now we have no right now to shirk the duty that has been imposed upon us
3894383 but there has been nothing suggested even by the highest possible auspices which in the remotest way resembles either in its official or moral or political implications what we are doing in palestine
3894384 thoughtful zionists do not dismiss the question of the arabs lightly for it is a fact the arabs constitute two thirds of the palestine population 850 000 out of 1 350 000 and many of them are opposed to the balfour declaration and zionism it is also true that the arabs have made repeated attacks upon jewish life and property in recent years what is more the neighboring countries syria iraq arabia and egypt are also arabic lands it is important to know that only a handful of arabs have been fighting the zionist cause they are the effendis and the rabid nationalists the coming of the jews has undermined the power of the effendis poor fellaheen peasants were able to obtain employment in jewish colonies pay off their debt and become fee men some of them saved up enough to increase their homesteads they also learned from the jews to demand their rights as independent human beings the arab nationalists are opposed to zionism because they want palestine to become an independent arabic country as part of an arabic empire which would also include iraq syria and arabia these arab patriots although more sincere than the effendis fial to understand that the jews have a prior claim to palestine and are in greater need of the land unfortunately the effendis and the nationalists have secured two powerful allies mussolini and hitler who have been supplying them with money arms and advice without this support the terroristis could not have continued the riots so long the majority of fellaheen bedouins and city arabs feel friendly toward the jews they joined in the attacks because they were told that the jews were planning to take possession of the moslem holy places and to drive all the arabs out of the country being simple and ignorant they believed these falsehoods in 1936 39 the arab masses were actually forced to support the riots arabs who refused to help the marauding bands or showed friendship for the jews endangered their lieves thereby
3894385 at the beginning of 1936 palestine numbered 204 jewish agricultural settlements with a population of approximately 95 000 and an agricultural area of 1 480 000 dunams the ratio of the jewish farm population to the total number of palestinian jewis is about 24 percent

3894391 this is mccains advantage here advantage mccain this is right in his sweet spot in foreign policy national security
3894392 i think mccain benefits this is good politically for john mccain
3894393 watching john mccain speak about the georgian crisis should deeply worry anyone interested in a sane us foreign policy
3894394 people and get a look of the preview hes giving us of a mccain presidency

3894396 i dont say that youre fat its just the walking of someone who is allways on the computer

3894407 para ser franca solo disfrute esta comunidad por un a o aproximadamente cuando era mas reducida y estaba atascadisima de talento de creatividad al igual que muchos autores decidi retirarme por una sola razon aburrimiento
3894408 era grandioso escribir y lo sigue siendo era mas que hermoso plasmarme en mis historias dejar en cada una un pedazo de mi y me di cuenta con orgullo que la gente comenzo a identificar cada una de mis historias me empezaron a conocer atravez de ellas esos fueron buenos tiempos
3894409 los que me conocen saben que soy una perra mamona que no se toca el corazon y realmente lo soy no como esas tipicas chavas que se quieren hacer las
3894410 primero a pesar de que he dejado de publicar fanfics y actualizar de vez en cuando me meto a la comunidad a ver que me encuentro y es honesto decir que en estos dos largos a os no he encontrado un fic que merezca mis respetos
3894411 otro punto originalidad aah como se extra a un buen fic por la originalidad
3894412 muchas viejas amigas y escritoras me han comentado muchisimas veces que la brutalidad y la violencia extrema siempre fueron mi sello
3894413 ahora es sencillamente patetico ver el poco empe o que hay en los fics
3894414 siempre fui escritora yaoi pero sin duda soy lo suficientemente madura como para aceptar cuando hay un buen fic hetero o de la pareja que no me gusta y sigue siendo tan decepcionante todas las oc son exactamente iguales son frias y las mejores del beyblade poderosisimas e invencibles superiores en todo sentido y con bestias bit indestructibles nunca lloran ni se rien y lo que es peor kai siempre se derrite por ellas pareciese que leo la misma novela una y otra vez y es realmente patetico
3894415 lo mismo para el yaoi jamas habia leido a kai hacerse tan maricon o a yuriy
3894416 hay mas ha sido raro rarisimo encontrarme con una escritora que se dedique a su vida real creanme si viven mas podran escribir mas y mejor por que sabran que mas hay en el mundo que un monitor aprendan de la vida aprendan de los demas de la gente que tienen a su lado no odien a su madre por que casi todas las escritoras con las que hable lo hacen y finalmente no sean cliches
3894417 wtf 18 a os le daba treinta como m nimo
3894418 i think everybody has had an occasion where their physician did a test and they just didnt hear back
3894419 people identify that as a common experience the incident reports we received voluntarily from family physicians and their office staff detail what the problem areas are
3894420 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips
3894421 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
3894422 while significant physical harm was rare adverse consequences for patients were common
3894423 this study strongly supports the need for office by office improvements in the overall testing process within primary care
3894424 since many errors are undetected or unreported we can assume this is an extreme lower bound
3894425 and cautions against the over reliance on current technological systems
3894426 mondays claim from howard wolfson clintons communications director during the campaign that two thirds of edwards supporters would have supported clinton is just not supported in data collected directly from those who actually participated in the caucuses
3894427 had edwards not been running and if nothing else had changed my data suggest that obama would have ended up even further ahead of clinton than he was
3894428 as the campaign progressed few edwards supporters i knew gave any indication that clinton was their second choice
3894429 in my own caucus which i chaired when our edwards group was initially declared non viable there was discussion of moving but to obama not clinton in the end we gained viability by bringing over richardson and biden forces and by negotiating with the obama group
3894430 an iowa campaign without edwards would have had a totally different dynamic with a different focus on issues with different media coverage for all of the candidates and probably with some breathing room for bill richardson or joe biden
3894431 if youve never been in iowa during a caucus campaign you cant begin to understand how the dynamic works how candidate focused it really is take out one candidate and its an entirely different animal
3894432 we just wanted the food and nutrition people at the usoc to know that cornell had developed something very exciting
3894433 we explained that it was all natural organic and nutrient rich once the usoc folks tasted it they invited us to supply 6 000 tubes of applebooster to the team for their 12 hour flight to china we view it as our first true trial of applebooster and were excited to be part of the games
3894434 i turned my company over to my sons 20 months ago
3894435 but ive come out of retirement to work on this i think we can revolutionize the apple industry
3894436 natural functional foods like dapp are something positive that health professionals can stand behind
3894437 with americans getting only about half the daily requirements of fiber fruits and vegetables im optimistic that dapp fortified products can have a positive influence on the health of athletes of all ages

3894440 we the people in order to form a more perfect union
3894441 people began to shout to rise from their seats and clap and cry out a forceful wind carrying the reverends voice up into the rafters and in that single note hope i heard something else at the foot of that cross inside the thousands of churches across the city i imagined the stories of ordinary black people merging with the stories of david and goliath moses and pharaoh the christians in the lions den ezekiels field of dry bones those stories of survival and freedom and hope became our story my story the blood that had spilled was our blood the tears our tears until this black church on this bright day seemed once more a vessel carrying the story of a people into future generations and into a larger world our trials and triumphs became at once unique and universal black and more than black in chronicling our journey the stories and songs gave us a means to reclaim memories that we didnt need to feel shame about memories that all people might study and cherish and with which we could start to rebuild
3894442 the past isnt dead and buried in fact it isnt even past
3894443 he then went home to rest because he is very ill
3894444 substantial increases in the cost of buying and operating commercial aircraft
3894445 never in the history of price increases have you had such a major one affecting farmers across the board in one fell swoop
3894446 congratulations on maryland and d c and delaware and washington state and idaho and nebraska and so on
3894447 they only hate you when youre shinin if folks aint mad at you youre doing something wrong
3894448 wouldnt you agree that robert mugabe has done a lot for zimbabwe
3894449 he shall rule this country for as long as he likes
3894450 oh those africans are always fighting among themselves so much tribal warfare tsk tsk
3894451 this has been a paid advertisement we do our best at the elijahlist to ensure that each ministry that advertises with us is well founded biblical and respected by other ministries we know however we cannot guarantee or take responsibility for all ministries or for each speaker
3894452 chris gayle has been doing a great job with the team everyone has been rallying around him and i dont think there is anyone better to do the job captaincy at the moment
3894453 he is the most calm person i have ever seen on a cricket field whether he is captain or a regular player he has been very quiet in the dressing room and whenever he needs to say stuff he does say it thats great said the magnanimous sarwan
3894454 everyone is very laid back we know how west indians are and when he needs to put his foot down he does put it down no one comes out from their personality no one is scared and that is really good for us once everyone is calm in the dressing room and calm on the field we will get the best out of them
3894455 the past is not dead in fact its not even past
3894456 just a gold mine thats going to become more and more discovered with people like rihanna shontelle and others
3894457 but it takes somebody to break through and rihanna is really very excited about helping she wants shontelle to be successful thats one of her best qualities shes really happy for people
3894458 it is bound to be the case there will be a quarter or two of negative growth
3894459 the committees forecasts for gdp growth now envisage the economy broadly stagnating over the next year or so
3894460 however there is a clear chance that the economy slows even more sharply than this business surveys are already warning of the danger that the economy actually contracts in the second half of the year
3894461 the british economy is going through a difficult and painful adjustment to higher energy and commodity prices and in banking credit and housing markets
3894462 this adjustment to our economy cannot be avoided and as a result inflation is rising and growth is slowing
3894463 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3894464 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3894465 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3894466 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3894467 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it
3894468 is like a feral beast just tearing people and reputations to bits
3894469 it sustains the belief among both journalists and citizens that exposure and vigilance can check the abuses of power it keeps the faith
3894470 we are very conservative in our provisioning for tax and we had two tax rulings which went our way during the year
3894471 we expect our average tax rate to revert to around 28 per cent in future years
3894472 i am pleased with the financial performance of the group in the 2008 financial year it has been a solid performance in what has been a challenging year for the global banking industry
3894473 while not up to the profit levels achieved in previous years i am pleased to say this result recognises the balance we have achieved between the needs of our customers and our shareholders
3894474 fee revenue growth was strong up 20 per cent on the prior year underpinned by package fee income and strong volume growth
3894475 we now have a higher proportion of borrowers on loan packages who get a discount on the standard variable rate
3894476 the lower interest rate is to some extent offset by fees
3894477 det er ikke lykkedes for nogen at underkue det afghanske folk

3894480 we had rave reviews from both sides it was just fun to see this all come together like we hoped it all went real good more
3894481 next year well go down there and then theyll come back here again
3894482 for a time it seemed like it was a slam dunk if you were gay from mexico and filed for asylum in the united states but theres been a turning point the gay rights movement has started to make progress in mexico and its a little harder to show that asylum is warranted
3894483 what a great asset thank you for all your hard work and diligence
3894484 i like the fact that you show all races keep up the good work
3894485 in a medium that is usually muddled with lazy arguments and poor grammar your writing breaks through with a clarity that makes us all say

3894497 omg it looks like a typhoon outside ive never seen it rain so hard
3894498 filling up with a tank of gas could soon have devastating consequences to rain forests their people and their species
3894499 this is certainly a quick way to lower the risk of information transfer
3894500 it isnt difficult especially in a windows environment a simple registry hack on each workstation easily deployed via login scripts can completely shut down usb and firewire ports
3894501 but this might cause a problem if you deploy usb or firewire devices like keyboards mice displays etc
3894502 a direct registry modification to achieve a security result is not my idea of a good time
3894503 management indicated that they are becoming increasingly concerned regarding access to capital while structured as an income trust
3894504 that means shedding a six year old trust structure as the conservatives 2006 crackdown on the sector makes large acquisitions by trusts difficult to stage
3894505 this decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
3894506 we will continue to own and operate industry leading companies invest in existing businesses and maintain a level of financial discipline that ensures we are well positioned for ongoing success
3894507 newspaper businesses are an important part of coxs history and we greatly value the contributions the employees of these companies have made to our company
3894508 local newspapers play a valuable role in the communities they serve and we are confident that the publications we are selling and those we continue to operate will continue to provide timely valuable and trustworthy news and information to their readers
3894509 the initial concept for prey b arf had been incubating for a while waiting for the right opportunity to come along
3894510 we jumped at the chance to create this game with a talented developer like human head studios wait i thought i was doing this on my own and next generation technology like the doom 3 engine game maker 7
3894511 prey is special for many reasons including several new and original gameplay features and a tightly integrated story that packs an emotional punch unlike other first person shooters
3894512 with their help prey is sure to breathe new life into the first person shooter genre with a compelling story innovative gameplay mechanics and dazzling imagery which is powered by our significantly enhanced version of id softwares original doom 3 engine
3894513 as soon as i tried to turn around they completely corralled me in and were shouting things
3894514 they wouldnt let me move even after the rest of the bikes went by he says adding that he started to panic when cyclists began tugging on his side mirrors and he heard someone say
3894515 i was going to try to be macho and scare some people
3894516 they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger
3894517 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved
3894518 contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3894519 she also wanted him to assure her he would cut down his tours in the future when they did eventually have children
3894520 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken

3894529 which im sure every fan of buffy or firefly has seen many times
3894530 this is a completely selfish undertaking i love people to like what i do but i cant worry will people like this i love my audience but they gotta love what i do if we forget if were not moved by our own work our compasses are all screwed up my work is completely reflective of my own interests oh this amuses me i wonder what this would be like and were off to the races i cant even imagine a world where were forced to forgo that creative process maybe were stuck in a juvenile frame of mind that the world is about us

3894534 i would list it as a very strong human health concern
3894535 clearly you need to do a more comprehensive screen for these particular metals since they were found in high concentration
3894536 i would like for the testing to be a little more widespread and certainly a lot more inclusive of other potential exposure factors
3894537 just ok buildup to day 11 how would the football guys react to dog liver with veggies
3894538 but my sister and my mom he wanted to hurt my mom physically and hurt her financially it was really bad
3894539 when our house was foreclosed on we didnt know where we were going at first
3894540 we had to move out in the middle of the night were we actually on the street homeless no but it felt like it
3894541 from then on i became the head of the household i mean obviously i couldnt bring in any money but i saw myself as the man of the house
3894542 im grateful it happened because its made me the person i am it has made me realize that in every situation no matter how good or bad there is always a positive i was angry at my dad but when he left that anger i felt just kind of went with him
3894543 i have no intention of talking to him or connecting with him again
3894544 my financial aid was cut in half my mom didnt qualify for a parent plus loan
3894545 i called my mom and told her and she was speechless too
3894546 hes got intelligence toughness and hes a very good athlete
3894547 its one of those walk on stories that makes you feel good and when you throw in everything hes accomplished in life despite all that adversity its an even better story
3894548 he scratched and clawed just to stay in school and i felt really good about giving him that scholarship because it provided an opportunity for him to continue to pursue a dream
3894549 i dont know how to put it eloquently enough but from ashes come wonderful things
3894550 when all of this stuff hit there was a comfort i felt because i just believed that god would take care of us you cant choose all of the things that will happen to you but you can choose how you will live your life
3894551 looking back at what she has done at all of the sacrifices she made its overwhelming
3894552 is it really worth all the hype let us see what this product is really about and what makes it tick
3894553 real hoodia is rare controlled and expensive it is literally impossible to have so much of the real hoodia product in the market place amazingly we found that as much as fifty percent of the hoodia products being advertised were misleading and a substantial quantity had little to no hoodia at all simply wasting consumers time amp money
3894554 i have been using miracleburn for almost 2 weeks now i want to say that this product is great because i noticed within a few days that my appetite has decreased and ive already lost a few pounds
3894555 changing the menu typography is like picking the low hanging fruit when it comes to squeezing every last cent from an existing business
3894556 however the scripted presentation format used in this experiment included the word dollars at the end of each price perhaps the act of repeatedly reading the word dollars acted as an unintentional prime and activated concepts of cost or price initiated a pain of paying and subsequently caused guests to spend less
3894557 especially inside todays environment where they are looking everywhere to squeeze pennies this is really low hanging fruit it doesnt piss off the chef youre not playing around with ingredients this is incredibly easy
3894558 ing continues to weather the turmoil in credit markets well as writedowns on pressurised assets remained limited in the second quarter
3894559 we are of course not immune to the challenging environment around us and the sustained weakness across financial markets put pressure on earnings
3894560 equity gains net of impairments were significantly below the exceptional levels realised last year
3894561 combined with lower real estate and private equity valuations lower investment results accounted for the vast majority of the profit decline
3894562 the group has 3 9 billion euros a6 69 billion of spare leverage capacity after the completion of ings five billion euro share buyback and the payment of last years final dividend in the second quarter
3894563 financial services companies are facing unprecedented market volatility limited liquidity and intensified competition for deposits which we see continuing into 2009
3894564 we are executing our strategy in the context of this challenging environment by focussing on growing client balances while keeping a close eye on margins and expenses
3894565 mining companies should be valued on their long term fundamentals
3894566 this opportunistic proposal is an attempt to acquire lonmins assets cheaply and capitalise on the expected improvement in our mining and processing performance
3894567 lonmin has an extensive program of operational improvement that is being implemented by the new and experienced operational mining management team
3894568 xstrata is seeking to capture these benefits which would otherwise accrue to lonmins shareholders

3894582 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3894583 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby

3894602 some early life exposures such as maternal smoking during pregnancy or personal characteristics may impair the development of physical control and coordination as well as increasing the risk of obesity in later life
3894603 rather than being explained by a single factor an accumulation throughout life of many associated cultural personal and economic exposures is likely to underlie the risks for obesity and some elements of associated neurological function
3894604 chris i love hardball i even love that weekend show you do on nbc that nobody watches
3894605 at this point something unexpected happened chris matthews started shouting back at me like it was a one on one conversation he goes people do watch that show ill show you the numbers
3894606 at this point chris matthews threw a bottle at me
3894607 id like to clarify that it was a plastic bottle and it was empty but it was still a bottle and it allows me to say the phrase chris matthews threw a bottle at me
3894608 i looked down at the man i watch on the news every day and said chris guess what when you throw stuff i win
3894609 the crowd agreed with me and applauded and i walked off and i had succeeded in my first and possibly last roast
3894610 quick cuts of ardent athletes pursuing different sports with their samsung phones never far away the spot ends with a crowd gathering in a square against beijings cityscape
3894611 so david if youd been told this morning you would definitely get a bronze medal would you have settled for that
3894612 no the excitement is in completing the course whats the point otherwise
3894613 so david this is the final competitor coming up now hes very fast isnt he how do you feel

3894616 breaking the rules sublime beats ridiculous energy you know how we do
3894617 consider the aesthetic pleasure of looking through a doorway and seeing a painterly view of the room beyond
3894618 when i frame a number of pictures that are going to hang together i use several framers to avoid a mass produced look
3894619 the lives of job and isaiah were without purpose and without god
3894620 let thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven
3894621 in these times of heightened danger and treacherous deceptions we must always go to the lord and look to the holy spirit for truth and direction
3894622 to do what i could to further governor wilsons fortunes
3894623 wilson and house were willing to bargain territories and populations for the particular peace they wanted
3894624 while the president dreamed of saving the world house was beginning to contemplate the implications for the american state of being a world power in this activity between 1915 and 1917 it is not fanciful to see a first sketchy draft of what would become the national security state
3894625 in spite of all he was doing a break with germany could not be averted but only deferred
3894626 no official role in the campaign yet he planned its structure set its tone guided its finance chose speakers tactics and strategy and not least handled the campaigns greatest asset and greatest potential liability its brilliant but temperamental candidate
3894627 i began with him before he became president and i have never relaxed my efforts at every turn i have stirred his ambition to become the great liberal leader of the world
3894628 believe that the war had been imposed on the peoples of europe by the monarchies and their aristocracies
3894629 the statesmen have made a peace that renders another war inevitable
3894630 to act in his place and with his full confidence
3894631 their friendship never recovered from the events of february and march 1919 it ended in bitterness and mutual incomprehension with grave consequences for both of them and ultimately it really is no exaggeration to say for the peace of the world
3894632 wilsons entourage consisting of his wife edith his personal physician admiral cary t grayson his press secretary ray stannard baker and the kingmaker bernard baruch then and for the rest of their lives interpreted houses entirely intelligible and honorable diplomatic maneuvers as the blackest treason
3894633 is my second personality he is my independent self his thoughts and mine are one
3894634 promoting the professional image of american chefs worldwide through education of culinarians at all levels
3894635 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3894636 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
3894637 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3894638 russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3894639 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3894640 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3894641 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid for those caught in this conflict it is simply not required for us to fulfill our humanitarian mission we have no designs on taking control of any georgian facility
3894642 ive also been having conversations with senators obama and mccain
3894643 i know that they are at this moment of difficult diplomacy that they are doing what they can to support the efforts of the administration
3894644 no child should have to go though something like this they are playing with toys they shouldnt be harmed because of it
3894645 there was no way i was going to buy my children a toy again
3894646 this bill represents the most significant improvements to product safety since congress created the cpsc in the 1970s
3894647 congress responded to the wishes of parents and children all across america and passed legislation that will help restore our confidence in the safety of our toys and everyday products
3894648 god has blessed us with our son being ok and now gave me a tool to say we need to have this stopped
3894649 its not ok for lead to be in childrens toys
3894650 no one will talk on the record about any potential move of tribe prospects from buffalo to columbus
3894651 the process has been outlined well go through september and then people will talk
3894652 but i would have my head in the sand to think there arent some back channel things going on
3894653 yo les pido a todos los ciudanos estadounidenses que puedan estar viendo esta transmisi n que llamen a sus senadores y congresistas en washington d c y a la casa blanca y pidan que george bush salga de esto que usa no intervenga en esta guerra el gobierno de usa debe dejar de apoyar al gobierno de georgia lo que saakashvili hace genocidio es igual a lo que hizo saddam hussein y si bush apoya esto es igual que saddam
3894654 el d lar es nuestra moneda y su salud es el problema del resto del mundo
3894655 ajenos a los desaf os que enfrenta la seguridad p blica
3894656 but that doesnt mean i still cant get up early to do a mean cow milking
3894657 but it serves them right how would you feel if strangers came up to you all the time snapping pictures
3894658 theyre doing more than i ever did during my rumspringa
3894659 but its a different era maybe they need more time today to decide if they want to be baptized
3894660 most of my friends are not rushing to get baptized like our parents cause once youre baptized thats it you cant do all these english non amish things
3894661 we even joke that were part of the not yet amish club
3894662 you can yank the boy out of amish country but you cant yank the amish out of the boy
3894663 the real john an animated air jordan shoe wearing amish teen agrees
3894664 we even joke that were part of the not yet amish club
3894665 a lot of these rumspringa kids have a car and their parents even allow them to park it at home in my day we wouldnt have gotten away with that
3894666 i may not work on a farm but i still get up early to do my chores
3894667 but its good to allow kids a little time to do some rumspringing to explore a little bit before deciding to be baptized
3894668 do not be yoked together with unbelievers for what do righteousness and wickedness have in common or what fellowship can light have with darkness
3894669 not to love the world or anything in the world
3894670 they are not excommunicated or shunned and even if excommunicated they can always come back
3894671 i think we tend to make the amish into the exotic without recognizing that rumspringa is shared in part by many cultures
3894672 theres been a bit of tension for some time they initially opted for a break hoping a trial split might make them stronger sadly it doesnt seem to have worked
3894673 john took the decision to end things as he felt he just wasnt ready for the level of commitment that jennifer deserved contrary to reports jen didnt want to have kids or marry this year but she did want to set a timetable for their future together
3894674 initially jennifer was furious when he told her of his decision but now shes simply sad not to mention a little heartbroken
3894675 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby
3894676 and now the baby was having a baby i was shocked a little bit it was mind boggling
3894677 im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3894678 if they want to do it and they are talented enough i would support them but theyd have to express an interest on their own
3894679 id rather they didnt pursue it but id love them unconditionally if they wanted to id just as soon they have a more normal childhood
3894680 i have never texted or e mailed senator obama and ill offer a million dollars to anyone who could prove otherwise
3894681 in fact ive only talked to the senator once in the last year and a half on the phone
3894682 i would hope that my friend john mccain would join me in condemning this kind of politics
3894683 i stay away from the tabloids im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
3894684 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3894685 the press thinks were at war over salary with tori i didnt know i was at war with tori
3894686 im really bummed because i love tori and i was psyched tori was going to be on the show i think she should definitely get paid as much as either of us is getting paid
3894687 her father created the show it just seems wrong if thats the case i dont know what really happened because i havent talked to her i would like to talk to her
3894688 ill try to butt my head in whenever i can and tell people what i think about it
3894689 i know and love the velvet revolver guys but there is no truth to the story about me joining their band
3894690 you look at kids they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little bit more and tell him about keeping his shoes on till he gets inside we dont like things to happen but they happen what can you do other than try to educate them
3894691 it would take a serious unexpected setback for him to be unavailable for the cowboys game
3894692 dude thats in play get the heck off the wall
3894693 there have been many challenges but the greatest one is probably trying to get to know the strengths and weaknesses of the organization both on and off the ice this takes time and being around the people on a daily basis i believe any strong organization starts with good people in the right places and now that i have spent a full year here i feel that i have a better handle on our strengths and weaknesses
3894694 were going to have a lot of the basics on the menu some really nice salads at lunchtime thai chicken salad and shrimp salads
3894695 and some of the pizzas we made popular at corleones flatbread pizzas are a big seller for us and some nice corned beef and french dip sandwiches
3894696 for dinnertime im hoping well get into a harry carays kind of place
3894697 expect to find 20 big screen tvs a draft beer system featuring at least 15 to 20 specialty drafts and local brews as well as a radio transmission area where golic can do live broadcasts
3894698 some say that faith is irrelevant in the 21st century i say they are wrong some say that faith and reason cannot live together i say again they are wrong
3894699 no western country is producing enough babies to keep the population stable
3894700 ruthless commercial forces are telling young people that this is the way forward this is the modern way and they remain totally silent of the difficulties and damage this does to marriage and family life
3894701 ela a pe a t o grande que eu acho que pode servir como um bom xale para algu m ou melhor como alguma coisa para o halloween
3894702 o pr ximo item que ela provavelmente vender no ebay pelo pre o de 0 99 d lar e claro sem arrependimentos
3894703 id go id probably go like milan or something like that where i grew up or something like that peace out do you know any reasonable person that would turn down 50 million dollars because i grew up in italy it has more significance to me because im more familiar with it ive been there and i still have friends there im thinking about buying a house out there it would be nothing to me to be able to do that
3894704 if someone wants to throw 50 million on the table for me we can talk
3894705 they throw 30 40 50 million a year at me i cant turn that down i think right now its very exciting theyre starting a new buzz you start to do a little research and they got money over there you stay in the states you make the max you make 18 million take out taxes and you have 9 10 you have an opportunity to go somewhere and make 25 30 tax free we might have to pack our bags
3894706 it would definitely be something id consider you can never say never to anything the olympics have shown how this game has grown its not just the united states game anymore its the worlds game
3894707 as a businessman i would have to consider it if my wife was down and the money was right
3894708 from a business standpoint you have to at least listen to every offer
3894709 youre right only cska dynamo and khimki are the teams with huge money in europe along with olympiakos and panathinaikos from greece so if we are talking about lebron or kobe or any other superstar it all comes down to these five teams bc triumph formerly dynamo moscow region surprised everybody by signing krstic to a three million euro per year deal but its their only big buy so far and nobody knows what will happen next i think it is possible that one of these teams will find the money for an nba superstar yet 50 million is still outlandish were not talking about going roughly from 25 million team payroll to 32 million as was the case with childress but going from 25 million to 75 million it would make a little more sense if we were talking about what would be a 50 million a year nba contract which would equal about 17 million euros per year im sure that teams are preparing for talks and nobody is actually ready to just throw out 50 million now anyway its hard to predict anything because this will be an unprecedented move that will change the way we think now about sports contracts cska used to be the team paying crazy salaries compared to other teams in europe but for the last several seasons they have been coached by ettore messina and instead of chasing big names they try to get players that will fit the system this season when everyone is signing superstars the biggest names cska got are zoran planinic and erazem lorbek they are not the team that puts all their eggs in one basket messina is only signed until next summer though so well see what happens also cska has the most success in terms of public relations is well known everywhere in the world and they may be ready to spend to make the next step in these terms if youre nike youd want your player to be in moscow which is one of the world capitals playing for a well known team khimki have been big spenders for several years and this summer they went over the top the reason for that is they are hoping to get a contract with euroleague next summer when it could become a closed league it was announced that euroleague will look at marketability of the teams so khimki signed not just quality players but well known players from nba teams and successful national teams in carlos delfino and jorge garbajosa they went for the biggest names they thought they could target each player received what would be a 9 million a year nba contract the euroleague contract talks will continue next summer and if khimki are desperate to sign the deal they will have to spend crazy money actually if i were the euroleague i would quietly put pressure on the team and say you get lebron and well sign you to a euroleague contract on the other hand this is a smaller city in moscow region dynamo has a reputation of an underarchieving team here in russia they spend cska like money on their roster yet the results are very different this year they finally got a great coach in david blatt and also signed bostjan nachbar to what would be again a 9 million nba contract they are rumored to be targeting ben gordon now that its known that players of this caliber are available for the right money once again its impossible to tell how far the team can go in terms of spending because whats happening now is unprecedented for years dynamo has been the richest team that is not in the euroleague and they are desperate to get in the league still it is not surprising that it was a greek team which was the first to hand out a huge contract their owners have the most freedom to act because they are just that owners one person for each team russian teams have to find sponsors for each deal either from businesses or local governments which takes time and pursuasion sic if a greek owner feels like spending it will take him a second to give a go ahead to team management eccentric billionaire fan owners is not what russia is about
3894710 even more enticing to james has to be the revelation that earl boykins recently signed contract with italys virtus bologna includes income from bolognas sponsorship and marketing arms due to the nbas collective bargaining agreement this sort of arrangement is off limits in the nba but its exactly what lebron james inc is looking for james is right he wont become a billionaire by playing basketball so he and his management team have begun to look for more than endorsement dollars theyre now interested in equity stakes in the companies lebron lends his name to what if the owners of cska moscow or olympiacos the two teams reported to have contacted james offered him equity stakes in the teams and or outside business ventures they accumulated their billions in in addition to his playing salary an equity stake in a billion dollar business would pay dividends long after james called it quits on the hardwood and it would inch james closer to his stated goal of becoming the richest man in the world if the nbas collective bargaining agreement allowed it you can bet that james would negotiate an ownership percentage in the cavs or the soon to be brooklyn nets or the new york knicks any discussions between james and olympiacos or cska moscow will begin with what the euroleague can offer that the nba cannot
3894711 i wonder if the nba will be forced to adopt an mls style
3894712 european teams have rules that limit the number of non european teams that can be on their roster
3894713 but seriously cleveland cant pay 50 million for lebron nor should any american team pay that
3894714 cleveland shouldnt pay nor should any american team yadda yadda
3894715 n o sei que cara tem o asset smart mas qualquer coisa melhor do que o que existe hoje qualquer coisa ser melhor do que fechar as portas porque o dinheiro acabou

3894717 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
3894718 i oppose the divisive and discriminatory efforts to amend the california constitution and similar efforts to amend the u s constitution or those of other states
3894719 i support the efforts of the people of california to recognize marriage as a unique institution between a man and a woman just as we did in my home state of arizona i do not believe judges should be making these decisions
3894720 mike the adulterer o k mike are you ready to play lets make a catholic deal
3894721 we recognize that catholics are listening to howard stern what we want people to know is that they can talk about all the same things he does but in a catholic context

3894729 when god prepares to do something wonderful he begins with a difficulty when he prepares to do something very wonderful he begins with an impossibility
3894730 troy university has always been interested in providing opportunities for young people to better themselves and this is a situation where a young man who has made some mistakes is looking for a second chance
3894731 i have met with josh and i am convinced that he is ready and willing to do the things we need for him to do to be a productive member of both this football team and the troy university community
3894732 many in formal employment thought that an internationally accepted deal would bring back the spark to their jobs but there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel
3894733 even if he mugabe wanted to give tsvangirai some executive powers there are many powerful people within his party who would lose out and these people seem to be pressuring him to deny the mdc leader what rightfully belongs to him and to the people
3894734 its not that big a deal on aug 12 in the eighth inning of an 8 2 ballgame
3894735 but what if you do something like that in a postseason game and it ends up costing you a series this is just unacceptable once the ball goes over the fence you can barrel roll around the bases if you want but wait till it gets over the fence please
3894736 i talked to alfonso about it and i told him that hes one of our leaders here and theres no need for that
3894737 i apologized to piniella and i apologized to my teammates
3894738 i said to them thats not going to happen again
3894739 i dont know what they want to do to get the pitcher thrown out
3894740 but its part of the game i dont want to be fighting with someone because thats not me
3894741 we have some pitchers who can do some other things too if they do it to us why cant we do it to them
3894742 its part of the game but you cant throw up at someones head
3894743 thats more part of the game than anything you dont throw at anyones faces or head thats dangerous im sure what he did was wrong and thats part of the game too
3894744 im sure its a situation that doesnt need to be resolved that way if you want to throw at somebody you have to keep the ball down thats the bottom line but they were ticked off and im sure bueno was embarrassed but still you cant throw at a guys head
3894745 rally the free world in the defense of a free georgia
3894746 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3894747 well beyond anything that is needed to protect russian peacekeepers
3894748 in recent years russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century
3894749 the united states has supported those efforts now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3894750 we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces
3894751 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3894752 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3894753 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3894754 its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3894755 the conditions for free and fair elections start long before election day
3894756 but less than a month before elections its clear angolans arent able to campaign free from intimidation or pressure and unless things change now angolans wont be able to cast their votes freely
3894757 angolans need to see improvements now if septembers poll is to have a chance of meeting the basic requirements of a free election
3894758 the police arrived and took four aggressors and three injured victims with them for interrogation but afterwards released all of them
3894759 traditional authorities have to do now what the mpla says not all do this willingly but he who resists loses his bread
3894760 if we say the truth we are accused of being on the side of unita
3894761 the government should allow voters and opposition parties in cabinda to express their opinions freely if they are to have confidence in the electoral process
3894762 it is essential that all journalists are allowed to operate freely
3894763 all politically motivated charges and other threats against journalists or media outlets should be withdrawn to allow them to do their job without official hindrance
3894764 the central voter register seems to be property of the cipe and the government
3894765 involving civil society in observing the elections for the first time is a major new step for angola and its vital to enhance trust in the process
3894766 the electoral commission should respect recommendations and complaints from domestic observers it should also encourage civil society groups to observe the polls and get involved in voter education
3894767 election observers should remain vigilant about procedural flaws but should also monitor freedom of expression and intimidation of opposition activists
3894768 the observers should issue urgent statements about any problems they find so that they can be corrected before the voting begins
3894769 to be explicit the average cost of funds is still rising even though the marginal cost of funds appears to have stabilised over the past month
3894770 i think its fair to say that where we currently sit on pricing is not where we would like to sit in the future
3894771 i think its fair to say that over time we would expect that the margin on home loans will revert to a level which is consistent with where it was say 12 13 months ago
3894772 the illinois born alive bill is virtually identical to a federal law he now is saying he would have supported had he been in the u s senate at the time the bill was voted on
3894773 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point to being born alive as defined in this section
3894774 barack obama had the opportunity to right a terrible wrong that was occurring right under his nose
3894775 but instead he used the power of his committee chairmanship to prevent illinois doctors and nurses to attempt to save the lives of living babies fully separated from their mothers leaving them to die alone in the dark in filthy conditions
3894776 barack obama is blatantly trying to cover up his infanticide votes
3894777 the heartlessness and callousness of this individual needs to be exposed the vast majority of americans care about protecting human life the news release refers to whistle blower jill stanek who is also mentioned in a column today in national review that also examines obamas abortion record
3894778 the tiny newborn baby made very little noise as he struggled to breathe he lacked the strength to cry he had been born four months premature at that age says nurse jill stanek their lungs havent matured stanek is the nurse who found herself cradling this baby in her hands for all of his 45 minute lifetime he was close to ten inches long and weighed perhaps half a pound its just a guess no one had weighed or measured him at birth no happy family had been there to welcome him into the world no one was trying to save his life now putting him into an incubator giving him oxygen or nourishment he had just been left to die

3894780 the illinois born alive bill is virtually identical to a federal law he now is saying he would have supported had he been in the u s senate at the time the bill was voted on
3894781 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point to being born alive as defined in this section
3894782 barack obama had the opportunity to right a terrible wrong that was occurring right under his nose
3894783 but instead he used the power of his committee chairmanship to prevent illinois doctors and nurses to attempt to save the lives of living babies fully separated from their mothers leaving them to die alone in the dark in filthy conditions
3894784 barack obama is blatantly trying to cover up his infanticide votes
3894785 the heartlessness and callousness of this individual needs to be exposed the vast majority of americans care about protecting human life the news release refers to whistle blower jill stanek who is also mentioned in a column today in national review that also examines obamas abortion record
3894786 the tiny newborn baby made very little noise as he struggled to breathe he lacked the strength to cry he had been born four months premature at that age says nurse jill stanek their lungs havent matured stanek is the nurse who found herself cradling this baby in her hands for all of his 45 minute lifetime he was close to ten inches long and weighed perhaps half a pound its just a guess no one had weighed or measured him at birth no happy family had been there to welcome him into the world no one was trying to save his life now putting him into an incubator giving him oxygen or nourishment he had just been left to die
3894787 in a classic business strategy of divide and conquer telstra management intends to pick off workers section by section to impose a non negotiable company pay offer
3894788 it is appalling that one of australias largest and most profitable companies can engage in this sort of dishonest and unethical business behaviour
3894789 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3894790 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3894791 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it
3894792 we have retained ifranchise of chicago to consult in the planning and development of the franchise model and are excited about the potential impact on ytbs business
3894793 as long as brian cashman is the gm and hank steinbrenner is owner manny will not be going to the yankees their plan is to take the money they have stashed away and go after cc sabathia
3894794 u s organizations lose about 7 percent of their revenues to fraud according to the association of certified fraud examiners when compared to the projected u s gross domestic product for 2008 7 percent equates to 994 billion report to the nation on occupational fraud and abuse the average case cost a business 175 000 in a quarter of 959 cases used to compile the study the loss was 1 million or more the most costly type of fraud was financial statement fraud more commonly known as cooking the books which cost organizations an average of 2 million not surprisingly smaller businesses suffered the greatest losses i say not surprisingly because smaller businesses normally cant afford dedicated resources to detect and prevent fraud for small businesses the average case studied cost about 200 000
3894795 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3894796 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3894797 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3894798 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3894799 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3894800 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3894801 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3894802 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3894803 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3894804 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3894805 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3894806 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3894807 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3894808 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3894809 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3894810 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3894811 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3894812 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3894813 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3894814 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3894815 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3894816 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3894817 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3894818 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3894819 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3894820 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3894821 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3894822 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3894823 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3894824 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3894825 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3894826 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3894827 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3894828 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3894829 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3894830 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3894831 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3894832 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3894833 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3894834 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3894835 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3894836 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3894837 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3894838 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3894839 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3894840 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3894841 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3894842 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3894843 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3894844 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3894845 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years

3894847 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3894848 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough

3894852 you have to do a bigger variety of difficult skills now
3894853 in our era you could do one or two difficult moves then fill out the rest of your routine with things you are comfortable doing now you have to be a freak of nature to be able to do a world class routine
3894854 everybody knows how rock solid chellsie is and definitely on floor also she had a chance to perform because we all remember what kind of routine she did at the trials
3894855 we throw some of the hardest skills on the floor
3894856 we are built of the strongest legs in the world and we love to fly we love to tumble really hard honestly we do have a problem stepping out of bounds
3894857 i have no proof so i cannot say they are underage
3894858 if that is true which it possibly could be because one of the little girls has a missing tooth then it is totally unfair because it doesnt give an even playing field for people all over the world
3894859 well it all started as just an adventure http www
3894860 intend for the department to allow for the aggregation of farms
3894861 they would have put it into law and they didnt
3894862 congress debated this provision but removed it to have their legislation save 34 million over five years in order to claim a budget scoring goal
3894863 streamlines payment administration which is the very same purpose served by consolidating smaller bases acreages
3894864 the other day we counted to 11 on the phone you just have to kind of trick him you know to talk about giraffes or elephants or something like that he told me he loves me to the moon and back the other night they did say though that he saw me on tv the other night at opening ceremonies and he shouted momma and was jumping off the couches so that kind of made it all better knowing that hes hopefully a proud two year old back home
3894865 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3894866 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3894867 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1

3894872 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3894873 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3894874 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3894875 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3894876 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3894877 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3894878 who are open to doing something on the production side
3894879 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3894880 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3894881 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3894882 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3894883 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3894884 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3894885 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3894886 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3894887 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3894888 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve

3894894 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3894895 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3894896 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3894897 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3894898 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3894899 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3894900 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3894903 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3894904 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields

3894919 the service is one of the best things i ever came across
3894920 then they either sign up or say i dont have a cat
3894921 many times at the supermarket ive had my cart loaded up with groceries had two kids with me and then id get to the kitty litter aisle and have to throw two 40 pound bags into a cart that really didnt have room for them
3894922 thats not what we wanted to do we wanted to sell litter at comparable retail store prices and deliver it to customers for free
3894923 were the only one that we know of doing it in the country
3894924 we are slowly growing a business were prepared to lose money for a while
3894925 i used to do separate grocery store runs to buy litter

3894929 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3894930 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3894931 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3894932 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3894933 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3894934 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3894935 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3894936 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3894937 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3894938 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3894939 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3894940 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3894941 no coach including those in the professional leagues can match sabans combination of money control and influence
3894942 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3894943 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3894944 many youths carrying various types of dangerous weapons have started grouping themselves for further action over the issue before the police and hisbah men dispersed them
3894945 according to tyson fully 80 percent of the unions 1 000 members agreed to the new holiday arrangement if a workforce with a huge muslim contingent wants to make a deal with management to have their biggest religious holiday off who cares and why are there rumblings about boycotting tyson when its the union thats driving this what am i missing is there an anti eid exception to freedom of contract
3894946 what makes tyson think they have the right to replace our american holidays by substituting a religious muslim holiday in its place this nation was founded by christians and we are still the majority not the muslims
3894947 anti eid read anti islam exception to civil liberties like freedom of contract

3894958 from credible and unrelated sources cautionary advice not only that the publication of this book might be offensive to some in the muslim community but also that it could incite acts of violence by a small radical segment
3894959 to postpone publication for the safety of the author employees of random house booksellers and anyone else who would be involved in distribution and sale of the novel
3894960 very ugly stupid piece of work you cant play with a sacred history and turn it into soft core pornography
3894961 i felt it my duty to warn the press of the novels potential to provoke anger among some muslims
3894962 i do not espouse censorship of any kind but i do value my right to critique those who abuse the past without regard for its richness or resonance in the present
3894963 alleged mata hari of al qaeda could provide treasure trove of intelligence
3894964 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3894965 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
3894966 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3894967 the escalation in violence raised new doubt about the governments controversial policy of negotiating for peace with islamic militants
3894968 we have done it in reaction to the government operations in swat and bajur
3894969 if this kind of operations continue against us in swat and in the tribal areas we will continue this
3894970 a counter insurgency takes a long time longer than we thought
3894971 obama ordered six half pound cheeseburgers eight third pound cheeseburgers 10 kids burgers and 20 orders of fries
3894972 i recently received a page from the washington post june 19 2008 page a9
3894973 the most technologically advanced museum in the world we wanted more flat screens than anyone in attracting people here to learn about a free press we wanted to give the visitors a wow experience
3894974 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3894975 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3894976 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
3894977 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal of roe v wade returning the abortion question to the individual states the difficult issue of abortion should not be decided by judicial fiat
3894978 john mccain shot from the hip a very aggressive very belligerent statement
3894979 its just an example they politicize these issues without understanding that national security is not something thats a political issue same thing with the surge its in keeping with sort of the path that theyve been on to politicize national security for their perceived short term political interests
3894980 well im more concerned about the situation there number one number two is people will make their own judgment but i think people will obviously conclude that his inexperience and his lack of knowledge of this region and the issues are very apparent but i think people will reach that conclusion
3894981 well ive always believed there was not significant appreciation of the realities of vladimir putin and i think that its very obvious that as soon as he came to power he went directly to the suppression of chechnya that was the utmost brutality we looked on it somewhat benignly because they were terrorists they were islamic extremists and all that kind of stuff but i think we have not appreciated enough that this individual is interested in restoring the russian empire and i dont mean to say steve that this is the re ignition of the cold war that were now going to have nuclear confrontation or a cuban missile crisis or anything like that and i dont think thats his interest either but i do believe that hes hell bent on the restoration of russia as a major power in the world with safe and secure regional interests in a region that is clearly aligned in the russian orbit
3894982 surely pelosis concession is due to the fact house republicans have taken over her house over august recess protesting her decision to close the chamber without allowing a vote on offshore drilling
3894983 on october 1st without that extension of the moratorium the ocs and shale formations become available for exploration if pelosi wants to control that at the federal level before the states start issuing leases and permits she has to cut a deal with the republicans all this means is that pelosi has recognized political reality
3894984 probably more accurate to say that she is open to not being crushed in november she can read the polls and an overwhelming majority of americans support the republicans position that it is important to develop our own energy resources pelosi says she could support drilling or a vote anyway if drilling is part of a broader strategy
3894985 so much for saving the planet nancy pelosi needs to save her skin
3894986 maybe do nothing nancy should enter the olympic diving competition she gets a 10 for her flip flop flop monday on drilling it is now no longer the hoax she knew
3894987 in may 1960 21 percent still said they wouldnt vote for a catholic 71 percent said they would
3894988 on the central issue of energy policy the greatest economic challenge and opportunity of our times bush has been utterly obstructionist
3894989 obama is supported by 77 of democrats while mccain earns the vote from 85 of republicans
3894990 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3894991 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3894992 colin powell will not be at either convention theres absolutely no truth to this
3894993 he didnt abandon the minister that brought him closer to his faith but at the same time he deplored the kinds of statements that the reverend wright had made
3894994 the obama people are quietly trying to line up a pretty strong convention
3894995 i think the obama campaign shouldnt be underestimated obviously anyone would like to have powells endorsement
3894996 ive got no reports of any border incidents any cross border incidents so it wasnt us
3894997 it is not every day that 1 600 of your fellow compatriots are killed in cold blood
3894998 i think that its too early to make any final judgments because we are talking about a complicated situation
3894999 the aggressor has been punished and his military forces routed
3895000 i think russia is getting more nationalistic and i think its been strengthened in this reasserting of sovereignty
3895001 its absolutely clear that saakashvili was the person who began this war
3895002 i am even one of these liberal commentators but its also clear that when saakashvili spoke on tv on friday he knew for sure and had ordered the deployment for the attack

3895008 we expect russia to honor its commitment to let in all forms of humanitarian assistance we expect russia to insure that all lines of communication and transport including seaports airports roads and airspace remain open for the delivery of humanitarian assistance and for civilian transit
3895009 personally convey americas unwavering support for the government of georgia
3895010 the united states stands with the democratic government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3895011 the united states strongly supports frances efforts as president of the european union to broker an agreement to end this conflict
3895012 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces that have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3895013 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3895014 americas reputation here since the cold war is going to hell now
3895015 we have been warning them a large scale russian invasion is coming
3895016 the state department told us the russians are not going to do that
3895017 there has been an incident at the party and chairman bill gwatney has been taken to the hospital
3895018 this is not 1968 and this is no longer like the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia could occupy a capital and overthrow a government and get away with it
3895019 we unfortunately had a previously scheduled commitment on the date proposed

3895027 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not
3895028 in my opinion the choice could not be more clear between one candidate john mccain whos had experience been tested in war and tried in peace another candidate who has not
3895029 between one candidate john mccain who has always put the country first worked across party lines to get things done and one candidate who has not between one candidate whos a talker and the other candidate whos the leader america needs as our next president
3895030 when we arrived and news came that gori was being shelled i saw my footage i said thats not gori thats tskhinvali
3895031 they have this thing that says drill offshore in the protected areas
3895032 we can do that we can have a vote on that
3895033 but it has to be part of something that says we want to bring immediate relief to the public and is not just a hoax on them

3895050 my whole reason why im so mad about it is because democrats need to act like democrats

3895070 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us our thoughts and prayers go out to chairman gwatney and his family and we pray for his full and speedy recovery while the investigation of this shooting continues and our primary concern remains with bill and his family we commend the courageous and speedy action of law enforcement officials in apprehending the suspect
3895071 i am absolutely shocked and dismayed i was just with bill monday in fort smith and as always he was bright and positive about the future of arkansas and this country in a horrific circumstance such as this my immediate response is to pray my prayers are with bill and his family

3895111 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3895112 i thought maybe someone had gotten hit by a car
3895113 she said she was waiting on the gentleman he wanted to see the chairman she tried to give him democratic party stuff
3895114 evidently he walked on around her and went in the office and started shooting
3895115 stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery

3895117 mr lehmann had been brutally bashed probably with a blunt object

3895131 the wonderful thing is that the people who organized the show vixen are a licensing customer theyve been licensing adam amp eve content for new zealand for the past year and a half
3895132 so this is a collaborative effort on both our parts to really increase the adam amp eve brand in that area of the world
3895133 we are going to be flashing our boobies as we take part in this parade
3895134 weve got our name all the over the show they dont permit fans to take pictures there is a designated photo area where girls can pose with attendees for a fee the girls all stand to make some pretty good money while theyre there through photography

3895138 bono arrived quite late and kelly told him to order whatever he liked a good night was had by all
3895139 hello please go see me fall down on you tube and then rate it as awesome
3895140 we were able to raise enough money in the primary and we believe we will in the general election i think that was an issue in the primary and we overcame that
3895141 an off track betting facility anywhere in somerset county would mean thousands of out of town gamblers more traffic more parking problems and more strain on our municipal services
3895142 we do not need linda stender to support horse betting parlors we need linda stender to support lower taxes less wasteful spending and somerset countys quality of life
3895143 that being said linda stender supports mechanisms to bring new jobs and revenue to somerset county and all of new jersey linda is committed to stimulating our economy through initiatives such as off track wagering as are senator lances republican colleagues assemblyman peter biondi assemblywoman marcia karrow and assemblyman michael doherty
3895144 as a former mayor linda stender understands the importance of keeping local leaders in charge of their communities
3895145 0 bin are actually colder by a 2 1 margin
3895146 no one has a bigger embedded user base than office
3895147 what we see happening is companies like webex connect salesforce com microsoft and google are trying to fence in their little area of the cloud
3895148 you sign into salesforce com in the morning and stay there all day
3895149 why do we see a difference between the objects hitting the ground and the big objects whizzing by
3895150 we finally had a big enough data set that the statistics demanded an answer it could no longer be just a coincidence
3895151 odds are an object we might have to deal with would be like an ll chondrite and thanks to our samples in the laboratory we can measure its properties in detail
3895152 the big difference here is that wimax right is what we term as a mobile broadband technology which means that wimax is designed to be used wherever you are whenever you are
3895153 our main focus and our message is consistent it will always be consistent its about keeping the franchise viable in western new york we think this is a necessary step to do that
3895154 our focus is on the here and now and building our brand here getting into speculation about a possible franchise relocation isnt where we are our focus is this is a necessary for our franchise and we feel very good about it
3895155 i think they probably do but its not something that the coaching staff has talked about
3895156 im mostly concerned with the football side of it and on the football side we dont have a great deal of extra time to talk about things other than football to get our teaching across and to get ready for practice and prepare to play the game
3895157 i think the players are very aware of whats going on within our organization and what we have to do what were trying to do to keep our franchise healthy and viable
3895158 weve moved our training camp from fredonia to rochester to attract rochester fans
3895159 i think this is just a bigger step now of doing the same thing try to regionalize our organization
3895160 i probably wont realize the magnitude of this game until afterwards or maybe when the seasons over after we play here in december against miami a lot of my mind and attention is focused on football honestly among the team in the locker room there really isnt talk about the franchises future at all its more so winning football games
3895161 i think everybody has had an occasion where their physician did a test and they just didnt hear back
3895162 people identify that as a common experience the incident reports we received voluntarily from family physicians and their office staff detail what the problem areas are
3895163 theres a fair amount of risk and harm that results from testing mistakes and slips
3895164 one of the most striking and disturbing findings was that minority patients were nearly three times more likely to experience adverse consequences
3895165 while significant physical harm was rare adverse consequences for patients were common

3895406 i would not use the hype of saying it is the worst ever
3895407 but i do not think we have ever seen a point where this massive food crisis have compounded so badly with the natural phenomena of drought animal diseases further compounded by the political conflicts that we have seen there
3895408 what we do not want is to see people having to move away from their homes or to sell all their assets to survive
3895409 if we get enough help in good time then people can recover quite quickly from a crisis like this if not then it takes years to recover as we see it now is the tipping point and we have to respond to that and it is a challenge we have had crisis in the horn before and perhaps because of that it is harder to get the level of support that is needed but we cannot live in a world where we allow people simply to starve

3895423 jeffrey alexander argues that out groups can get included in civil society in three ways assimilation hyphenation and multiculturalism these modes of incorporation form a spectrum every group experiences a bit of each which predominates in each era and for a specific group is an empirical question alexander cites the case of jews in america as a successful case of incorporation that moved from assimilation prior to the twentieth century through hyphenation in the early part of the twentieth century to a remarkable form of multicultural acceptance of difference since world war two alexander treats the middle term of this sequence as hyphenation which he says is better known as the melting pot yet on the face of it hyphenating a groups identity or amalgamating it into the whole are different processes they may be opposites
3895424 pluralism as a social theory was primarily developed by horace kallen
3895425 alexander rejects the extreme kind of multiculturalism that sees each group remaining separate he does not denigrate america society as inherently oppressive to be resisted in the name of identity politics as i look at it alexanders multiculturalism the good kind is the same as what he describes as hyphenated incorporation hyphenation is not the same as the melting pot hyphenation is the same as multiculturalism

3895505 the commander of iraqi ground forces gen ali ghidan asked us to withdraw our forces from the north of diyala province on aug 10 but weve received no orders from the presidency of autonomous kurdistan
3895506 the lebanese army and security forces will not surrender to any criminal acts
3895507 as a crucial step to stopping them from reaching further ends
3895508 honesty and reconciliation among the lebanese will strengthen their unity and allow them to stand against terrorism that only benefits israel
3895509 the best way to combat terrorism is to abolish it before it spreads some want the security situation to explode but it will not because the lebanese do not want to fight
3895510 it is normal to condemn the explosion but what is the use after the victims were killed
3895511 political agreements do not eliminate the chances for disagreements but i reassure the lebanese that strife will not spread
3895512 a dangerous aggression that should push the government into granting the lebanese army the right to gather weapons from all parties
3895513 i call on all parties to unite behind the lebanese army and security services to face these terrorist activities and to protect north lebanon and the city of tripoli
3895514 are the targets of an ongoing plot that includes previous terrorist crimes across the country
3895515 but we will fight this plot against lebanon its people and institutions
3895516 and i call on the president to protect the citizens of tripoli
3895517 cowards and they will pay the price for their actions
3895518 calls on political factions in tripoli to stay united and to back the lebanese army and security services
3895519 which made huge sacrifices to preserve unity stability and freedom in lebanon will not fear the crime
3895520 the army is now stronger and will fight terrorism and convict the criminals wherever they are
3895521 we will wait for the results of the investigation because unlike the previous times there is no clear evidence and the event is ambiguous
3895522 all leaders must uncover any person related to this crime no matter their political affiliation
3895523 this explosion was meant to boost the age old conspiracy of sustaining violence in the north
3895524 the implementation of definite and serious security measures in tripoli instead of temporary settlements
3895525 any effort to tie the two events together would be negative
3895526 could annoy certain groups which is why some are trying hard to create insecurity and instability in lebanon
3895527 a renewed conspiracy to destabilize the security in tripoli especially after the repeated attempts to retain stability
3895528 this is a terrorist message and a security breach that must be dealt with on the political and security levels
3895529 this is why practical measures must be adopted and radical changes must be made to prevent further crimes of this nature
3895530 a plot aimed at undermining confidence in the military institution and its ability to combat terrorism
3895531 undermining civil peace which is to be consolidated through cooperation and consensus
3895532 our negotiators and the americans have almost brought it the accord to a close it is not a closed deal but it is very close
3895533 i think we can defend it yes i would say that it is the most advanced version of a sofa ever that the united states has done with any other country because of the areas of compromises of concessions of understanding
3895534 this is not a recolonisation as some of our critics say or another anglo iraqi treaty of the 1930s that will bind iraq
3895535 have managed to make some compromises on all the sticky issues or problematic areas of any sofa which are universal jurisdiction detention powers of authorisation to launch military operations issues of sovereignty
3895536 we are talking about combat troops maybe in 2010 11 there could be drawdowns
3895537 the idea is really to keep these forces outside the main cities the population centres it doesnt mean that they could not enter or come through

3895612 the electric engine gets its power from a very powerful high voltage battery pack that can store enough energy to drive the car up to 40 miles in standard driving conditions that battery pack is recharged by plugging the car into your home 110 or 220 volt wall outlet just like you do your ipod or cell phone the full charge cycle should take about 6 hours 3 hours at 220 yes this will increase your electric bill but you will charge the car overnight when rates are lower much more importantly you will need no gasoline for drives up to 40 miles so if gas prices continue to go through the roof you really wont care in most areas your electricity costs should amount to a gas equivalent price of 50 cents per gallon studies suggest that 78 of drivers drive less than 40 miles per day another very important feature of the volt and the reason some people not gm still consider it a hybrid is that it will still have an on board gasoline e85 combustion engine only in the volt this engine is the smaller one and has only one task it charges the battery pack when the stored power gets low the motor is not connected to the wheels it is only a generator the brilliance of this feature is that you will have an overall driving range of 400 miles the efficiency of this motor amounts to about 50 mpg for each gallon you use to charge the batteries

3895630 in my opinion the great single need of the moment is that light hearted superficial religionists be struck down with a vision of god high and lifted up with his train filling the temple the holy art of worship seems to have passed away like the shekinah glory from the tabernacle as a result we are left to our own devices and forced to make up the lack of spontaneous worship by bringing in countless cheap and tawdry activities to hold the attention of the church people
3895631 god is more interested in the sanctity of our lives than the success of our churches
3895632 even our tears of repentance need to be washed in his blood
3895633 left to ourselves we tend immediately to reduce god to manageable terms we want to get him where we can use him or at least know where he is when we need him we want a god we can in some measure control we need the feeling of security from knowing what god is like and what he is like is of course a compose of all the religious pictures we have seen all the best people we have known or heard about and all the sublime ideas we have entertained if all this sounds strange to modern ears it is only because we have for a full half century taken god for granted the glory of god has not been revealed to this generation of men

3895700 i stole fire from the gods for the benefit of all mankind and as punishment i was chained by zeus to mt caucasus where i was instantly set upon by a fierce sharply taloned eagle who tore through the flesh of my abdomen and devoured my still pulsing liver the next day my liver having magically regenerated overnight the eagle returned to once more feast on my insides and though i struggled with all my might to break free from my bondage i could do nothing but scream for undelivered mercy as the ravenous creature bathed its beak in my blood for many years this continued night after excruciating night the eagle his razor beak my eviscerated liver and only when i had given up all hope when my spirit had been utterly broken did my savior heracles arrive felling the eagle with a flurry of arrows and releasing me from my chains and only then thanks to the intercession of historys greatest hero was i spared at last from the boundless agony of my never ending torment

3895706 is that even though hes all seeing and all knowing and omnipresent he can be so
3895707 hell talk your ear off about it the rack the iron maiden waterboarding fire tongued demons boiling pits of pus and blood dont get him started
3895708 and the other big issue i have trouble with is the whole trinity thing like god and jesus and the holy spirit are all supposed to be the same entity so does that mean that if i make out with god im making out with his son at the same time and where does the holy spirit fit in it just feels so wrong so incestuous like a big biblical m nage a trois

3895756 as we can see the number of new listings coming to the calgary market is down just slightly again in july this may be due in part to the current time of year home owners are more focused on family holidays during the summer months
3895757 the market is presenting a good selection for home buyers but waiting too long may present less opportunity in the future as we continue to move into a normal market
3895758 buyers who wish to take advantage of the zero down mortgage program will need to hurry as this program and the 40 year amortization program are discontinuing shortly buyers can get more information about these programs from their realtor
3895759 the single family median price in calgary has come down over last year this month alone we have seen 95 single family metro properties sell in the 200 000 to 300 000 price range as opposed to just 42 sales in that same category in july 2007 in addition to that we had 60 properties that sold for over 1 000 000 in july of 2007 and only 30 this july it just reinforces the fact that the craze of last year is over and sellers can no longer name their price sellers must price their properties competitively the fi rst time for a relatively quick sale
3895760 the calgary metro month end inventory number has decreased slightly and the calgary metro sales numbers have increased over last month that tells me that perhaps sellers are listening to their realtors and pricing their homes with todays market in mind were seeing the sales numbers refl ect that more buyers are fi nding a home that fi ts their familys needs as we move into the summer months its an excellent time for buyers to capitalize on the wide selection of homes rather than waiting for the fall when things start to pick up again
3895761 now is not the time to wait until the sale is over and then decide to buy after you read a headline the best time to buy has passed
3895762 the conditions today are perfect for buyers we have a surplus of homes on the market there are many great mortgage products available to fi t the needs of every buyer and interest rates have never been better

3895800 no one should be surprised that the waterfront line is not carrying many passengers it doesnt go through any areas of very dense residential development it doesnt go through any areas of high density employment what rta has got to do is try to urge the city to build more housing close to the line develop more opportunities close to the line italics added
3895801 p ortland s integrated land use and transportation plans have greatly reduced the areas livability to halt urban sprawl and reduce peoples dependence on the automobile portlands plans use an urban growth boundary to greatly increase the areas population density spend most of the regions transportation funds on various rail transit projects and promote construction of scores of high density mixed use developments planners made housing unaffordable to force more people to live in multi family housing or in homes on tiny lots they allowed congestion to increase to near gridlock levels to force more people to ride the regions expensive rail transit lines they diverted millions of dollars of taxes from schools fire public health and other essential services to subsidize the construction of transit and high density housing projects those high costs have not produced the utopia planners promised far from curbing urban sprawl high housing prices led tens of thousands of families to move to vancouver washington and other cities outside the regions authority far from reducing driving rail transit has actually reduced the share of travel using transit from what it was in 1980 and developers have found that so called transit oriented developments only work when they include plenty of parking
3895802 in australia clubs are free to contact a player in the last year of his contract and announce a signing for the following year if they wish
3895803 we should follow suit because there is so much innuendo around now over here
3895804 english players are allowed to sign for australian sides so why not for super league clubs
3895805 gareth ellis is in the final year of his contract with leeds but we were free to tie up a deal with wests tigers in february and announce the move
3895806 gareth has continued to play to the best of his ability for leeds and the public are well aware how contracts operate
3895807 players have families and mortgages and it is only right and proper they should have opportunity to sort out their futures if they are coming out of contract without having to wait until sept 1

3895821 i dont pick players on reputation but on form i try to listen to plenty of opinions but realise i have to make the final decisions
3895822 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem its also important to recognize if you start drilling now you wont see a drop of oil for ten years which means its not going to have a significant impact on short term prices
3895823 at 20 08 million barrels of oil per day total demand was the lowest in 5 years
3895824 higher pump prices and a slowing economy were undoubtedly factors

3895830 not only in theory but in practice and on the ground
3895831 that means providing humanitarian aid and reconstruction to which we will be committed to then we want to try and have a political solution to the problem it will depend on how the events develop but we need to come up with a resolution for what was a frozen conflict because now it has turned into a real conflict

3895837 so the bottom line is theyre holding on for the long term and well see what happens
3895838 i dont know what happens in three years or what he says in five years or whatever but those discussions we dont get involved in
3895839 we are extremely pleased with these results recording the best quarter ever in our short history with successful outcomes achieved in all business segments
3895840 the fund believes its canadian operations will be strong for the rest of the year now that the wet weather appears concluded in western canada and the construction season is in full operation in the east
3895841 the united states currently has strong oil and gas activity levels in the west which help keep utilization levels strong along with several good projects in the east badger plans to continue to build new daylighting units at a rate of approximately six units per month
3895842 we have taken decisive actions to align our infrastructure and improve operating efficiencies across the company
3895843 although a more meaningful contribution will come once all initiatives are implemented
3895844 we continued to build our alternative asset management business in the quarter with our fundraising efforts for onex partners iii
3895845 two closings of third party capital for that fund totalling over us 2 4 billion were successfully completed and we believe that we are on track to conclude that fundraising in early 2009
3895846 they want to come in where theres an opportunity to invest some capital and take an ownership position but leave the operations in the hands of management
3895847 the economics on the expansions could look pretty attractive in terms of the payback and rate of returns
3895848 the problem is usually those big internationals want to operate as well in this case i would be very surprised if harvest gave up operatorship of the refinery
3895849 its actually cheaper to ship it than it is to pipeline it from the refining area down in the gulf of mexico
3895850 there actually is a geographic advantage to where theyre at right now
3895851 overall we performed well this quarter and this is once again proof that our strategy both geographically as well as between military and civil segments and products and services is paying off
3895852 we prepared over the last few years to better position our operations in these circumstances and some signs justify our optimism notably the military and civil sectors continue to be supported by long term economic conditions
3895853 while it may not show up in the amount of coal produced this quarter i am pleased with the improved productivity levels being achieved at the mines
3895854 we have increased productivity at the wolverine operation while brule continues to meet all expectations at its higher operating rates once past this phase of waste rock removal at wolverine well see coal production increase and we are confident that we will meet our production and cost goals for the year
3895855 as we achieve the full benefit of the current high coal price for all of our production expect an improvement in the ratio of clean coal produced to waste removed and lower our mining costs
3895856 if they opened it up a bit more i dont think it would hurt them and it would give them a lot better quality assurance
3895857 they just cant control everything and theyre losing valuable input that they could get from lots of people
3895858 its ok to have problems as long as you admit to them and fix them in fact if you admit to them and fix them it turns out to be an effect that creates more intense loyalty than you would expect
3895859 ive seen a number of issues with apple that would stop other vendors in their tracks and people are willing to give apple a break there
3895860 an intoxicating mix of brilliant industrial design transcendent software interfaces and consumable goods that are purely digital
3895861 apple could have stumbled meeting demand or failed on quality it did neither
3895862 when the itunes activation server went down on friday morning apple violated the cardinal rule first do no harm
3895863 fraught with problems including large initial downtime an extended e mail outage including lost messages the inability to contact the service to sync corruption of data time delays in syncing the computer to mobileme and more
3895864 apple has always made great products and they always expect to be phenomenally successful at launch but i think the appetite in the public for this kind of product is probably surprising
3895865 but this one may have some effects thanks to the outsized press coverage that apple launches typically command
3895866 i feel very sad because not that these people are going to lose their jobs but what theyre doing is so vital to the community
3895867 how is this occurring when we havent even passed this budget and were laying people off
3895868 but if we dont let them know that then they dont get the preferential treatment for any other positions that we have
3895869 its a difficult time there are some close colleagues and some very talented individuals being impacted
3895870 there is uncertainty but there is hope that the city of fort worth will find other positions for them within the city
3895871 all social engineering techniques are based on specific attributes of human decision making known as cognitive biases

3895874 its a different feeling this year as we are now the hunted but this is a new season and i want this team to feel like the hunters again
3895875 im very pleased with the results of the strength and conditioning testing
3895876 the guys who stayed around for the summer worked hard and it shows in the results
3895877 embraced it she used it as a tool to educate people
3895878 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3895879 it kind of brought her out of her shell she got to the point where she could joke about it
3895880 it is such a surreal feeling to look behind the bus and see semi trucks with my name on them
3895881 even as this thing grows our fans are the same young kids that have always come out to the club shows they come to forget about school or work or whatever and have a good time so thats what we are going to give them
3895882 the situation in georgia remains fluid and dangerous as soon as possible my colleagues senators lieberman and graham will be traveling to georgia theyre both members of the senate armed services committee i hope that other members of the armed services committee in the senate will go together
3895883 i dwell in the high and holy place and also with the one who has a contrite and humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite
3895884 how is it that you a jew ask a drink of me a woman of samaria
3895885 if you knew the gift of god and who it is that is saying to you give me a drink you would have asked him and he would have given you living water
3895886 sir you have no bucket and the well is deep where do you get that living water are you greater than our ancestor jacob who gave us the well and with his sons and his flocks drank from it
3895887 everyone who drinks of this water will be thirsty again but those who drink of the water that i will give them will never be thirsty the water that i will give will become in them a spring of water gushing up to eternal life
3895888 sir give me this water so that i may never be thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water
3895889 you are right in saying i have no husband for you have had five husbands and the one you have now is not your husband what you have said is true
3895890 sir i see that you are a prophet our ancestors worshiped on this mountain but you say that the place where people must worship is in jerusalem
3895891 woman believe me the hour is coming when you will worship the father neither on this mountain nor in jerusalem you worship what you do not know we worship what we know for salvation is from the jews but the hour is coming and is now here when the true worshipers will worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeks such as these to worship him god is spirit and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth
3895892 when he comes he will proclaim all things to us
3895893 i am he the one who is speaking to you
3895894 trif dollars are especially valuable to us in this time of tight budgets as they are allowing the ua to reach new heights in areas of special strength biosciences optical sciences and technology and water and environmental sustainability
3895895 trif investments have had huge financial leveraging power our trif supported faculty have brought in new federal and other grants that far outweigh the initial trif investments
3895896 at the time everyone was doing their own individual program here to welcome students but we wanted to consolidate our efforts

3895923 i challenge pulse asia on the fairness i request that experts now take a look at pulse asia over this particular survey loaded masyado and conducted just before the sona an ordinary citizen will immediately see that merong ibang agenda ito
3895924 i am not an expert so i am calling in experts the way it was done was not really to reflect public opinion but it had something else dont you think the dice is loaded it has to be looked into perhaps they were ok in their other earlier surveys but i question it the pre sona survey i challenge mores to look into it this specific survey
3895925 yes definitely we are questioning it because they are not independent they are not impartial they are biased
3895926 most surveys are biased depending on who commissions it in the pulse asia case former sen sergio osme a iii admitted paying for it so its no wonder the results were in favor of the opposition
3895927 everyone is entitled to his own opinion if apostol doubts our credibility then there are others who dont our procedures are scientific and we can prove we conducted interviews
3895928 if the results dont favor the one who commissioned the survey the results will not likely be made public
3895929 we have had our share of candidates who commissioned our survey but join in berating us if the survey is not in their favor

3895980 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
3895981 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable

3896008 i guess what fascinated me was her forgiving nature which i cover in my narration
3896009 she stated that although she did not speak the language of her captors the shawnee indians and french she was made to realize that her family was killed because they the shawnee were being pursued by settlers hoping to rescue them and their captors felt they could travel faster with fewer captives she also talks about how she understood the anger and hate that the indians felt for the settlers who were stealing the land and killing their people

3896013 i need to weep during each program which means i need to relive my own fathers death this is very powerful when performing for children because they become so engrossed in the program that they forget that it is a play and will even ask at the end how i mary jemison could possibly still be alive
3896014 i never planned on doing this as a career but i guess this is what i am meant to be doing
3896015 i came out from the pussy let me go back
3896016 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3896017 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3896018 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3896019 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3896020 final declaration of the yale common word conference july 2008
3896021 it seems that the implications of this verse were not realized or discussed
3896022 this is a step towards affirming that muhammad is a prophet and the quran a word of god
3896023 as christians we affirm that the promises of abraham are fulfilled in christ
3896024 no muslim or christian should tolerate the denigration or desecration of one anothers sacred symbols founding figures or places of worship
3896025 we raise these issues because of our concern for the biblical christian faith and for the implications of the common word process for christian minorities in muslim lands christian mission in muslim lands and converts from islam to christianity around the world
3896026 although we respect and love muslims christians cannot accept islam as an equal and valid revelation from god the denial of the deity of christ and his redemptive work as well as of the trinity will always stand in the way of interfaith dialogue and co operation
3896027 just as muslims cannot accept the christian denial of muhammads prophethood and the qurans status as the word of god so christians must take a clear stand on the central doctrines of their faith
3896028 fully affirm s and support s all endeavors to work for peace in this torn world
3896029 everyone has their own opinion of what i should do but i think that its my life
3896030 i know there might be wrong decisions that i make and there might be right decisions that i make but theyre decisions that i make for myself
3896031 and i think the only decision i can make is to be 100 per cent supportive of myself and not doubt myself at all
3896032 i think planning whats going to happen next year or this fall is going to happen after this week right now all im thinking about is how am i going to play good this week how am i maybe going to possibly win this
3896033 im not going to think about the future right now
3896034 i kind of feel sad for the guidance that she seems to not have in the right direction if she wants to be a golfer she should really concentrate on the being on the womens tour and dealing with them and learning to win
3896035 if i will come back in the future i guess time will tell
3896036 i never used the r word that gave me an opening but i dont have a timeframe i have a lot on my plate and im excited about the next chapter
3896037 the obvious thing that comes to mind was the hgh thing in the morning that was a really tough day for me
3896038 the other thing was the tough loss with the red sox celebrating on the field we had a 3 1 lead in the series going into the locker room and having grown men crying
3896039 im excited to be going to a team with a lot of pressure the alternative is going to a team where the games dont count im excited i love the pressure i want to pitch in a world series ive never pitched in a world series
3896040 i started praying i wanted to stay in the game
3896041 the siege and investiture of baron von frankensteins castle at weisseria
3896042 were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of this
3896043 i think were all hoping itll be shorter rather than longer but how he responds to it is going to be whats meaningful
3896044 they put a lot of sugar if you will into the coffee
3896045 stephen king doesnt take his coffee with sugar its no longer requisite to have a happy ending we wanted to stay faithful to the decisions in his original story
3896046 we are still scouting throughout the quad cities and the countryside beyond obviously since its children of the corn
3896047 my needs are quite simple i need corn and i understand you have that throughout the state
3896048 i have a lot of interest of people wanting to be in it
3896049 so when power went out i just assumed it was a simple case of oh well here we go again
3896050 that turned out obviously not to be true and we had a much more serious problem
3896051 i know i virtually lived at command headquarters for many days
3896052 and it was very rewarding to see how people pulled together i mean people didn t point fingers or blame they just got on with solving the problem
3896053 the blackout brought everything together around the kind of indecision that was beginning to form about the eves government
3896054 i think the decline and the image was already there and this was just another piece of evidence for the public at least they interpreted it that way that he was not a good public manager
3896055 well if i knew the answer to all those questions i might still be there
3896056 quite seriously it s hard to say i mean i don t think you can take one specific thing
3896057 i don t think that you can possibly rule out every eventuality but i think all of the objective analysis points to the province of ontario being involved in a pretty substantial renaissance of its electricity system
3896058 if you had a major transmission failure in the united states it would ricochet into ontario
3896059 as it is there isn t enough transmission right now to carry some of the proposed electricity to where it s needed so is it likely to be imminent no could it happen again sure could
3896060 not only is premier dalton mcguinty s government not prepared for the unexpected they re not even preparing for the expected which is a shortage of energy going forward
3896061 the fund believes its canadian operations will be strong for the rest of the year now that the wet weather appears concluded in western canada and the construction season is in full operation in the east
3896062 the united states currently has strong oil and gas activity levels in the west which help keep utilization levels strong along with several good projects in the east badger plans to continue to build new daylighting units at a rate of approximately six units per month
3896063 how many times have i told you not to call me at work
3896064 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die
3896065 the statistics we have released today underline that we are far from being in a position where we can feel comfortable although there are instances where improvements have been sustained the control of potential major incident risks seems to have taken a back seat
3896066 we continue to be concerned at the failure to reduce the number of hydrocarbon releases together with an increase in the number of major injuries this suggests that basic safety systems are not being followed
3896067 twenty years on from piper alpha we must learn key lessons to ensure that failures of basic systems do not lead to major incidents the secretary of state for work and pensions james purnell has asked us to conduct a thorough review of the industry following the kp3 report on asset integrity published last year this industry review will be a crucial part of our ongoing work in this high priority programme
3896068 with the demand for oil and gas so high and with assets being worked beyond their original intended life span it is more important than ever that the offshore industry continues to invest in the sector to protect its workers and puts safety first
3896069 despite the reduction in minor injuries the overall trend for these injuries does not yet show evidence of a significant decline and the potential for minor injuries to have been major injuries remains ever present the industry cannot afford to be complacent and faces a difficult task if it intends to achieve its current aim of being the safest offshore sector in the world by 2010 and will need to make significant improvements in hazardous incident performance to achieve this

3896154 the government says these poisons are increasing the risk of salmon extinction substantially we need to find alternatives and act quickly to prevent these chemicals from reaching west coast rivers and streams
3896155 we got into this mess because the bush administrations epa refuses to take seriously the harm that pesticides pose to salmon the biologists at the national fisheries management service have now confirmed that epa failed to acknowledge the true danger posed by these poisons earlier this week the bush administration announced a set of proposed rules that would cut these all federal wildlife experts out of similar future decisions they must think no one is noticing

3896178 im personally very happy and i hope ive made the chelsea fans happy ive had seven great seasons here and now i can have many more
3896179 its been a difficult summer for many reasons and that was one of the frustrating things a lot of things were said that were untrue some things were said that were slightly true and that was frustrating now we can put that to bed and concentrate on football
3896180 my world got turned upside down and i dont think it is anything anyone appreciates until you go through it
3896181 i feel for sure ive made 100 percent the right decision for myself for my family and for chelsea football club
3896182 this has always been a very important contract for me ive just turned 30 and i see it as my final big contract to see my playing days out at chelsea
3896183 i am delighted that frank has committed his future to the club
3896184 he is a key player for me and vital to chelseas future successes
3896185 frank is one of the best professionals i have worked with everyday he tries to learn something and bring new elements to his game
3896186 these are big issues for the club for frank and any other player
3896187 whatever has gone on i think there is that underlying desire that we get there
3896188 i think we should have scored in the first half
3896189 you dont get many chances and you have to take them we didnt do that we lost concentration on two occasions and got punished
3896190 thats what happens in europe against the top teams the inexperience in the dressing room showed and we have to learn from it but i cant fault the performance we had arsenal rattled especially in the first half
3896191 it was very difficult to play against that team they started very well and it was important for us to be strong
3896192 they were very passionate but in the second half we worked hard because we want to qualify for the champions league it is a big competition for us
3896193 central to this campaign because mccain needs it to be

3896197 i remember that we missed a ton of free throws 14 of their 34
3896198 and the pick and roll game we couldnt adjust to the pick and roll game by the time we adjusted the game was over
3896199 i was stunned if you can see the footage from that game i didnt want to get off the court after the game

3896249 i think weve frankly gone about as far as we can go
3896250 the question continues to be are there republican votes for it
3896251 weve said to the governor what do you need in order to move forward so weve negotiated on that point
3896252 ill guarantee you that there wont be anybody in the house thats going to be happy with the conclusion but it is a compromise new revenues and program cuts and no borrowing
3896253 weve always said that were not doing anything that gives away the legislative responsibility for appropriating money in the budget
3896254 when we go for a vote were going because its a budget that the governor can get some votes for
3896255 this is a proposal that im interested in looking at and we will see if this in fact is what is brought to the senate for consideration
3896256 i think the longs acquisition could negatively impact rite aid california stores
3896257 it could step up the competition in an important market for rite aid
3896258 california has always been a good state for rite aid
3896259 we have fully explored and exhausted every avenue for securing this funding in a manner that least affects californias budget and immediate cash needs
3896260 but the states leaders have failed to act therefore it is with great reluctance and yet a sense of firm conviction that today i seek the federal courts intervention to secure this funding
3896261 have repeatedly refused to provide timely construction funding to the receiver
3896262 stands in stark contrast to their recent public assertions of extraordinary powers to control state spending regarding state employee salaries and other obligations
3896263 will continue to work cooperatively with the receiver and the legislature to move forward in a fiscally responsible way to provide the necessary funding for the receivers efforts
3896264 i indicated to the legislature that i did not want to be drawn into the budget vortex where late night deals are made without public consideration and without time for thoughtful consideration
3896265 i dont want to be drawn into that theyve had plenty of time since the failure of the bond bill to act on this ive waited really as long as i can wait i do have a serious cash flow issue i need to get resolved

3896288 in pure raw numbers there are more loans because there are more people but on a ratio basis of how many people weve got and how many have loans its actually slightly declined
3896289 our concern is that the citizens that are paying taxes in the area have a voice and are listened to a little bit it doesnt seem that any of their concerns have been taken to heart
3896290 hopefully the citizens will choose to exercise their right to vote when it gets on the ballot id like to keep the 45 foot restriction like it was
3896291 i guess i should warn you if i turn out to be particularly clear youve probably misunderstood what i said
3896292 i do not understand why you continue to ignore the basic structure of how local government operates look at all of our surrounding cities do you see a city attorney constantly running to the paper to pass on questionable facts or promote his political agendas do you see council members like mccammack dominating council meetings to get tv time do you see council members constantly meddling in day to day operations no they recognize governmental structure follow it and are successful why isnt the sun chasing down stories in surrounding cities because there is no city attorney or loose lipped council person to provide your reporters with half truths the reason san bernardino cannot move forward is because each council member and the city attorney all act as if they are the chief decision maker and the sun continues to create hate and discontent by pandering to those so eager to whisper in your ear enjoy yourself as you tear the city apart and destroy lives for the sake of a headline
3896293 hurricane esther is now predicted to be building into a category 3 storm with winds becoming omnidirectional unpredictable and it appears they are going to continue to gain strength and receive more attention as time goes by it is apparent that the situation surrounding the operation phoenix centers will simply not die a natural hurricane type death until all information is forthcoming to the city manager oh where did he go now and the city council hurricane esther will continue to spin off water spouts that result in more questions being asked luckily the storm relief team of the sun is on the job and working day and night to ensure the flow of information is flowing to their readership i e the voters and maybe soon we will see the sun break through these storm clouds and into better times that are not as hot humid or as controversial
3896294 first off before i point any fingers i personally do want to apologize for the incident that happened at the ozone awards
3896295 i think that were just kind of steadily going on the bottom and eventually as credit loosens up we will see buyers
3896296 it is true and thus the question of whether it is sad or happy has no meaning whatever
3896297 they wonder what i have but that is only madness

3896306 he has not shown that the u s has either as a matter of deliberate policy or official indiffernce required or allowed its combatants to engage in widespread actions in violation of humanitarian law
3896307 no matter how much i wanted to i could not convince myself that killing someone was right
3896308 i have already missed a large chunk of my young sons life and i was willing to sacrifice any more lost time with him especially during his formative years
3896309 because it is an act of aggression with no defensive basis it has been supported by pretenses that cannot withstand even elementary scrutiny first before the u s dropped the first bomb it was quite evident that iraq had no weapons of mass destruction second the bush administration had the gall to exploit the american publics fear of terrorists by making the absurd assertion that a secular batthist government was working with a fundamentalist terrorist group there was nevery any intelligence to substantiate this third the notion that the u s wants to export democracy to iraq is laughable democracy is by the people not an appointed puppet theater
3896310 a u s soldier who deserted his iraq bound regiment and sought asylum in canada said the u s war in iraq was illegal and he accused the united states of committing war crimes pfc jeremy hinzman 25 is believed to be the first u s soldier to apply for refugee status in canada after refusing combat duty in iraq
3896311 i was told in basic training that if im given an illegal or immoral order it is my duty to disobey it
3896312 whether a country lives under freedom or tyranny or whatever else thats the collective responsibility of the people of that country
3896313 this is a very disappointing decision it puts canada more fully in complicity with an illegal and immoral war jeremy will probably end up back here at fort bragg thats usually what happens
3896314 i applied for conscientious objector status in the u s army because i realized that i cannot kill a fellow humna being but my application was denied i knew that in iraq i would be ordered to take part in combat operations or other actions that are against my principles
3896315 nga and i knew canada had welcomed many americans like us during the vietnam war and we knew canada had refused to join the invasion of iraq
3896316 sending jeremy and his family back to the u s where he would face harsh punishment would be cruel
3896317 it would fly in the face of the motion adopted by the house of commons on june 3 which called on the harper government to stop all deportation proceedings against these conscientious objectors
3896318 jeremy hinzman 29 had filed for a pre removal risk assessment and permanent residency on humanitarian and compassionate grounds with citizenship and immigration canada in january after several prior failed attempts to gain refugee status today he was told that both of those applications had been rejected and he must leave the country by sept 23
3896319 obviously were disappointed but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we end up
3896320 im disappointed but i think that every soldier that has refused to fight in iraq has done a good thing and im not ashamed
3896321 robidoux said hinzman who lives in toronto with his wife and two children plans to take a close look at the decisions before deciding how to proceed
3896322 federal ndp citizenship and immigration critic olivia chow who put foward the june 3rd parliament motion called the decision to expell jeremy mean spirited she called on citizenship and immigration minister diane finley to hald the deporation of hinzman and other resisters immediately
3896323 the war resisters support campaign is calling on supporters across canada to urgently continue to put pressure on the minority conservative government to immediately cease deportation proceedings against other us war resisters and to respect the will of canadians and their elected representatives by implementing the motion adopted by parliament on june 3rd
3896324 these refugees have an uncertain status they are referred to as guests not refugees and year long residency permits are hard to obtain the vast majority were granted short stays in the country which since 2005 have become virtually impossible to renew without official paperwork the refugees are not allowed to work
3896325 are being sold for sex there is a large sex trade in young iraqi girls in the nighclubs of damascus fourteen and fifteen year olds literally girls not even women yet and even children are being sold
3896326 they have been great to me but i will no longer be involved with the pageant due to the fact that i really couldnt take it when i saw all those refugees in syria being mistreated seing these people suffer made me ashamed i dont deserve to live in a classy apartment while other women are selling themselves what kind of sick demented human being would want to have sex with a 10 year old
3896327 annual government budget in iraq exceeds 70 billion us dollars where is that money going power cuts are long people get electricity for only an hour or two a day water is cut off as well
3896328 u s lawmakers appropriated 8 5 billion to train and equip iraqs security forces in 2007 and 2008 of that sum roughly 457 million went to the iraqi air force
3896329 t he bad news is that 12 000 people represent a tiny fraction of the vast exodus of iraqis driven from their homes by the violence and ethnic cleansing unleashed by the 2003 u s invasion estimates of their number vary the widely used figure of 5 million is about one in five to get that into context relative to the size of the population it would equal the forced displacement of almost 60 million americans
3896330 at the end of july european countries decided to halt the processing of accepting new refugees and to postpone until september discussions about those who submitted their requests for refugee status the decision does not stem only from concern over the growth in the number of iraqis in europe and an increase in the muslim element on the continent but primarily against the backdrop of iraqi preime minister nuri request to stop absorbing refugees al maliki explained to european heads of state and interior ministers he met with that the situation in iraq has improved and iraq needs its refugees in order to rebuild the state
3896331 the district commissioner of al multaqa district abdul kareem ali nasif and three of his guards were wounded by a suicide car bomb that targeted the convoy of nasif while he was going to his office district in al multaqa district west of kirkuk early morning

3896335 maria rosala mejia mqarroquin and anacleta tajtaj guatemalan immigrants were arrested in an immigration raid at the agriprocessors meatpacking plant in postville on may 12 the raid was the largest workplace raid in a single worksite in recent history both were released to care of their children but now have to wear ankle bracelets to monitor their movments they and 46 other women cannot work or travel and have been waiting for weeks for a hearing which would result in their deporation most have husbands or brothers now in federal prison forced to plead guilty to misusing a social security number as a result of the raid
3896336 we believe that these issues are typical of an immature chipset and radio protocol stack where we are almost certain that infineon is the 3g supplier
3896337 this is not surprising as the infineon 3g chipset solution has never really been tested in the hands of users some people will not experience these problems as it is only in areas where the radio signal weakens that the immaturity of the stack really shows
3896338 if it is an underlying problem with the processor that makes repairing it either difficult or impossible if that is the case that could be a disaster for apple
3896339 in any case the 3g performance is obviously a problem
3896340 can quite cheerfully sustain a couple of terahertz but your electronics cant do more than a few gigahertz
3896341 what we decided to do was to file a brief to lift the gag order on the mit students

3896350 we are deeply sorrowed by the death of the arkansas democratic party chair bill gwatney while we do not know the motive of the assailant we do know that a dedicated public servant lost his life today

3896362 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3896363 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3896400 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3896401 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3896402 its not like hes gonna be posing as i open the door
3896403 where does it go ive never been to a date before
3896404 you could say that i guess i got a full scholarship to texas a amp m
3896405 no i usually just shut your songs off the radio
3896406 ouch a little harsh so you probably know nothing about us
3896407 yeah itd be no fun if you already knew everything about me now this can be just like a regular date
3896408 its unthinkable to ask the government to force the church to abandon one of its sacraments to appease a radical anti religious agenda yet thats what this activist group did
3896409 all parents have the right to raise their children in their religious tradition which obviously includes participation in the historic rituals associated with that religion
3896410 this was a preposterous lawsuit and we are pleased that it has been dropped americans should be aware that such lawsuits may seem far fetched but they really are happening and foreign legal decisions are increasingly cited in american courts
3896411 does not allow as well that the parents may decide their children become members of a religious association
3896412 according to italian law the demand to remove a name from the register must be made by an individual with a personal interest rather than by a private association such as the uaar
3896413 also it was easy to demonstrate that the group had no legal leg on which to stand
3896414 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3896415 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3896416 pop secret popcorn is a strong business but general mills has chosen to prioritize other opportunities within our portfolio
3896417 probably what weve seen with a lot of these packaged food companies in last 10 years is a willingness to narrow down their portfolios and focus on things that are more core
3896418 if you are in a second or third tier position in a category you may not get as
3896419 one of the most satanic shows in the history of humanity
3896420 if they opened it up a bit more i dont think it would hurt them and it would give them a lot better quality assurance
3896421 they just cant control everything and theyre losing valuable input that they could get from lots of people
3896422 its ok to have problems as long as you admit to them and fix them in fact if you admit to them and fix them it turns out to be an effect that creates more intense loyalty than you would expect
3896423 ive seen a number of issues with apple that would stop other vendors in their tracks and people are willing to give apple a break there
3896424 an intoxicating mix of brilliant industrial design transcendent software interfaces and consumable goods that are purely digital
3896425 apple could have stumbled meeting demand or failed on quality it did neither
3896426 when the itunes activation server went down on friday morning apple violated the cardinal rule first do no harm
3896427 fraught with problems including large initial downtime an extended e mail outage including lost messages the inability to contact the service to sync corruption of data time delays in syncing the computer to mobileme and more
3896428 apple has always made great products and they always expect to be phenomenally successful at launch but i think the appetite in the public for this kind of product is probably surprising
3896429 but this one may have some effects thanks to the outsized press coverage that apple launches typically command
3896430 troy university has always been interested in providing opportunities for young people to better themselves and this is a situation where a young man who has made some mistakes is looking for a second chance
3896431 en italia el waterpolo es mi trabajo aqu ni te pagan
3896432 by the way im the father of john edwards baby
3896433 if this is the case apple could set up a trade in deal where people can
3896434 adobe wishes to encourage repeat sales from people who may have limited reasons for upgrading
3896435 i guess its worthwhile incentivising the purchase of new fridge as the technology is mature ipods etc are rapidly evolving so are self incentivising
3896436 is that they know their items will self destruct after a couple of years anyway
3896437 he vast majority have had issues with them crapping out within a couple of years generally out of warranty heh
3896438 we notified our commodity fund investors last week that the steep decline in natural gas and oil prices has had an adverse impact on our performance
3896439 when you have 85 billion barrels of oil to cover 87 billion the price has to go up
3896440 you dont know anything about car safety until you have lost a child in a car crash
3896441 you dont really know about workers unless you have been one yourself and been laid off
3896442 i think that as an economist you cant know what it feels like to be a vulnerable worker
3896443 bad laws are written bad rules of society are created basically bad decisions are made when peoples judgment is impaired
3896444 having said that you have tools such as the analysis of job satisfaction
3896445 i have doubts about the limits to growth and the lack of ability of economic models to factor in the not so material aspects of life
3896446 economists have admitted the limiting factors to growth since the profession started economics is the study of choice given scarcity after all
3896447 oil becomes scarce the price goes up alternatives are found and it is a relatively smooth process i gained the impression wrongly it seems that all economists believe in eg the infinite substitutability of resources
3896448 w e hear some talk about the cost of college and some discussion albeit not enough about issues that especially concern idealistic college students such as climate change but there is silence about the serious plight of working class youth
3896449 entrepreneurship education for students in title 1 high schools as policymakers grappling with the reauthorization of no child left behind are considering high schools part of a long term strategy to create greater economic opportunity in the us
3896450 you come to see old friends and meet new friends
3896451 tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3896452 bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
3896453 i do run two video cards on this board each with 256mb ram who would ever think that this would cause more system ram to be used strange
3896454 fue un montaje para dar cuenta de las m s de 11 500 mujeres que han accedido a una interrupci n legal del embarazo y de alguna manera esto permiti que no pongan en riesgo su vida por abortos mal practicados
3896455 nosotros confiamos plenamente en que la decisi n de la suprema corte de justicia ser a favor de las mujeres y de su salud sexual y reproductiva y estamos en d as para esperar una resoluci n
3896456 las razones son muchas y en este estilo art stico se observa la complejidad y diversidad por las cuales una mujer debe poder acceder a ese derecho
3896457 when you start flooding and youve got to walk out barefoot to get to your truck or you can barely make it up the street because its all muddy or full of water it makes it hard
3896458 theres been encroachment by folks who live on that lake below 468 so there may be some level of flooding to shorefront structures
3896459 theyve got to understand that this isnt just camps anymore people do live on the lake
3896460 limited interests and aspergers syndrome restricted areas of interest are a common symptom of pervasive developmental disorders in severe autism this may manifest as an overriding attachment to a specific object aspies tend to focus on an area of interest to the point of obsession a child with aspergers may develop an interest in buses for instance and memorize every bus number and route in town he or she may also be able to recite the makes and model yea of every bus in the fleet
3896461 no 7 sign on the sandwich board when really what they meant was

3896463 i feel powerless i feel like a subject awaiting what the good king will bestow upon us this time the result could be pleasing boring useful useless it doesnt matter really because it has nothing to do with me i am a minion
3896464 weve been trained to believe that gadgets come from big companies which is a fallacy
3896465 were not even in the same ballpark were filling that vast middle ground between iphone and electrical engineering
3896466 use with any audio source that uses a 1 8
3896467 that would be a good thing to write in your book but i was sleeping i dont remember anything and everyone who was there can testify to that
3896468 i want to do a long term program with that guy
3896469 we just wanted the food and nutrition people at the usoc to know that cornell had developed something very exciting
3896470 we explained that it was all natural organic and nutrient rich once the usoc folks tasted it they invited us to supply 6 000 tubes of applebooster to the team for their 12 hour flight to china we view it as our first true trial of applebooster and were excited to be part of the games
3896471 i turned my company over to my sons 20 months ago
3896472 but ive come out of retirement to work on this i think we can revolutionize the apple industry
3896473 natural functional foods like dapp are something positive that health professionals can stand behind
3896474 with americans getting only about half the daily requirements of fiber fruits and vegetables im optimistic that dapp fortified products can have a positive influence on the health of athletes of all ages
3896475 lirr solution me semble le plus commun et apparent vice de notre nature
3896476 kept noticing that a lot of 3d modellers would title their abstract models modern art
3896477 we believe that hes a danger to the community and that as a minimum he should have at least a 100 000 dollar cash bond or until after the prelim and the judge can set it then but have no bond at this point
3896478 vi r djupt sorgsna ver nyheten att bill gwatney har avlidit

3896480 california has sent a clear message today our state stands in solidarity with the winnemem wintu tribe to correct a terrible injustice by the federal government
3896481 its now time for the federal government to acknowledge its mistake and once again recognize the tribe
3896482 this resolution is long overdue for years we have struggled to maintain our traditions on our own
3896483 recognition would enable us to maintain our spiritual lifeways and get our youth scholarships and healthcare to have the state of california declare their support for us sends a message that we are no longer alone on this issue
3896484 we will be taking this resolution to washington d c we hope it will be impetus for our congressional representatives to help us
3896485 recognition impacts our very survival as a people california is in danger of loosing a part of its cultural heritage if we do not act on this now

3896568 im not sure im the right person to ask about essential things for the kitchen i can tell you what i have in my kitchen cupboards which has been enough to make a few chinese dishes basic ingredients include soy sauce i like kikkoman as its light sesame oil chilli sauce its too hot for me but my husband and visitors love it xo sauce an essential for me corn flour vegetable oil sichuan peppercorns sea salt and white peppercorns my mother always cooked with white pepper rather than black so we do the same dried noodles any kind that you like rice vermicelli and rice are other staples fresh ingredients can be bought when you know what youre going to cook ginger garlic spring onions coriander tofu fresh noodles any kind of chinese greens fish seafood etc in terms of equipment one needs very few specialist items we have one wok two bamboo steamers for dumplings and a metal rack to steam things on that goes inside the wok or large saucepan then we just use our normal kitchen pots and pans we make rice in a saucepan but if you wanted to you could buy a rice cooker if you were going to use it on a regular basis
3896569 i know it might sound daunting if you havent cooked much chinese food before but my husband and i have only made them three times in our entire lives in the last few months it becomes easier each time and now im really looking forward to making the next batch you can use any fillings that you like as there are no rules about what you can and cant use its fun to make dumplings with friends and family and you just learn and experiment as you go along the sealing and wrapping is the most creative and enjoyable part for me ive written about three ways to prepare chinese dumplings steaming pan frying and boiling them and id love to hear about your experiences

3896573 i dont think ive talked to enough lobbyists to make up my mind
3896574 i certainly believe that gerrie schipske is just as eager to achieve this for the people of our city they have the right to know which people are influencing the decisions that are being made whether by elected or staff officials
3896575 in the interest of fair play and transparency professional lobbyists working in long beach should have to inform the city reveal who employs them and periodically report their interactions with city officials to me its really a simple issue
3896576 all city officials need to do is open their calendars and put them on the internet
3896577 that would solve the problem beautifully without adding another layer of bureaucracy and forcing taxpayers to pick up the tab
3896578 ive never paid for any of your lunches and that is commendable

3896588 even though we are members of the labor party we believe the state government is heading against the party policy with reference to the possible privatisation of the power industry
3896589 as a group we have consistently opposed this privatisation through all channels including the local government annual conference

3896598 we are deeply sorrowed by the death of the arkansas democratic party chair bill gwatney while we do not know the motive of the assailant we do know that a dedicated public servant lost his life today
3896599 under the association of state democratic chairs the chairs vice chairs and executive directors of each state form a close bond we are a family
3896600 today we lost one of our members we send our condolences to bills family and to the people of arkansas which were long served by him
3896601 we are deeply saddened by the news that bill gwatney has passed away
3896602 his leadership and commitment to arkansas and this country have always inspired us and those who had the opportunity to know him
3896603 the only registrar position being advertised by the government is at bourke and the fine print at the bottom says that candidates may be eligible for consideration for other vacancies around the state
3896604 why did the minister tell our state member this story
3896605 once again it seems lithgow has been made the poor cousin to bathurst

3896609 john mccain also believes that tax cuts work best when tied to spending restraint
3896610 he has a 26 year pro life voting record and has pledged to appoint conservative judges who will interpret the law not legislate from the bench
3896611 reeds hypocrisy is legion now matched only by john mccains attending a fundraiser hes helping host
3896612 reed was involved in money laundering and mccains investigation uncovered it
3896613 this is a mistake by the mccain campaign i would be very surprised if he doesnt cancel this event
3896614 i find it laughable watchdog groups would go this route considering sen mccain chaired the senate indian affairs committee that investigated jack abramoff i suggest they take a closer look at barack obamas friends like convicted felon tony rezko or his national co chairman harry reid who took nearly 68 000 from abramoff
3896615 calling yourself a maverick and claiming credit for fighting corruption while raising money with one of the central figures in the jack abramoff corruption scandal is not what most voters have in mind when they think of straight talk
3896616 it is however one more example of why john mccain is offering more of the same failed republican leadership
3896617 i am just strongly supporting sen mccain im contributing to him and encouraging others to do so
3896618 how many people have been charged or indicted or accused of wrongdoing in that matter
3896619 i fully cooperated with the investigation and i was never accused of wrongdoing
3896620 i stated at the outset of the work that i would not be paid with any gambling revenues and none of the funds paid by me through the law firm or anyone else were from gambling
3896621 he is connected with christian conservatives and hes a pretty savvy political operator
3896622 this is the time when youve got to get all the forces in the party together
3896623 i do find it interesting that the two of them are now getting together the investigation was a cause celebre for mccain maybe that means mccain is forgiving his former enemies i should get in line

3896674 the writing of suarez through plunging me into evil became the cause of my seeking to purge what was evil in myself if i had no guilt to purge i would not have known where the road to hell was nor how to look for dora it was an 18 month journey during which the world of light was no stronger than my belief in it but it was enough for myself and dora to find our way back and out of the labyrinth on my journey i left the world for the page and the page of hell and the hope for the return journey i have returned i crept terrified into a dark place and struck a light in anothers darkness and i have returned here with the knowledge that doras agony among the lost is over the squalid atrocity of her death has dropped away from her and she is freed unlocked no longer lost and dead to herself which is what damnation is that i have never known dora in life that she was just the face in a police photograph of a dead anonymous girl whom i named dora doesnt matter that she should have found her identity is what matters what matters is that we met in the middle world where the living and the dead meet and brought each other away from that lightless place suarez was my atonement for 50 years indifference to the miserable state of this world it was a terrible journey through my own guilt and through the guilt of others
3896675 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3896676 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3896677 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3896678 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3896679 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3896680 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3896681 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3896682 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3896683 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3896684 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3896685 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3896686 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3896687 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3896688 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is
3896689 i said this the other day i dont think ive ever beaten chad
3896690 the manifestation of demons can be very frightening but you never have to be afraid of the devil because we always have the power of christ to deal with him
3896691 i find it very satisfying i wouldnt use the word pride because pride is something from the devil and the way you can actually do this is kind of work is to be very humble
3896692 and hes not actually bringing anything out and dusting it off its always been there maybe less practiced than it could be or should be but right now he sees that theres a greater need for it
3896693 in a better position than in all of history to discern and determine what is spiritual and whats not spiritual
3896694 the results showed that the preferences of women who began using the pill shifted towards men with genetically similar odours not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the pill as odour perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3896695 i sometimes think that being widowed is gods way of telling you to come off the pill
3896696 no woman can call herself free who does not own and control her body no woman can call herself free until she can choose consciously whether she will or will not be a mother
3896697 the pill to a great degree made possible the hetero sexual revolution yet those who developed oral contraceptives did not intend to promote what the majority of americans at the time called promiscuity
3896698 the freedom that women were supposed to have found in the sixties largely boiled down to easy contraception and abortion things to make life easier for men in fact

3896760 its a small tight knit community with really engaging friendly people who come together not only for academic purposes but to create a community a lot of people here come from new england and new york so you do get a sense of a comfortable homogenous population in that a very very comfortable experience that way if you like the cold and you want to be in the middle of nowhere its great too
3896761 community would be the best reason a lot of people think its a difficult school and it is particularly in the sciences but i think the community makes it worth it all the housing is on campus its a small town so all the students are pretty close there are a lot of great campus activities there are about 200 organizations so its really easy to get involved

3896763 the hands on academic experience and the professors who are willing to do anything for you its not uncommon here for students to have dinners at their professors homes its a really unique experience with professors in a very intimate setting its a really close knit community theres no hiding in a classroom youll have classes with seven or eight students being taught by someone with a doctorate you need to know the material beyond a superficial level
3896764 the best reason for a student to choose gustavus adolphus college is because of the small community feel students are able to get to know their professors and fellow students and students can find a fit for their personality types within the institution

3896807 the label of nihilistic writer so often attached to him is profoundly not just superficially accurate hes nihilistic not so much in the lay sense of having a gloomy outlook on life but rather inasmuch as his entire sensibility rests on an intimate relation with a space of annihilation of becoming nothing

3896834 the cases of deaths and new infections are almost half of what we have been registering in the past and the situation is getting much better because of increased awareness distribution of clean containers for water collection and storage and other supplies construction of more pit latrines among other interventions
3896835 this disease has nothing to do with any ones sexual life
3896836 having sex with an infected person does not lead to infection of the other person it is a misconception by many people out there
3896837 we are pleased that with the district wide mobilisation carried out to fight the disease a good number of homes now have latrines though a few others are still hesitant to have them we shall soon start working on them

3896883 non vi distinzione difatti tutti hanno peccato e sono privi della gloria di dio e sono giustificati gratuitamente per la sua grazia mediante la redenzione che in cristo ges il quale iddio ha prestabilito come propiziazione mediante la fede nel sangue desso
3896884 il sangue di ges suo figliuolo ci purifica da ogni peccato
3896885 chi ha il figliuolo ha la vita chi non ha il figliuolo di dio non ha la vita
3896886 a tutti quelli che lhanno ricevuto egli cristo ha dato il diritto di diventare figliuoli di dio a quelli cio che credono nel suo nome

3896901 se crediamo veramente che la messa salva le anime dal fuoco del purgatorio perch farsi pagare per farle uscire
3896902 egli la pietra che stata da voi edificatori sprezzata ed divenuta la pietra angolare e in nessun altro la salvezza poich non v sotto il cielo alcun altro nome che sia stato dato agli uomini per il quale noi abbiamo ad essere salvati

3896912 so what does giving away music do for promotional efforts according to ian rogers former yahoo music vp of product development and now ceo of topspin a new digital music marketing platform a good example is saul williams recent release
3896913 he sold about as many copies as he sold with his last release which was on a label
3896914 but because of the free downloads he was heard by ten times that and thats affected his ability to tour its affected his entire livelihood for him the pay what you want thing has absolutely been crucial to him or crucial for his career
3896915 i guess what fascinated me was her forgiving nature which i cover in my narration
3896916 she stated that although she did not speak the language of her captors the shawnee indians and french she was made to realize that her family was killed because they the shawnee were being pursued by settlers hoping to rescue them and their captors felt they could travel faster with fewer captives she also talks about how she understood the anger and hate that the indians felt for the settlers who were stealing the land and killing their people
3896917 as drug and alcohol abuse is a problem in our society today i felt marys story was a way to show the negative impact that it can have on families and entire societies
3896918 i also cover her acceptance and love of the indians and later the help afforded to her by escaped slaves when her village was destroyed by sullivans army and she was searching for a safe place for herself and at that time five children
3896919 when mary was interviewed by james seaver she wept when she talked of her family being killed
3896920 i need to weep during each program which means i need to relive my own fathers death this is very powerful when performing for children because they become so engrossed in the program that they forget that it is a play and will even ask at the end how i mary jemison could possibly still be alive
3896921 i never planned on doing this as a career but i guess this is what i am meant to be doing

3896931 nanny sighting logo about 11 45 a m on monday 8 11 08 gladwyne pa i saw an overweight caucasian female with blond hair and a bad frizzy perm pushing a dark bluish stroller down conshohocken state road towards the post office she was wearing an indescript dark green t shirt jeans and white sneakers this road is only one lane each way with no sidewalks she was pushing the baby going the same way as traffic cars and trucks its a major thoroughfare were whipping around them i was sick when i saw this it may as well have been a freeway it is an extremely dangerous road there have been many accidents and deaths on it and it is very twisty as well the baby had light brownish blondish hair and looked not more than about a year old she had on a pink foral shirt denim clamdigger looking shorts and soft leather pink shoes they went into the post office where the woman spent quite alot of time baby was very antsy and unhappy the woman thrust a piece of paper at the baby in a very exasperated way to try to distract her not even a toy but a post office pamphlet or something to that effect as a mother i would never expect for someone to put my child in such a dangerous situation as this i am assuming this was a nanny as this particular location is extremely wealthy and she did not have the appearance of a resident
3896932 this post bothered me not because of the person pushing the stroller but the description of this individual and to automatically asssume it was a nanny because of her appearance that seems a little stuck up to me maybe shes a struggling mother who doesnt have a car at her disposal and she cant help it if theres no sidewalk maybe instead of writing on here you can call the town up and mention that you see people walking on the side of this dangerous road and suggest they put in a sidewalk thanks
3896933 appearance of resident stuck up sexually frustrated miserable human being and fyi darling while gladwyne is certainly no ghetto it is not nearly as nice or wealthy as you think it is
3896934 when we see people puttiing children in harms way or neglecting them we usually see them in the ugliest of lights thats the truth deal with it

3896938 clinton dwells on faith as a central part of her life
3896939 its a bit patronising for us 21 year olds to try to start to change the world
3896940 especially when were using enough power for 10 houses just for stage lighting itd be a bit hypocritical
3896941 the last thing the planet needs is a rock concert
3896942 a leading muslim cleric has blamed the devastating drought climate change and pollution on australians lack of faith in allah
3896943 climate change is possibly the biggest threat to life on our planet indeed it should be of special concern to muslims since most of the effects will be felt in muslim world
3896944 climate change is overwhelming the situation in africa unless we take genuine steps now to reduce our emissions people in the developed world will be condemning millions to hunger starvation and death
3896945 how to design a new model for human progress and development that is climate proof and gives everyone a fair share of the natural resources on which we all depend
3896946 developing countries like most of our muslim countries particularly the least developed are generally poorest in this regard as a result they have lesser capacity to adapt and are more vulnerable to climate change damages
3896947 in the face of this i look forward to how the government is going to brace people to having to double their life insurance payments in order to save the planet
3896948 michael glatze had become a frequent media source as founding editor of young gay america magazine snip has received numerous awards and recognition including the national role model award from the major homosexual rights organization

3896953 libby was sentenced under the same laws as other criminals
3896954 accountability has been in short supply in the bush administration and this commutation fits that pattern
3896955 only a president clinically incapable of understanding that mistakes have consequences could take the action he did today
3896956 using that power to benefit his own vice presidents chief of staff who was convicted of such a serious violation of law
3896957 by his action today the president shows his word is not to be believed
3896958 i call for all americans to flood the white house with phone calls tomorrow expressing their outrage over this blatant disregard for the rule of law
3896959 makes a mockery of the justice system and betrays the idea that all americans are expected to be held accountable for their actions
3896960 the president continues to abdicate responsibility for the actions of his administration
3896961 the arrogance of this administrations disdain for the law and its belief it operates with impunity are breathtaking
3896962 because of the intense scrutiny and criticism of the pardons of marc rich and his partner pincus green and because legitimate concerns have been raised i want to explain what i did and why
3896963 a president may conclude a pardon or commutation is warranted for several reasons the desire to restore full citizenship rights including voting to people who have served their sentences and lived within the law since a belief that a sentence was excessive or unjust personal circumstances that warrant compassion or other unique circumstances

3896966 this case has generated significant commentary and debate critics of the investigation have argued that a special counsel should not have been appointed nor should the investigation have been pursued after the justice department learned who leaked ms plames name to columnist robert novak furthermore the critics point out that neither mr libby nor anyone else has been charged with violating the intelligence identities protection act or the espionage act which were the original subjects of the investigation finally critics say the punishment does not fit the crime mr libby was a first time offender with years of exceptional public service and was handed a harsh sentence based in part on allegations never presented to the jury
3896967 we dont really have the ability to enforce the law with respect to illegal work in this country in a way thats truly effective
3896968 i think were going to say to the members of congress who think they have a better way that they should produce legislation and pass legislation which they have not done for the past two years
3896969 it is very important now that all parties cease fire
3896970 the russians need to stop their military operations as they have apparently said that they will but those really do now need to stop
3896971 thats whats at stake when russia engages in behavior that looks like its from another time
3896972 they need to think about whether they havent achieved some tactical objectives at the expense of some strategic objectives
3896973 unless theres a precipitous drop in gas prices which i dont see happening when people get back from summer vacation there may be more need to add more services throughout the syracuse and onondaga county area

3896976 a very simple matter got very very complicated today and it wasnt me that was complicating it and i dont really care to have things misrepresented to the council body that i know to be untrue
3896977 absolutely theyre not telling the story at the table theyre working to get this thing scuttled for whatever reason i dont know
3896978 we all show some frustration on council from time to time including myself
3896979 but to attack a director like he did to make false accusations and false statements is something this council body is not going to stand for

3896983 we should also keep in mind that with 24 of europeans driving time spent in traffic jams the costs caused by congestion could reach 80 billion by 2010 so clearly saving time through smart vehicles communications systems means saving money
3896984 i know you guys would like to make it a problem but whether they are or they arent it aint a problem cause we aint gonna let it be a problem aight
3896985 just be careful about those credit cards all right dont eat out as much
3896986 the democratization of credit has really generated a competitive spending culture and plastic has allowed for material goods not had in the previous generation
3896987 most of us grew up in a home with just one or two bathrooms for the whole family he points out today new homes usually have at least one bathroom per bedroom
3896988 this generation feels that somehow or another theyre going to figure out some technological advancement thats going to get them out of their financial troubles and outsmart the market
3896989 im fed up with credit card company tricks that drive us deeper in debt
3896990 as the american blessing of credit cards became widespread so did the american curse of debt

3896993 why have the scorpions not investigated chemical warfare expert wouter basson and the cia who have created this aids the scorpions are working for mi5 and the cia and not for south africa
3896994 integration would streamline and strengthen capacity in the fight against crime
3896995 disbanding it requires a political decision the scorpions chose some prime cases because they were serving the interests of their own political masters
3896996 where they have not succeeded they have been mum to the media

3897000 basically thats just how long it takes the signal to get from one point to another and like i said the phones are always polling for towers
3897001 and if the call was handed off then the billing records may show that it went from tower a to tower b and then tower c and then you could really firm up what direction somebody was going and what time of day it was

3897013 whether it is a commuter who wants their journey to be fast and hassle free a college student looking to get across campus or an active senior looking to combine exercise with convenience this is the ideal transportation method
3897014 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3897015 in a way russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3897016 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3897017 means that georgias ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defense department
3897018 we have no need nor do we intend to take over any georgian air or seaport to deliver humanitarian aid
3897019 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea

3897030 ive branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry
3897031 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
3897032 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
3897033 co operation ireland has been very successful in a conflict situation for the last 30 years but the context has changed out there and the challenge will be to be as equally successful in the next 30 years of co operation ireland in a different context
3897034 youre in a peace building context people have this view that the peace is done and its all over and to some extent that part of the conflict is over but its by no means stable yet yes a lot of the engagement has been at the top political level but actually the grassroots hasnt been engaged in it
3897035 all of that political agreement needs stabilised and needs underpinned at the grassroots level which is what peacebuildings about in some ways the peace making is a pragmatic enterprise whereas peace building is much more vision oriented its not about single events its about process and a process that will take years and so the context becomes more difficult
3897036 international land border here which no other police force in the uk has
3897037 no one has gone public to say the army council has gone away
3897038 what i can say with absolute certainty is that in terms of pira activity that is to say terrorist activity its not happening
3897039 does it mean all the provos have gone into nine to five jobs of course it doesnt there are some involved in organised crime without a doubt but operating as individuals not operating as an organisation and i think thats the key distinguishing factor
3897040 on the other side of course it must be hugely frustrating to those who dont have that confidence
3897041 so i can understand i think the unionist community are going to look for a lot more than just a statement that pira have gone away before they are satisfied but we are not seeing activity
3897042 it pira has reduced in size but it is there
3897043 the organisation is dedicated to following a political path but it will not disband to the point where it could not carry out an operation if it needed to
3897044 anyone who can help us prevent this type of activity should come forward to the police
3897045 those responsible for planting these devices show a callous disregard for human life
3897046 those responsible seem intent on following their own selfish agenda and the only way for communities to be free from such activity is to help officers bring these criminals before the courts
3897047 there was no claim of responsibility but dissident republicans were suspected of being responsible the devices were being examined
3897048 formal consultation on equality impact assessment eqia of northside urban village draft regeneration framework
3897049 the dup was relentlessly trying to interfere in the uup tory talks and would not be ditching its support and links with the order
3897050 party policy for the rest of the uk has to reflect different situations in other regions unlike northern ireland most parts of gb do not have a selection based post primary system therefore party policy has to reflect different local circumstances
3897051 enceladus has got warmth water and organic chemicals some of the essential building blocks needed for life
3897052 we have quite a recipe for life on our hands but we have yet to find the final ingredient liquid water but enceladus is only whetting our appetites for more
3897053 unfortunately from a republican perspective there are two different jurisdictions and two different economies and two different realities on the island
3897054 the major question historians will ask is not why the republicans surrendered but why they fought such a futile long war
3897055 it has not been unconditional surrender and it has been infinitely better than continuing to fight a futile war for the sake of honouring irelands dead yet producing only more of them but let us not labour under any illusions that the conditions were good

3897064 tibolone which is used around the world for menopausal symptoms decreases the risk of fractures decreases the risk of breast cancer but increases the risk of stroke in this group of women who are all over the age of 60
3897065 for older women you should stop taking tibolone or not consider starting it
3897066 theres probably nothing more fundamental to civil rights than the ability to name oneself you wouldnt call someone a negro today and we use asian instead of oriental retard is a slur that opens up wounds
3897067 even if the movie is spectacular it imbeds that speech in society you cant legislate against it but you can advocate about the damage that gets done
3897068 because what this whole shameful episode makes clear is that this entire promotional campaign the posters the web sites the trailers everything made it through the entire dreamworks production and promotion process without anyone not one person ever stopping to ask themselves sure we can say anything we want sure we can use the word retard but do we want to should we is it right is it kind who would we hurt nobody asked nobody asked
3897069 craig ludin is 32 hes best at swimming although he plays a good golf game too he works at capital one bank he has down syndrome and he hates the word retarded i feel unhappy and hurt when they use the word retarded said ludin of dix hills its very hurtful ludin who added that he is a capable adult who graduated from high school said there is no place in society for the word

3897087 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
3897088 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
3897089 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
3897090 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
3897091 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
3897092 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3897097 provides advertising based on consumers activities online we strive to do this in a way that provides value to our users and protects their privacy
3897098 new technologies such as deep packet inspection technologies have the ability to track every single website that a consumer visits while surfing the web
3897099 this sweeping ability to collect analyze and profile how individuals use their broadband connection raises clear privacy issues and i believe such activity should occur only with the express prior consent of individual citizens
3897100 what types of data are being collected who has access to that data how long is it stored what access does the consumer have to this data
3897101 some users like myself might welcome ads narrowly targeted to their interests the problem comes when companies dont let the consumer drive the process anytime a consumers information is being collected the consumer should have the ability to proactively decide whether or not to allow that process to take place
3897102 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

3897107 la empresa manquiri s a al estar operando en territorio boliviano debe sujetarse a lo dispuesto por el ordenamiento jur dico nacional en materia de derechos de pueblos ind genas como son el convenio no 169 ratificado por ley no 1257 y actualmente la declaraci n de las naciones unidas ratificada por ley no 3760 esto implica que si la demanda del ayllu resulta evidente y fehaciente la empresa tendr que realizar sus descargos respectivos ante las instancias respectivas
3897108 las personas privadas extranjeras que operan en el pa s como es la empresa manquiri subsidiaria de la minera americana coeur dalene como en el presente caso y que tienen adem s instancias encargadas de velar que el desempe o de sus inversiones es la tarea de opic no derive en da os a las comunidades ind genas y originaria son bien acogidas sus iniciativas de soluci n de conflictos que permitan alcanzar una real y efectiva restituci n de los derechos vulnerados o en riesgo de ser vulnerados
3897109 las pol ticas del opic obligan a la empresa a financiar un plan de desarrollo para pueblos ind genas y manquiri no lo financi el proyecto minero caus el reasentamiento de algunas familias del ayllu que fueron removidas sin un plan de reasentamiento lo que implica que no hubo una metodolog a para compensar estas familias adem s causo la fractura de la comunidad porque la empresa no ofreci tierras como parte de la compensaci n sino ofreci casas en la ciudad lejos de su comunidad del pastoreo y de sus animales
3897110 en el marco de sus atribuciones y competencias conferidas por la constituci n pol tica del estado y la ley no 1818 en lo que toca a preservar el respeto a los derechos humanos de los pueblos ind genas reflejados en el ordenamiento jur dico nacional y los instrumentos internacionales reconocidos por bolivia
3897111 la empresa va a tratar de resolver este conflicto muy r pidamente para no da ar m s su reputaci n los miembros del ayllu no deber an someterse a una negociaci n que no tiene condiciones justas y deber an exigir que opic tome la responsabilidad por los incumplimientos de sus pol ticas por parte de la empresa minera en cuesti n

3897115 entre 2006 y 2008 registramos diez allanamientos del tipo que vivimos durante la dictadura 1973 1990 con helic pteros con fuerzas combinadas con violencia al interior de las casas golpeando a la gente rompiendo enseres dom sticos puertas

3897121 en nuestro pa s han sido declarados enemigos los j venes que expresan su descontento por la ausencia de perspectivas de futuro los estudiantes que se oponen a la mercantilizaci n de la educaci n los trabajadores sindicalizados que luchan por condiciones laborales dignas y los mapuches que exigen la restituci n de sus tierras ancestrales
3897122 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
3897123 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
3897124 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
3897125 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
3897126 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
3897127 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
3897128 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

3897146 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores

3897162 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3897163 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3897164 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3897165 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3897166 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
3897167 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
3897168 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3897169 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3897170 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3897171 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3897172 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3897173 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3897174 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3897175 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3897176 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3897177 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3897178 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3897179 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
3897180 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3897181 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3897182 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3897183 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3897184 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3897185 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3897186 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3897187 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3897188 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3897189 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3897190 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3897191 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3897192 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3897193 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3897194 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
3897195 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
3897196 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
3897197 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
3897198 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
3897199 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3897200 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3897201 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3897202 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3897203 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3897204 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3897205 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3897206 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3897207 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3897208 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3897209 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3897210 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3897211 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
3897212 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3897213 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3897214 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3897215 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3897216 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3897217 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3897218 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
3897219 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
3897220 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
3897221 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3897230 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3897231 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3897232 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

3897283 this ex marine redeems himself with the gutsiest grittiest collection released by a nashville major label in recent memory
3897284 the deep voiced johnson has that sad eyed straight talking storytelling quality that turned waylon jennings and george jones into superstars

3897289 we were appealing to everybody in the international community including russia saying stop that unfortunately no help came
3897290 the sight of russian tanks in gorki russian tanks in senaki the russian blockade of poti the georgian port are a chilling reminder of times that i think we had hoped had gone by

3897293 in the past we used to think if a woman is having sexual problems shes frigid and she needs to go home and have a glass of wine and relax
3897294 however there is emerging data associating underlying medical causes with female sexual dysfunction

3897298 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3897299 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3897300 i think the events of the last few days show that there are many places in the world where we dont necessarily anticipate this kind of conflict breaking out
3897301 it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
3897302 obviously were not going to know today or tomorrow the length of the thing well let him get treatment hopefully its quicker than not
3897303 i think there was so much pressure on lebron to create so much of the offense in cleveland
3897304 i think somebody like mo is going to really make the game easier for lebron and create opportunities for other people
3897305 hes been to oklahoma city hes familiar with the people there hes familiar with the ford center hes played there the fans loved him when he was there his nickname is the cowboy its really apropos to come back
3897306 he has been managing the game very well he has been making good decisions on where to throw the ball he makes some really great throws every now and then he will fumble a snap go the wrong way those are the type of things that just kill a play i see him improving on those i see him getting better
3897307 being sharp out there focusing on signals focusing on the playbook trying to be a quarterback more than just an athlete out there
3897308 when i run the ball i feel like i will take it to the house every time
3897309 if i cut back okay im taking it i try not to settle for less i try to make that my backup option to throwing the ball you want to be explosive with arms and legs you look at vince young steve mcnair mcnabb even tim tebow pat white
3897310 jordan is the type of guy who doesnt make many mistakes a good manager likes to dink and dunk
3897311 chris might have a little more freedom laid back me i try to make plays every time i get the ball thats what i am used to when i was at florida trying to make big play every play here is more of managing the game i think i bring big play potential to the offense
3897312 thats what he has to do stay on sometimes he is just not there he is somewhere else its time to play someone else when that happens and that may happen this year we could be playing him and its not his day and we need to make a move and play someone else and he doesnt need to get upset about it
3897313 they were tired and they were sore but this was a character practice
3897314 i need to get in there and motivate them i need to get more actively involved thats probably the best way i coach anyway they can count on that the rest of the year anyway
3897315 yang jelas tahun ini pemenangnya dki jakarta sebelumnya dua tahun berturut turut jawa tengah ini artinya ada pergeseran dan dki barangkali sudah mempersiapkan tim osnnya jauh jauh hari dengan pembinaan dengan pelatihan untuk menjadi juara umum prediksi saya malah tadinya jawa timur
3897316 wilayah timur juga sudah mulai muncul satu persatu seperti ntt dapat 2 emas bali juga ini artinya sudah mulai ada pemeretaan osn kan juga merupakan salah satu indikator untuk melihat bahwa kualitas pendidikan sudah mulai merata
3897317 kita tahu sekolah sekolah di wilayah timur kan kekurangan fasilitas seperti laboratorium perpustakaan juga kualitas gurunya masih kurang serta manajemen sekolah tetapi dengan adanya osn ini saya kira sudah mulai ada peningkatan
3897318 dalam rangka peningkatan mutu itu semua harus diprogramkan yang lebih penting dengan melakukan itu akan ada daya saing dan kita harapkan hal itu bisa jadi budaya
3897319 two guys have really impressed me in camp so far
3897320 there was significant and rapid improvement in seattle angina questionnaire scores among patients in the medical therapy group
3897321 on the basis of these data 17 patients would need to be treated with percutaneous coronary intervention versus optimal medical therapy as compared with optimal medical therapy alone for one to have a significantly greater angina relief 11 would need to be treated for one to have a significant benefit in physical function and 12 5 would need to be treated for one to have a significant improvement in quality of life
3897322 we now can offer patients the option of optimal medical therapy with the assurance that over time the outcome will be the same as stenting
3897323 this in no way diminishes the role of stenting in treating unstable angina or mi
3897324 the contemporary roles of optimal medical therapy and percutaneous coronary intervention in the management of patients with stable angina
3897325 rather than one victor courage demonstrates that both treatment strategies can have a profoundly positive effect on patients health status and suggests complementary roles optimal medical therapy as first line therapy with pci reserved for patients who do not have a response or who have severe baseline symptoms
3897326 effect of pci on quality of life in patients with stable coronary artery disease
3897327 we are just opening things up just like we did with the new multiple auctions competition creates a better product and what may be good for one company can not stand in the way of what is good for the entire industry there was a lot of pressure not to do that as you might imagine but we have to do what is best for domainers not what is best for individual companies and sponsors the results as always will be quite evident and visible for the entire industry to see once we get to new york no question that domainers welcome this decision and it will change the game as we know it plus its gonna be a lot of fun the idea for opening up the sponsorships actually came from dan warner in a conversation a week or so ago he suggested that we auction off the auction slots to the highest bidder in future shows i just took his suggestion and applied it in a slightly different direction bidding for sponsorships that just started yesterday is already very active and new faces companies and solutions are coming into the industry because of it that is not in the best interest of the status quo there are those that have taken our business and traffic for granted and the competition we are going to introduce in new york will challenge the business as usual mentality should sponsors take notice you betcha

3897332 isp is truly excited to establish this new relationship with the university of arkansas one of the great athletic programs in the country
3897333 we also are excited about being able to work with katv and building on the 40 year tradition katv has established in bringing the passion of razorback athletics to the state of arkansas
3897334 we are pleased that through our new agreement with isp katv will remain at the forefront of razorback coverage for many years to come
3897335 we have enjoyed our four decade partnership with the university of arkansas and are looking forward to maintaining that relationship moving forward via our partnership with isp as the continuing home of the razorbacks
3897336 from the beginning of our discussions with katv and isp i was excited about what the partnership would mean for razorback athletics
3897337 i have worked with a number of other multi media rightsholders but in my opinion isp is the best and is clearly the leader in college sports
3897338 our agreement with isp not only helps protect us from uncertain financial times but also guarantees revenue at a significantly higher level than what we have generated in the past
3897339 as our budget continues to reflect the increasing costs associated with operating a 19 sport program the increased revenue generated from this partnership will help us secure the essential funding to support our more than 450 student athletes and provide them the resources to succeed in the southeastern conference and nationally

3897346 quando la carta mi tagli il dito lo alzai per esaminare il danno dalla ferita invisibile colava una minuscola goccia di sangue poi accadde tutto molto velocemente edward si lanci verso di me scagliandomi dallaltra parte del tavolo ero caduta vicino al pianoforte gettando le braccia in avanti per proteggermi in mezzo alle schegge di vetro affilate dal polso al gomito ormai il dolore minvadeva acuto e bruciante confusa e disorientata cercai di non badare al rosso vivo del sangue che mi colava dal braccio e incrociai gli sguardi eccitati di sei vampiri improvvisamente famelici
3897347 nel silenzio assoluto unintuizione improvvisa rimise ogni dettaglio al suo posto cera qualcosa di cui edward non aveva voluto parlarmi qualcosa che jacob non mi avrebbe tenuta nascosta qualcosa che aveva attirato i cullen e i lupi nella foresta e li aveva fatti avvicinare pericolosamente tuttavia stavo aspettando proprio quel momento lo temevo ed ero pronta ad affrontarlo malgrado desiderassi con tutta me stessa che non arrivasse mai ma i miei guai non potevano aver fine vero

3897499 his methods are far from polished when he prayed for people in lakeland he usually began by laying his hand on their heads and then yelling bam often the people fell backward to the floor after one elderly woman fell bentley told the audience she doesnt know why she fell down the woman then laughed and said to him in the microphone because you pushed me he prayed for her three more times that night and she said she could hear better during the past three weeks people have testified of being healed from heart conditions skin rashes and back problems and many said scars disappeared many charismatics are wondering if the protracted meetings will become a phenomenon similar to what happened in rodney meetings in lakeland in 1993 at the toronto airport vineyard church in canada in 1994 and at brownsville assembly of god in pensacola in 1995

3897554 do not lose heart though outwardly we are wasting away yet inwardly we are being renewed day by day for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all so we fix our eyes not on what is seen but on what is unseen for what is seen is temporary but what is unseen is eternal

3897586 commissioner goodell told jones that his continued participation in the nfl depends on demonstrating that he can conduct himself in a lawful and reliable manner
3897587 jones will be expected to continue the personal conduct program established by the nfl and the cowboys and to avoid further adverse involvement with law enforcement

3897598 did you hear of the phillies putting in a claim for raul ibanez
3897599 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3897600 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3897601 this is obviously an outrage a terribly brutal act which i think should remind everybody of the brutality of the taliban and the danger that everybody there faces
3897602 at this point any conflict i might have is more than eased by the knowledge that barack obama if elected could be the salvation of a country in free flight failure
3897603 i m not arguing that it s wrong to vote for obama though i do say it s wrong headed to vote for him with any lofty expectations
3897604 they re voting for the end of affirmative action and they don t even know it
3897605 they re voting for the end of race and they don t even know it
3897606 from that to seeing barack obama and the enthusiasm he s generated it s almost full circle to me that america could grow to the point where it could see someone like barack obama in a different light
3897607 you remarked that reverend jeremiah wright expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country
3897608 we believe that wright is exactly right that racism is not only endemic but is at the core of american society as reflected in a large and well established body of social scientific research
3897609 it was the best speech on race ever given by a major presidential candidate
3897610 i think it really is going to change the way responsible people talk about racism
3897611 their basic idea that racism is at the heart of how americans feel simply has been shown not to be true in the way that they said it
3897612 are they still going to whine endlessly about racism in america
3897613 immigration to the united states and world wide greenhouse gas emissions
3897614 a media research center study of abc cbs and nbc news broadcasts from the formal announcement of the obama campaign on february 10 2007 through july 15 reveals that a viewer watching only broadcast tv news would have received a much more limited and even censored version of wright s sermons

3897621 who s paying reflects both the capacity to pay and the interest in stopping illegal immigration
3897622 i would have thought that people would have been more sensitive and sympathetic to the concern to the members of our community who want to celebrate their religious faith
3897623 it s a little disingenuous to say that they tyson were responding to employee concerns the proposal came from workers themselves
3897624 let us start using this term such concept of latin america was imposed on us
3897625 we are including the black american and the white european because we do not exclude anyone for that reason everyday i speak less and less of hispanic america or latin america we are from indo america from afro america that is what we are instead of any other name
3897626 make proposals requests or petitions to the authorities of their countries that way
3897627 we will commit to the needs of our indigenous peoples
3897628 evo must be declared the president of all the indigenous peoples of this continent he must be the leader of indo america

3897645 you know what thats not how georgia changes its leadership and thats not how the world should work
3897646 we choose our leaders thank you very much mr putin
3897647 were not saying saakashvili is perfect were saying hes the leader of georgia and he should stay the leader of georgia
3897648 we know there are tanks coming here we know theres still fighting going on

3897652 i hasten to express to you once more my deep gratitude for the affectionate reception which i received from you and all your fellow citizens
3897653 i was honoured by the official welcoming ceremony at government house and most appreciative of the personal welcome which you extended to me at your sydney residence admiralty house pope benedict said
3897654 please also accept my heartfelt thanks for the many courtesies afforded me throughout my visit
3897655 i am grateful to the various civil and military authorities of australia as well as the residents and business people of sydney whose spirit of collaboration helped to ensure the warm welcome of the pilgrims and the smooth progress of my visit he said
3897656 may the lord bless all of you abundantly for your kindness and hospitality
3897657 the agreement was if they came here for wyd there would be special provisions for them that if they stayed beyond world youth day the normal laws of the land would apply
3897658 obviously were aware that there are pilgrims out there who have been given three month visas and so it might well be at the end of those three months we see a spike in applications for protection

3897664 at the outbreak of violence russia had tried to have the united nations security council issue a statement calling on georgia and south ossetia to immediately lay down weapons however washington was disinterested

3897666 this is not about georgia any more it is about america its values
3897667 urgent event russian georgian war a challenge for the u s and the world
3897668 seem happy to work together to weaken the influence of the united states and its democratic allies
3897669 significant long term impact on relations between washington and moscow
3897670 so why dont you shut up oh and by the way send some more of your military advisors to georgia they are doing a sterling job and they look all funny down the night sight all green
3897671 it is regrettable that on the day before the opening of the olympic games the georgian authorities have undertaken aggressive actions in south ossetia
3897672 the crews are assigned the task to not allow arms and military hardware supplies to reach georgia by sea
3897673 they are state criminals who must be tried for the crimes committed in south ossetia the genocide of the ossetian people
3897674 its really really quiet eerily quiet everyone was either at home or had packed up and moved out of the city people are really really scared people are panicking
3897675 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
3897676 israel should be proud of its military which trained georgian soldiers
3897677 the russians have lost more than 50 tanks and we have shot down 11 of their planes they have enormous damage in terms of manpower
3897678 the georgian forces are not retreating we move our military according to security needs
3897679 the russians dont look kindly on the military cooperation of israeli firms with the georgian army and as far as i know israelis doing security consulting left georgia in the past few days because of the events there
3897680 she was saying that somebody was in her office shooting a gun and she didnt know if he had been hit

3897682 he kept saying he needed to see the chairman and then just went around her and started shooting
3897683 she said he didnt scare me he was puzzling to me for some reason and i was trying to get rid of him
3897684 its fine to defend the ermine but there are human beings whose wellbeing warrants priority and yet no one seems to care

3897686 the port macquarie taree atcs received 19 9 million in federal funding but only enrolled about 300 students
3897687 the reality is the building exists the certificate of titles is in the hands of catholic education and there are 350 students and 43 staff who are unsure about their future
3897688 i have therefore invited the deputy prime minister and minister for education julia gillard to visit the area meet with the various interested groups and see the facility first hand this should help in making a sensible decision for the future of our local community
3897689 it is continuing weve still got a few days left of the window and hopefully well get a result

3897691 directives on the use of the name of god in the sacred liturgy
3897692 some impact on the use of particular pieces of liturgical music in our country as well as in the composition of variable texts such as the general intercessions for the celebration of the mass and the other sacraments
3897693 an opportunity to offer catechesis for the faithful as an encouragement to show reverence for the name of god in daily life emphasising the power of language as an act of devotion and worship
3897694 by directive of the holy father in accord with the congregation for the doctrine of the faith this congregation deems it convenient to communicate to the bishops conferences as regards the translation and the pronunciation in a liturgical setting of the divine name signified in the sacred tetragrammaton
3897695 the name of almighty god expressed by the hebrew tetragrammaton and rendered in latin by the word dominus is to be rendered into any given vernacular by a word equivalent in meaning
3897696 lobbyists and the organizations they work for have disclosed nearly 100 000 contributions and other payments linked to members of congress and other top officials under a new reporting system required by last years lobbying and ethics reform law
3897697 only a little more that 2 700 of the reported transactions involved honorary payments meeting expenses and contributions to presidential library funds which were not previously required to be disclosed one researcher craig holman of the watchdog group public citizen said he has used the new database to calculate a total of 26 million just in direct campaign contributions by individual lobbyists to lawmakers over the first half of this year
3897698 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3897699 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3897700 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3897701 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3897702 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3897707 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3897708 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3897709 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3897710 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3897711 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3897712 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3897713 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3897714 we do not intend to pursue additional interests at this time

3897781 is not intended to prevent an acquisition of the company on terms that your board considers favorable and fair to and in the best interests of all stockholders and will not do so the rights plan is designed to deal with the serious problem of unilateral actions by hostile acquirors which are calculated to deprive the companys board of directors and its stockholders of their ability to determine the destiny of the company
3897782 una suerte de perversi n del comportamiento que lleva a las v ctimas de un secuestro a disculpar e incluso defender a sus captores
3897783 lo desgraciado es que esa mujer seguir a con ese agresor condenado
3897784 shell cant hide the environmental impact of their oil sand projects
3897785 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
3897786 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
3897787 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
3897788 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3897789 oil sands are an incredibly destructive source of energy and along with the expansion of shells oil refining capacity in texas cannot be considered a sustainable way to meet the worlds future energy needs
3897790 we are definitely focusing on the jatropha plant for oil production
3897791 enable more kenyans to enjoy and derive comfort from the supply of bio diesel for agricultural production employment creation rural urban balance and blending in the motor vehicle industry
3897792 research trials in mpeketoni lamu a coastal town where there is no power have shown people using the little oil they got from the seeds to light their lamps
3897793 the effect of deforestation and degradation as well as serving as carbon sink
3897794 the use of marginal land ensures that the high potential areas are not converted to energy production areas and therefore it guards against competition between biofuels and food production
3897795 we use a lot of diesel in the factory sometimes we pollute the environment we were looking for an alternative to cut costs
3897796 we thought it would reach full maturity after two years
3897797 it is too cold here the rate of growth is lower the results will be belated
3897798 in 2006 a kilo seeds went for 1000 shillings us 15 today half a kilo of seeds goes for 3000 shillings 46 its very expensive
3897799 they did not have enough scientific knowledge and they did not know the agronomy of jatropha
3897800 there is no ready market for biofuel in kenya yet
3897801 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3897802 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3897803 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3897804 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3897805 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3897806 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3897807 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster
3897808 contrario a lo que la gente pueda pensar la composici n no va de acuerdo al cantante no en la manera que yo escribo canciones o alg n compositor que haya conocido cualquier cantante que est en iced earth debe conocer cierto criterio o no tendr n el trabajo porque iced earth es una banda muy din mica significando que tenemos muchos sonidos diferentes as que un cantante mon tono que tiene una voz no va a encajar en iced earth necesitas un amplio rango para lograr las canciones como fueorn escritas cuando tienes talento como el de tim owens como matt barlow c omo hansi k rsch blind guardian con quienes he trabajado en el pasado estos son tipos que pueden hacer casi todo lo humanamente posible con sus voces as que como compositor que escribe m sica muy din mica de material que es muy melanc lico y muy limpio a muy pesado de muy alto y rasposo a limpio y alto de poderoso a medio rango es ese en el camino que escribo y el cantante tiene que que hacerlo o no estar en el lbum as que escribo las partes y luego la persona tiene que lograrlo no va a ning n otro camino no escribo de acuerdo a la habilidad de alguien eso ser a tonto limitar a la canci n

3897818 most car interiors are like dual cockpits where both driver and front passengers feel as if they only have access to 40 percent of the available space
3897819 the flow of venzas center console is a bit of an optical illusion
3897820 both driver and passenger will feel as if 60 percent of the space is in their personal zone

3897835 changes in consumer behavior have essentially erased five years of growth in gasoline demand
3897836 hopefully the era of the hummer and other gas guzzlers is over
3897837 small fuel efficient vehicles are not short term strategies for honda
3897838 were in that part of the summer where volume tends to be light conviction tends to be minimal
3897839 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3897840 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3897841 we cannot duplicate those services offered by oak hill in different schools
3897842 im satisfied and confident the investigators did what they could do
3897843 las manifestaciones de violencia revelan una crisis en los sistemas de protecci n operaci n y log stica de los grupos de criminalidad organizada particularmente en la vertiente del tr fico de drogas
3897844 i didnt expect it this soon but i know shes had a lot of pressure on her
3897845 it was nerve racking people you dont know and new teachers youre not sure how they are going to treat you
3897846 you had all the freshmen together so we got use to the school and learned where everything was we werent mixed in with the seniors
3897847 we examined from 8th grade to 9th grade and found a lot of kids were falling through the cracks and not getting a quality education all around
3897848 they have their own wing their lockers are there their classes and teachers are there
3897849 we knew if we needed to talk to someone they the teachers were there for us
3897850 they werent really aware of what was wrong with them
3897851 they go to check on the other children that were in the upstairs of the residence and find them in the condition they were in unresponsive
3897852 once we turned the gas back on to the residence and turned the pool heater on the level was extremely elevated inside the residence
3897853 carbon monoxide is a silent killer so therefore people dont recognize it and they dont know

3897856 pens bamos que la poluci n del aire era un problema que s lo perjudicaba a los pulmones ahora sabemos que tambi n es mala para el coraz n

3897858 el presidente est buscando o que me maten o que me yo me tenga que ir del pa s y del pa s no me voy a ir la responsabilidad sobre mi seguridad y sobre mi vida le corresponde al presidente

3897860 o suporte deve ter um profundo conhecimento das atuais tecnologias existentes no mercado n o ser simplesmente um atendente de call center que responda nossos chamados com uma frase pronta
3897861 quando chegou a hora de procurar um servidor para a empresa e o blog em 2007 testei o servi o da portof cil

3897869 we dont have to worry about iraq turning into another vietnam because we have an exit strategy
3897870 exposing and combating the leftist media has never been such fun
3897871 we are working on a resolution based on the one which is circulated already
3897872 you have a deal on principles now we need to have that cemented in the international organization which has the primary responsibility for international peace and security to make it legally binding
3897873 framework that really settles the matter and from which they can start the implementation of the peace plan only the security council can do it
3897874 if there is an agreement worked out i think we dont need a resolution
3897875 i have a huge crush on you dont tell my wife oh god i feel guilty please dont tell her i tried to kiss you
3897876 if we were skeptical about the strategic rationale for the cvs and caremark merger this deal while consistent with past efforts to consolidate the pharmacy market does little to change our view
3897877 were actually spending twice as much capital on the pbm business post merger
3897878 cvs has become a major player on the west coast
3897879 were very confident in our own growth strategy which is to expand primarily through new organic expansion while also pursing acquisitions that are the right fit
3897880 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3897881 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3897882 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3897883 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3897884 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3897885 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3897886 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3897887 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3897888 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3897889 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3897890 the right information has to be given to the people
3897891 typically we see copycats shortly after a major campaign but this was sent by the same people
3897892 but remember it took about three days for the cnn spam to peak
3897893 do not download flash player from a site other than adobe com
3897894 if you get a notice to update its not a bad idea to go directly to the site of the software vendor and download the update directly from the source if the download is from an unfamiliar url or an ip address you should be suspicious
3897895 russia lost because it infuriated the whole world and seems to be going back to its old methods europe has shown some hectic action and an inability to be organized and the united states was proven helpless and inefficient
3897896 for seven countries to come together without an eighth country that has happened over the last few days
3897897 i think that makes very clear to russia that there are political consequences
3897898 the events in georgia over the last 5 days have shocked me people throughout the u k and the international community
3897899 russias use of force in a sovereign and democratic country is unacceptable and unjustifiable
3897900 i think that the russia government is taking advantage of the fact that the u s soft power is in decline and that the eu has a very elastic conception of sovereignty
3897901 im worried we might be in a rock paper scissors situation and that they the russians are definitely on the rock side i think they are betting that rock trumps paper
3897902 the strategic assets of countries with oil are becoming more and more important
3897903 now putin wants to show the west that he also can show the west its limits
3897904 weve got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to sen obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president on jan 20th of 2009
3897905 as the russians move into georgia as aggressors and if you read the statements from the beginning from sen mccain and sen obama one had a kind of moral neutrality to it that comes i think from inexperience
3897906 the others sen mccains was strong and clear and principled and put america where america always want to be on the side of freedom
3897907 he said he was interested in volunteering but that was obviously a lie
3897908 not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante
3897909 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3897910 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3897911 you never think of something like this happening here in arkansas
3897912 many people know chris jericho as a wwe legend but he is also a musician and the lead singer of his own band fozzy
3897913 chris is someone who has worked hard to get to where he is today and that experience makes him a valuable resource and mentor for these women vying for a chance at stardom
3897914 the illinois born alive bill is virtually identical to a federal law he now is saying he would have supported had he been in the u s senate at the time the bill was voted on
3897915 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point to being born alive as defined in this section
3897916 barack obama had the opportunity to right a terrible wrong that was occurring right under his nose
3897917 but instead he used the power of his committee chairmanship to prevent illinois doctors and nurses to attempt to save the lives of living babies fully separated from their mothers leaving them to die alone in the dark in filthy conditions
3897918 barack obama is blatantly trying to cover up his infanticide votes
3897919 the heartlessness and callousness of this individual needs to be exposed the vast majority of americans care about protecting human life the news release refers to whistle blower jill stanek who is also mentioned in a column today in national review that also examines obamas abortion record
3897920 the tiny newborn baby made very little noise as he struggled to breathe he lacked the strength to cry he had been born four months premature at that age says nurse jill stanek their lungs havent matured stanek is the nurse who found herself cradling this baby in her hands for all of his 45 minute lifetime he was close to ten inches long and weighed perhaps half a pound its just a guess no one had weighed or measured him at birth no happy family had been there to welcome him into the world no one was trying to save his life now putting him into an incubator giving him oxygen or nourishment he had just been left to die
3897921 the problem with this kind of criticism is that precisely fits the narrative of monogamous marriage
3897922 as professionals we can do a lot to make sex workers benefit from prejudice free public or community services we can take action to oppose stigmatization in our environments and make better informed interventions to properly fulfill these womens needs
3897923 lets remember that all young people have rights to information education services and support these rights should be inalienable independent of young peoples hiv status their sexual orientation or identity or other realities in their lives
3897924 its so nice here the hospital i wish i could just stay here
3897925 companys overall relevance to parents who are committed to reducing the bpa exposure of children in their lives
3897926 standing on your own two feet and other life skills
3897927 uncertain democracy u s foreign policy and georgias rose revolution
3897928 how the showtime rotisserie oven taught me how to make compelling job descriptions
3897929 were dancing at a party at the manoogian mansion and that the mayors wife carlita kilpatrick threw a fit hit her and the other dancer then kicked them out of the house
3897930 does he face a murder charge or conspiracy to commit murder charge
3897931 they can place him there were giving away nothing they have many witnesses who place him there
3897932 hes my client i believe him i know that people are saying that doesnt make sense on the other hand a lot of people have problems with memory
3897933 someone was telling me that if you wrote a novel based on this the publisher would reject it they would say thats fantasy world
3897934 a brave man once requested me to answer questions that are key is it to be or not be be and i replied oh why ask me

3897940 i ended up on north campus in a triple which is something ive never been in ive always been in a double with a roommate that ive enjoyed
3897941 were also looking into area hotels that can give us large bulks of rooms so we can create a residential experience there
3897942 its going to have its pros and cons i mean now i dont have to worry about sheets or bedding or a tv but i mean theres that added effect im not going to be close by but its not the same as being home
3897943 will companies need more help with talent acquisition in 08
3897944 we found that it the wiki was great way to capture peoples knowledge so over time the person coming in behind them can benefit from their experience so as knowledge evolves the new information is over written on the previous information so you can see the evolution of it
3897945 m m m what i would do to you if you were my wife
3897946 adl program bir hayli ilgimi ekti kad n bak m r nlerinin ve makyaj malzemelerinin organik olup olamayaca n irdeledi ve sonu olarak birazc k tuzlu olsalar da kad nlar n d nyay ld rmeden makyaj yapabilece i r nleri bulup tan tt
3897947 the grand prize winning poster will be used as part of a national campaign to challenge the medias use of violent drug addicted starved surgically enhanced images of women and to fight against industries that profit from womens dissatisfaction with their bodies

3897951 la cabeza vuelve a estar en marcha en cuanto empiezan los partidos en los encuentros inconscientemente te preparas para competir mentalmente necesitaba un par n no entren muy bien pero cada d a me encontraba algo mejor y cuando empez la competici n ya me encontr mejor que cuando entrenaba

3897958 but over the christmas holidays she had homework to do every day i wasnt impressed
3897959 it would certainly look at some of the issues such as holiday time
3897960 kids are at school for 6 1 2 hours and some are on buses at 7 30 in the morning and get home from school at 4 30 or 5 thats a very long day and then they are supposed to do homework
3897961 our market and certainly kare viewers appreciate the kind of stories that emerge and build during every olympics
3897962 it doesnt matter if youre a young kid a mother or a father theres something for everyone
3897963 our goal at game developer research is always to arm the industry with the knowledge necessary to continue pushing the boundaries of game development

3897965 por qu google maps no muestra ninguna ciudad o carretera en georgia o en sus vecinos armenia y azerbaiy n nunca lanzamos cobertura de estos pa ses porque no est bamos satisfechos con los datos disponibles

3897977 todav a se est preservando el lugar pero por los datos que tenemos las caracter sticas f sicas nos indican que podr an tratarse de estas personas
3897978 el principal escollo que nos imposibilita continuar al frente es la actual conducci n sindical de los pilotos agrupados en el gremio apla
3897979 hasta que dichas personas no sean relevadas por otras que piensan m s en la empresa en sus pasajeros y en sus empleados aerol neas no tendr soluci n
3897980 si los gremios reaccionarion fue por la nefasta pol tica laboral que tuvo el grupo marsans al frente de aerol neas

3897982 its very embarrassing when you meet like a russian prostitute and she says shes a supermodel
3897983 we called them and talked to them and they did research and said yea not only do we think the area is good we like the idea
3897984 its really if i do say so myself a darn good way to get something done something very special without going to the taxpayer
3897985 if they put a target over here okay fine but that means we have to have large chunks of remaining acreage devoted to green space and parks and youth recreation
3897986 it was an accident i love both of my brothers and i know my brother wasnt intentionally trying to kill my brother
3897987 its unusual to have a brother shooting a brother twice in one night domestic violence is a big problem
3897988 i heard they were arguing or whatever and he probably didnt want to fight him so he shot him
3897989 best person to serve our state in our state if sen frist decides not to run

3898008 whatever destroys dignity and brings down the mighty from their seats preferably with a bump is funny
3898009 if you ridicule dictators bring them down with laughter they cant win you show how crazy they are
3898010 far from trivializing a conflict humor can be a very useful weapon in its pursuit

3898031 psychics like sylvia browne have been debunked over and over astrology has also been debunked over and over why should we even bother with 9 11 conspiracy theories
3898032 for example one of the most popular theories include the idea that the event was recorded with scale models in hollywood but many many home videos and eye witnesses have occurred in the years after 9 11
3898033 look at me look at me i need attention because i am smarter than these guys

3898038 but they are lending in a different way to the way they did previously
3898039 for some of them that is a conscious decision they may have taken it is not necessarily a bad thing in the current market
3898040 we are doing hundreds of mortgages each week we are still actively lending
3898041 but things have got a lot quieter in the last few weeks
3898042 people are holding back because house prices are falling especially first time buyers
3898043 we havent shut up shop and we are certainly open for business
3898044 our residential mortgage pipeline at the end of july was down 50 on a year ago we are expecting a quieter second half of the year
3898045 our lending has been very buoyant until very recently though the indications are that the market is quietening down significantly
3898046 we are battening down the hatches but we wont be undermined we are well regulated with excess capital and levels of liquidity at comfortable levels
3898047 we have to balance funds from savers with our loans
3898048 providing we remain in balance we are ok there is absolutely no issue
3898049 but as far as we are concerned it is not grinding to a halt far from it
3898050 it wouldnt matter at all in the short term one to three months but we are all concerned w have to lend money to pay out premium savings and maintain liquidity levels
3898051 the dramatic slump in demand is the biggest ive seen in 25 years
3898052 i think we are bumping along the bottom now but i think it will be something between another 14 and 18 months before there is any recovery
3898053 bush daddy has kept pestering me about the issue of living dismemberment probably thinking that this is what it means when psalm 53 5 says that god will scatter the bones of those camping against you bush daddy says this means that the limbs of the designated target will be duct taped and cut off each time the person revives another limb will be cut off and or shortened until he or she succumbs
3898054 as i learned when i tried for an ncaa championship in 1974 sports are not worth anything with bush nazis in the works

3898078 look you are trusting in deceptive words that are worthless hear o earth i am bringing disaster on this people the fruit of their schemes because they have not listened to my words
3898079 its just a little bit its not going to kill you
3898080 the one chasing after what is bad is in line for his own death
3898081 my word will not return to me empty but will accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it
3898082 an onward sweeping tempest that will not turn back until he will have carried out the ideas of his heart
3898083 arise o lord deliver me o my god strike all my enemies on the jaw break the teeth of the wicked from the lord comes deliverance may your blessings be on your people

3898086 dr francis cheney 1848 is also eulogized as one of the notable men of early dryden and that probably explains the cheney connection at the white house
3898087 que pasa sounds like a conspiracy to prove that japan is producing explosive gas tanks
3898088 a wild donkey of a man whose hand was against everyone and everyones hand was against him
3898089 these are the sh theads you want listen to them they talk like idiots

3898093 this is a lone demonstrator the leaflet does not request contributions or break capitol police regulations the applicant has an application on file with special events any questions should be directed to special events us capitol police
3898094 nine one one is there for emergencies not prank calls
3898095 really all thats done is push a lot of that gang activity into the excelsior
3898096 i like all our police up and down here but we dont seem to be getting a response from the brass
3898097 obviously she must have something more important to do than listen to our community
3898098 i am committed to this community just as all the officers in our department are
3898099 los testigos indicaron que el sospechoso pidi ver al presidente del partido ingres al edificio y poco despu s se escucharon tres disparos de arma de fuego
3898100 el sospechoso huy en un veh culo y fue perseguido por la polic a
3898101 hubo un incidente en la sede del partido y el presidente gwatney fue llevado al hospital
3898102 estamos aturdidos y afectados por el tiroteo de hoy la sede del partido dem crata en arkansas donde nuestro buen amigo y compa ero dem crata bill gwatney fue herido
3898103 solo un l der de peso dentro del partido dem crata en arkansas sino tambi n un amigo muy querido
3898104 do what im doing have meaning he believes life is a journey in search of hearts desire his favorite philosophy is that liberation from stereotypic life leads to salvation
3898105 and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3898106 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
3898107 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3898108 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3898109 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3898110 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3898111 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3898112 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
3898113 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
3898114 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
3898115 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3898116 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3898117 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3898118 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
3898119 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
3898120 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3898121 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
3898122 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3898123 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3898124 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3898125 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3898126 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3898127 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3898128 were doing our best to keep up with them and to best understand the situation its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3898129 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3898130 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3898131 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3898132 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3898133 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3898134 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3898135 we took up station guarding the opposed landing on the abkhaz shore when all of a sudden four high speed targets were detected we sent out an iff signal and the targets didnt react receiving a command from the flagship we got into formation and right at that moment the unidentified targets opened fire on the ship formation and flagship the cruiser was damaged and a small fire broke out aboard then fearing for seaworthyness the flagship withdrew from the firing area
3898136 we took up station guarding the opposed landing on the abkhaz shore when all of a sudden four high speed targets were detected we sent out an iff signal and the targets didnt react receiving a command from the flagship we got into formation and right at that moment the unidentified targets opened fire on the ship formation and flagship the cruiser was damaged and a small fire broke out aboard then fearing for seaworthyness the flagship withdrew from the firing area
3898137 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery
3898138 we have coordinated the text of the entire document with president saakashvili and introduced certain corrections
3898139 the ministers will approve the document it will become a resolution and will have legal force
3898140 we are signing this document about the basic principles under the conditions of the humanitarian catastrophe the most important aspect of the document is to cease fire the regulation process should be initialized
3898141 the russians have said that they do want to be a part of that prosperous and forward looking international community and frankly they are doing great damage to their ability to do that
3898142 there are any number of opportunities for russia to reverse course and to demonstrate that it is trying to behave according to 21st century principles
3898143 but i can assure you that russias international reputation and what role russia can play in the international community is very much at stake here
3898144 despite the agreements on peaceful regulation of the situation in the zone of the georgian ossetian conflict and contrary to the un charter georgias armed forces illegally invaded the territory of south ossetia on august 8 2008 using aviation and heavy artillery the armed forces of georgia attempted to seize south ossetia exterminating its civilians georgia has thus committed genocide of the south ossetian nation destroyed the city of tskhinvali and other settlements which resulted in a humanitarian catastrophe in south ossetia
3898145 in addition georgia attacked the military contingent of the armed forces of the russian federation which was deployed in the region in accordance with international agreements to normalize the situation in the area of the georgian ossetian conflict this is classified as an act of aggression as per resolution of the un general assembly of december 14 1974
3898146 the first principle not to use force the second to definitively stop all military actions the third to provide free access to humanitarian aid the fourth georgias armed forces must return to the places of their permanent deployment the fifth russias armed forces will be withdrawn to the positions preceding the beginning of the military actions the sixth the start of the international discussion of issues of the future status of south ossetia and abkhazia by means of guaranteeing their solid security
3898147 the operation which the russian forces were conducting has brought its results that is why we have ended it
3898148 it was supposed to be done today not yesterday or tomorrow we herewith made a temporal decision to cease fire until the problem is entirely solved within the framework of the principles which we have just named
3898149 as for the affirmation of the georgian president who said that georgia ceased fire in the conflict zone two days ago these are lies
3898150 the georgian forces were shelling peacemakers unfortunately there were victims yesterday in other words there was no cease fire with georgia
3898151 this is what differs those hell raisers from normal people it is very hard to stop them when they smell blood
3898152 all the rest will have no point without this condition south ossetian residents will hardly understand that they can return and restore their homes without this condition if georgia does not accept this condition we will be forced to take other measures not to let the current situation which has been formed as a result of georgias aggression repeat itself this is the absolute condition for everything else
3898153 the fact that the president of france has completely agreed with that is important we hope that the president of france will inform the georgian administration of these principles
3898154 we are bidding final farewell to the soviet union the ussr will never come back here we urge ukraine and other members of the cis to leave the organization which russia administers
3898155 russian forces are turning gori over to georgian police on thursday morning
3898156 the best elements of the original are back but have been upgraded to be better than before the new bosses add a more interesting challenge and the final level is one for the ages and of course the visuals are brilliant the remastered soundtrack is fantastic as well from top to bottom bionic commando rearmed is an incredible game thats well worth owning
3898157 bcr is unapologetically old skool from the inability to jump right through to the spiked pits that bounce you back a few feet minus a huge chunk of your health bosses have attack patterns health pick ups have to be earned and each level has been designed around blind leaps of faith and tiny margins of error
3898158 between the multiplayer modes and the challenge rooms theres more than enough innovation to make up for the minor irritations of the retro controls far from perfect bionic commando rearmed is still a much more complete and robust package than either 1942 joint strike or commando 3 and another impressive addition to capcoms download library
3898159 rearmed quickly wears out its welcome and devolves into a series of frustrations precision platforming is required for almost everything and failure often leads to death the latter half of the game is especially unforgiving although ironically the end level bosses arent nearly as bad as the path you took to get to them we recommend bringing a friend along in the excellent new co op mode

3898165 the desire for new bondage will cast a power full spell of possessiveness possessing us the mutely penetrated extra special feeling over them can be perpetual or ephemeral how ever it is we will enjoy living in the spell which enchants us giving a new experience of indescribable feeling
3898166 location is an extra thing that can transform every site on the web
3898167 were concentrating right now on making it as big as possible and getting the service used
3898168 there can be no assurance that the kftc will approve the possible transaction that an agreement will be reached or that a transaction will occur
3898169 you have a lot of companies out there manufacturing these boxes and theres nothing necessarily proprietary about them they only cost about 30 or 40 at most and theyre charging around 15 a month for them

3898172 we thought it would be a good idea to get together with some other mothers
3898173 get the kids comfortable with the playground setting and the other kids at school get rid of some of the first day jitters
3898174 one of the mothers gave us a call and at one of the play dates they handed out a piece of paper with other days and times for play group come if you can
3898175 definitely he was excited to come familiar with a lot of the other kids and familiar with the school
3898176 my nose was broken in about 10 places and i fractured my cheek bone and sprained my neck
3898177 each year in this country approximately 6 500 children are treated in emergency departments for a diving related injury
3898178 more than 80 percent of the dive injuries were from a dive height of less than or equal to 1 meter so that is you know not the highest dive thats not a platform dive this is the lowest dive height available at a pool
3898179 america has the second highest business tax rate in the entire world
3898180 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
3898181 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
3898182 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
3898183 im a democrat but i cant vote for obama after fisa
3898184 the problem with the huff and the democrat party is they produce only a stream of hypocrisy
3898185 the republican party is a party with bad ideas unfortunately the democratic party is a party with no ideas
3898186 wouldnt it be nice to hear that somebody just wanted to run the country responsibly and according to the will of the majority of its occupants
3898187 i dont think that as a country we have added to our appeal internationally by the iraq war thats pretty clear and i would say that a continuation of those policies is what has been somewhat and will continue to be the centerpiece of al qaeda keeping things going against america every statistic tells us that so yes common sense will tell you that mccains foreign policy is a danger though common sense seems to be void in a lot of these republicans
3898188 mitch mcconnell has been there 24 years and george bush has been there for eight and effectively what they are saying is that it wasnt important to deal with energy during the first 7 5 years but all of a sudden now it is important because it is election time
3898189 i think that mitch mcconnell is the quintessential example of a politician who will do anything or say anything to get elected and i dont think it is any more complicated than that
3898190 the reason he is not a democrat right now is not because he is philosophically like new york city mayor michael bloomberg to become an independent
3898191 he chose to become an independent because he got beat in the democratic primary in most states you wouldnt have the ability to do that he is not there by choice like someone like bloomberg he is there because it is the only way to get elected which is somewhat consistent with the guy i am running against who will say or do anything to get elected and so even though you might admire a lot of the things joe lieberman may stand for the process that got him there is nothing noble
3898192 anything that invades the freedom of americans whether it be privacy or anything else it should be handled with such kid gloves if there is any abuse of the system it clearly should be investigated you should have to be accountable for your actions
3898193 they have also had control as we know of the justice department and there have been plenty of stories that showed they havent handled that right so if you cant rely on leadership to be honest in what they do and how they do that is at the very core of the system but that is going to change they are not going to be the judge and jury of everything they do and what they have done beginning in january 2009
3898194 for the first time there has actually been a dialogue where both our leadership and iraq agrees that there is a timetable and here is what we want to do and we all ought to move toward it
3898195 and it was interesting that with all the opportunities that george bush has had to enter a dialogue and the opportunities that sen mccain has had to enter a dialogue it is interesting that it only occurred when barack obama went over there maybe it indicated that someone with some communicative skills who loves to reach compromises might be an important part of the next leadership of this country
3898196 anybody of the caliber of barack obama does nothing but add gravitas to our campaign and keep in mind the republicans dont have any policy to run on that has worked well for the average working man and woman for the country there are some people who think that the government could have taken a seven and a half year vacation and they would be better off today
3898197 minc is blowing a lot of smoke and pretending his agency is demanding a lot of rigorous measures
3898198 were dealing with a principal tributary of the amazon which has maybe the highest biodiversity of fish and among the highest biodiversity of birds in the world
3898199 if an accord does not happen the government could take the initiative to build the two works through eletrobras
3898200 the brazilian government really wants to get these projects done because of concerns about potential power shortages
3898201 my sense of this is that both companies will defend their interests and you might have legal action but therell be some kind of agreement
3898202 the discovery of this document provides further evidence of the prcs hypocrisy towards creating a harmonious society marked by religious freedom and rule of law
3898203 the fact the document was issued while the worlds focus is on china is a blatant challenge to the international community and an apathetic stance toward seeking to correct human rights violations even as world leaders are directly confronting the government at the beijing olympics

3898212 and it is now escalating into a political issue as south ossetia declared its independence from both georgia and russia
3898213 i am concerned that international aid might not be allowed to get to the region because of politics
3898214 i also am praying that the authorities can come to a peaceful diplomatic solution to this fighting
3898215 all we need to do now is to stop suffering stop the death of people

3898248 what god has done and is doing through this ministry is amazing when you realize that there are only two of us on our u s staff my wife joy and myself
3898249 ten years ago the u s acts office changed from hard copy print media to communicate via the internet and e mail which has proven to be very efficient and effective
3898250 since going online and starting in a very small way acts has received 23 401 salvation and re commitment to christ responses of these responses 3 507 have been received so far this year and have come from 119 countries that we are aware of
3898251 combined with prayer partners on the prayer encounter subscriber list acts has over 200 000 worldwide subscribers a big percentage of the salvation responses come from daily encounter subscribers as many non christians are subscribed to this list
3898252 unfortunately however in the past three weeks our major websites of
3898253 last year a phisher sent out 80 000 spam email messages making them appear that they were coming from an actsweb org email address
3898254 three weeks ago another phisher attacked us sending out pornographic spam emails making them appear that they came from an actsweb org email address
3898255 as a result all of the response pages on our acts websites were closed down as was the sending out of our daily weekend and prayer encounter subscriber emails in the process of changing to a new server we were hacked for a second time causing a complete close down of our actsweb org websites on the very first day of moving to the new server we were hacked again and closed down again
3898256 as of today our tech support team are little by little putting online only a small section at a time making sure that these are as safe as possible from hackers phishers and spammers
3898257 obviously the enemy hates the publishing of the gospel and word of god and as technology continues to get more and more sophisticated we can be sure that these evil malicious people will continue to do all in the power to block the publishing of the gospel thus all websites and e mail services that are doing the work of god are going to need more and more prayer for gods leading provision and protection
3898258 we are also in the process of setting up a special gospel outreach service for churches to replace our literature ministry that hundreds of churches have used this web service is specifically designed to communicate to non christians and the un churched with articles that speak to the needs of the average person in todays society
3898259 fortunately the good news websites have not been hacked or attacked
3898260 only through force and victory over the enemies is there security and repose

3898267 baptists of the world pledge their support for all in need with their prayers expressions of concern and their giving
3898268 we are very concerned about the whole situation and urge a peaceful resolution of the conflict

3898281 when youre looking at a campaign from the outside you consider well considered and well thought out intent in everything that everyone does
3898282 when youre looking at it from the inside you realize that much of what youre doing is what youre able to do at that time so youre always setting priorities then you realize that everything is not always part of the strategy a lot of times its just what youre able to do that day whether thats walking or talking to people or making calls
3898283 thats a lot to make up but i think that were going to target our message at unaffiliated voters and show them why our platform is more aligned with their interests
3898284 she worked really really hard to get the nomination during the primary and i have a feeling shes going to work pretty hard during the general as well
3898285 she and i obviously have a substantial number of policy differences on a substantial number of issues but i think thats going to be a lot of fun getting a chance to debate that with her
3898286 i think the district will benefit by a good quality debate on the issues
3898287 health care is going to provide a very useful contrast between the two of us
3898288 lois has campaigned very strongly on single payer im going to suggest another direction for the state moving in the direction of more free market reforms
3898289 new york gave me my words and my music and rock and roll gave me a place for that music to live
3898290 there really isnt a more fitting spot for this museum than new york the hometown of hall of famers like the velvet underground paul simon and blondie this is where ed sullivan met the beatles where lou reed took a walk on the wild side
3898291 you have to bring your computer in and have them manually remove the spyware that this was a major bad spyware that controlled everything on my computer
3898292 for 59 99 ill try and get it out but if i cant i have to erase your whole hard drive then you will need the windows numbers and you have to give me the disks and ill re install everything for you
3898293 you always say such weird things who thinks about things like that
3898294 and if it does the sea is just there were not scientists were idols we dont have to think about these things
3898295 oh sorry ai chan ill be out in a minute
3898296 we gotta finish our rehearsals for the song its just one more routine
3898297 i was jealous of you and kamei chan being together

3898299 great i just got out from practice wanna do something
3898300 its like the olympics for the qha quarter horse association
3898301 if only the music were louder quicker happier bouncier etc then more young people would come to mass
3898302 we always understood that soldiers traveling on duty were reimbursed by the military for the fees on required excess baggage however after recently hearing of the burden the military reimbursement process put on soldiers traveling to war zones the choice for us to forgo payment for a third checked bag from the department of defense was clear
3898303 how a big cock looks in my mouth and pussy
3898304 havent you ever seen yourself having sex in a mirror
3898305 no no this is different when i see myself in a mirror having sex i have to look up and it distracts me from what im doing this i can just watch
3898306 im going to take out the biggest dildo i have and fuck myself with it
3898307 how a big cock looks in my mouth and pussy
3898308 havent you ever seen yourself having sex in a mirror
3898309 no no this is different when i see myself in a mirror having sex i have to look up and it distracts me from what im doing this i can just watch
3898310 im going to take out the biggest dildo i have and fuck myself with it
3898311 if this is wrong then it is a good and noble wrong
3898312 in the future if you are not online you will not exist
3898313 so whats driving the spammers then according to google its partially due to the failure of spam detection vendors
3898314 you are here to do a job you cant walk out of a meeting because you dont like the way things are going to turn out
3898315 the united states of america stands with the democratically elected government of georgia we insist that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3898316 russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3898317 we do not want there to be any potential misunderstanding or miscalculation
3898318 i really do believe that the russians understand that pushing the envelope here would have significant consequences for russias standing in the international system
3898319 that may have been the product of the fact that the europeans have more leverage with the russians on georgia than does the united states
3898320 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected its leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors than what it thinks about u s policy
3898321 working people with annual incomes between 35 000 70 000 are often easily manipulated and misguided
3898322 no the homeowner was actually the victim in this case and he was defending himself
3898323 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3898324 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3898325 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3898326 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3898327 help protect the unsuspecting credit card user too many people have gotten themselves deeply in debt from credit card company practices please help the uninformed from getting themselves in trouble and unable to recover from their debts
3898328 now is the time to reign in these white collar criminal like practices of the credit card companies banks and card companies blatantly display a predatory personality when it comes to their ability to think of new ways to financially rape the public in fact they should be required to repay or pay penalties for their dark side practices sincere thanks for making them toe the line
3898329 i agree that 30 days late is late one day is not late i support the 21 day period that you are proposing for issuers to mail deliver the bill to me it gives me a chance to avoid expensive late fees and maybe even a penalty interest rate
3898330 the restriction on penalty rates as applied to existing balances is the heart of the proposed rule this protection will do more than any other to return some balance and fairness to the credit card marketplace
3898331 rather than prohibiting rate increases on existing balances the final rule should permit such increases if consumers also have the ability to opt out of the increase by closing the account
3898332 if a rate increase accurately reflects the available market rates for that consumer it is rational for a consumer to accept the increase and not opt out because if they close that account the consumer may not be able to get a lower rate with another card issuer

3898342 well i think what it says is were a state that gives high priority to education and we try to be the best
3898343 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3898344 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3898345 for whatever reason i think he has decided hes going to endorse obama i think powell has a high respect for senator mccain they go back a long way
3898346 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama

3898380 there is no other way of guarding ones self against flattery than by letting men understand that they will not offend you by speaking the truth

3898382 it is courage that liberated more than 50 million people from tyranny
3898383 our deepest values are also served when we take our part in freedoms advance when the chains of millions are broken and the captives are set free because we are honored to serve the cause that gave us birth so we will stick to it we will stand firmly by it
3898384 and i understand politics and it can get rough i read a lot of history by the way and abraham lincoln had it rough im not comparing myself to abraham lincoln nor should you think so just because i mentioned his name in the context of my presidency i would never do that he was a great president but boy they mistreated him he did what he thought was right

3898428 episode shows that if georgia seizes the initiative russia will not challenge it
3898429 wow georgias leaning to the west were going to lose them
3898430 well he probably bumped his vote up to get out of the run off but he would have won that run off anyway
3898431 you know what thats not how georgia changes its leadership and thats not how the world should work

3898442 the energy bill for the air force has gone through the roof even though we have been able to accomplish what i consider some pretty impressive reductions in the number of kilowatt hours used per year
3898443 make sure you get the best people from every entity that has to have input and get them immediately in line so you dont have to re explain the project every time you get somebody on the phone
3898444 this business model has been so successful for us we believe its the idea of the future
3898445 its not like were seasoned experts were kind of feeling our way along as were doing these first projects
3898446 because these are commercial deals theres no guarantee that any or all of them will actually go from concept to operation like in the commercial world you try a lot of stuff my expectation is that any deals we have on the table at any given time some will succeed and some will fail well just continue to have an inventory of projects to draw from
3898447 we did our initial studies and it seems like an air force base might be a really good place to do something like this
3898448 to at least lay the groundwork in this administration while my team is still here to pick the consortium and put together a timeline that will get us to the installation and operating capability on this reactor or reactors by 2018 its ambitious but we believe its doable

3898453 certainly we could have specified some of the requirements more thoroughly at the same time there were problems in functioning of the technology
3898454 we are in the process of negotiating that that process involves both discerning what parts will be left with the contractor and what parts we will assume either directly or with the help of additional expertise
3898455 were on schedule were making good progress on that and its been a very cooperative relationship between us and the contractor
3898456 weve intensified the management structure and made changes in leadership
3898457 weve made a number of changes to tighten up management and improved our ability to evaluate where we are
3898458 in an ideal world everything would have happened in a time frame that we would be able to test all of that
3898459 we are looking at that but we are not diverting resources from the decennial to do this assessment
3898460 we have not made a decision about whether or not we will use the internet but we wont employ any strategy where we cant ensure the confidentiality of data or that endangers the goals of the census

3898467 i feared we would miss out on sunday because channel 9 always wants a queensland presence on friday night and with the titans and cowboys going ordinary they werent going to pick them
3898468 with us we werent playing too well the last couple so they would have given themselves a chance i guess

3898470 i had been working on a play called polaroids that year it was the story of one mans life from birth to death each scene delivered through a monologue with other actors silently acting out the parts behind the narrator as he walks the audience through his life journey in the scene i had written a few nights before i had the man fighting with his wife they were experiencing unbearable tension after losing a son in a car accident the year before i knew in my heart they were not going to make it that polaroids would include a painful divorce that showed the ugliness of separation but i changed my mind after talking with paul i couldnt do it i wondered what it would be like to have the couple stick it out i got up and turned on my computer i had the lead character in my play walk into the bedroom where his wife was sleeping i had him kneel down by her and whisper some lines

3898481 the use of reason allows for a legitimate diversity in our prudential judgments
3898482 these choices include elective abortion euthanasia physician assisted suicide the destruction of embryonic human beings in stem cell research human cloning and same sex marriage
3898483 such acts are judged to be intrinsically evil that is evil in and of themselves regardless of our motives or the circumstances they constitute an attack against innocent human life as well as marriage and family
3898484 in light of the above we would commit moral evil if we were to vote for a candidate who takes a permissive stand on those actions that are intrinsically evil when there is a morally acceptable alternative
3898485 so when there is no choice of a candidate that avoids supporting intrinsically evil actions especially elective abortion we should vote in such a way as to allow the least harm to innocent human life and dignity
3898486 we would not be acting immorally therefore if we were to vote for a candidate who is not totally acceptable in order to defeat one who poses an even greater threat to human life and dignity

3898505 i had this idea that rock music like all art should talk about the same things that religion does

3898517 this is a beautiful book after hearing hellhound on my trail in high school i bought every vintage blues record available at the time upon receiving i discovered my knowledge only scratched the surface debra desalvo has written an invaluable reference book and its also great fun to read
3898518 dont think that the language of the blues might read like a dictionary or reference book theres no plot but you can open it up at random and fall into the world of your favorite blues songs and find out more about the lyrics than you would be guessing from context i learned a lot more about the blues music i already loved
3898519 finally one can understand the mechanics behind the overwhelming viscera of the blues deb desalvos work is a true guide book to the soul

3898524 phnom penh a high ranking official of the ministry of water resources and meteorology said that cambodia will spend more than us 400 million starting in 2008 for ambitious developments to create a huge first class irrigation system
3898525 at present the ministry of water resources plans to start building a big dam in the coming dry season with resources from qatar at the vaico river in svay rieng worth more than us 200 million which can deliver water to more than 300 000 hectares of rice fields and it plans to construct another dam at the stung saen river kompong thom with resources from kuwait worth over us 100 million which can serve 10 000 hectares of cultivation fields

3898601 i really do believe that the russians understand that pushing the envelope here would have significant consequences for russias standing in the international system
3898602 that may have been the product of the fact that the europeans have more leverage with the russians on georgia than does the united states
3898603 georgia is a democratic government in the caucasus that has elected its leaders to call it a project of anyplace of anybody perhaps belies more about what russia thinks about its neighbors than what it thinks about u s policy

3898696 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3898697 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3898698 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3898699 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3898700 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3898754 we consider people spending money on tourism travel anywhere as wonderful
3898755 what we have learned is that most people tend to take shorter distance trips take shorter trips or plan to spend less money instead of foregoing the vacation all together we still think americans feel vacation is a birthright and will still take a trip
3898756 typically there will be some resistance to higher prices but i cannot say if it would be significant enough to deter folks from enjoying the theme parks
3898757 our costs have increased so we need to make sure we are still a viable business offering quality service to our customers
3898758 we are still offering costs that are 53 percent of the three major theme parks
3898759 the theme parks continue to be a great value for families and for couples you can spend an entire day there for one price which is a huge value when you think of what you would spend on broadway tickets or a ski lift
3898760 people always say you never see what is in your own backyards and we in orlando have the benefit of living in such a popular tourism spot
3898761 these increases are less than the cost of a slice of pizza with the economy what it is people are looking at the total price the big picture and it is still affordable
3898762 you can tailor the orlando experience to just about any budget
3898763 orlando is showing signs of weakness but i am happy to say that it is still demonstrating strength when compared to other tourism attractions
3898764 it is a positive for all stay visitors in florida because if they do their homework they will see the various incentives and realize those savings
3898765 it was a week of training which otherwise i would have been training specifically for the time trial and certainly caused me a bit of worry as well

3898784 the middle class is so gullible like they believe everything he says and then when he has to change his mind you know like not staying in iraq he has to convince people that its what he said all along they dont get it sometimes he has to change his mind especially now that george has talked about a timetable to pull out of iraq now dad cant keep saying that we should stay there a hundred years like in his speeches those blue collar people wow they really swallow up every word and sometimes that gets him into trouble cause then he has to undo what he said its so gnarly in the spotlight dad cant even make a speech without people taking what he says as solid you know its not like hes a flip flopper

3898790 shell cant hide the environmental impact of their oil sand projects
3898791 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
3898792 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
3898793 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
3898794 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3898795 oil sands are an incredibly destructive source of energy and along with the expansion of shells oil refining capacity in texas cannot be considered a sustainable way to meet the worlds future energy needs
3898796 the philosophy was in these large natural areas fire should be allowed to play its role
3898797 what happened in 88 in yellowstone was probably a passing of the threshold with what the political and social world was comfortable with it was perceived that we were burning up their national park and there would be nothing left of it
3898798 every single day you couldnt believe that youd wake up and there was more fire new fires started
3898799 because people didnt understand it we didnt do a good enough job explaining it back then it became known as the let it burn policy
3898800 we learned a lot in 1988 about how much fire a park could take before they ran out of resources
3898801 i think the overriding message of our report was as big as these fires were and as important as they were in many ways they were not historically unprecedented and it was not unnatural
3898802 we very emphatically said and i think the 20 years since then have confirmed that the fires were not an ecological disaster

3898815 after seven years of blind alleys and false accusations we have to ask well has the fbi once again let their zeal replace evidence
3898816 a person who has been briefed on the investigation said on sunday
3898817 evidence amassed by f b i investigators against dr bruce e ivins was largely circumstantial
3898818 newly released fbi evidence makes a strong circumstantial case that bioweapons researcher ivins was a delusional sociopath who had the opportunity motive and means to be the 2001 anthrax killer
3898819 a flask of anthrax spores recovered in 2004 from ivins personal workspace at ft detrick the army weapons lab where he worked
3898820 bin laden terrorists for sure have anthrax and sarin gas
3898821 it may well be that absent a trial it will fall to reporters to aggressively test the solidity of the case against ivins
3898822 but this is a circumstantial case with no absolute proof that he did it
3898823 amy the fbi says it can trace the anthrax used in the attacks directly to dr ivins and it says he repeatedly tried to mislead investigators
3898824 tonight a lawyer for dr ivins says the fbi never found anthrax in his house or in his car or anything else directly linking him to the mailings
3898825 and without a trial well never hear what dr ivins wouldve said in his own defense
3898826 even when you look at the scientific evidence in that flask the anthrax spores that were in that flask charlie a lot of researchers in that lab also had access to it
3898827 oh by the way lets give you the reasons to why we think he sent out and went on this homicidal rage
3898828 well he helped develop a vaccine for anthrax he probably wanted to continue to see that developed so that by killing people by having come up with some unknown way of this high military grade anthrax we would keep the vaccine program going
3898829 hes involved hes got a role in it hes done something

3898835 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3898836 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3898837 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3898838 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3898839 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3898840 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3898841 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3898842 the forest service in an attempt to bolster an outgoing presidents environmental legacy rammed through an environmental agenda that itself violates the countrys well established environmental laws
3898843 it is not in any way overturned or compromised by judge brimmers decision in wyoming today
3898844 what it does do is create two conflicting court decisions in different federal courts different states both issuing decisions with nationwide impact
3898845 in light of the potential harm the roadless rule poses to our national forests due to beetle infestation and forest fires
3898846 we anticipate an appeal by either the united states or one or more of the interveners
3898847 i would say it further clouds the legal background for those states rule making

3898850 district managers who typically run eight to 12 restaurants were spending as much as two hours every morning going through e mails voice mails spreadsheets etc
3898851 we are definitely focusing on the jatropha plant for oil production

3898853 research trials in mpeketoni lamu a coastal town where there is no power have shown people using the little oil they got from the seeds to light their lamps
3898854 the effect of deforestation and degradation as well as serving as carbon sink
3898855 the use of marginal land ensures that the high potential areas are not converted to energy production areas and therefore it guards against competition between biofuels and food production
3898856 we use a lot of diesel in the factory sometimes we pollute the environment we were looking for an alternative to cut costs

3898888 knowing certain basic commands can prevent your pet from being injured or killed
3898889 its a good idea to take basic obedience classes with a new puppy or adult dog
3898890 if you were to accidentally drop something that may be dangerous like medication cleaning chemicals hot or sharp objects or toxic foods like chocolate grapes or onions this may be a life saving command
3898891 if a dog is obediently sitting she or he cannot be jumping on visitors or bolting out an open door
3898892 inside and outside the house its important to train your dog to have a good reliable re call most people use the command come it allows you to call them away from dangerous situations
3898893 an example of when this would be useful is if your dog was on one side of a street and you were on the other side and a car was coming you would not want to call the dog to you but instead would use this command to stop the dog in his tracks and make him lie down and stay until it was safe to call him to you

3898938 at the end of the day t mobile is using a technology argument to drive competition related issues
3898939 no incumbant carrier wants more competition to come in its very unusual to test the spectrum now part of the problem with t mobile is that in past tests they used a radio filter in their handsets which effectively was an engineering mistake and thats what caused the interference problem plus they havent conclusively proved that harmful interference exists but because they made a mistake theyre now saying that american consumers shouldnt be able to use the spectrum for a free broadband network
3898940 tragedy has again hit our community with the drowning of another young boy
3898941 for years there have been many abortive attempts to build a community swimming pool which have failed for lack of interest
3898942 some say the cost is too high what price would you say the lives of these boys are what is the value of your son or daughter
3898943 we in the fire department are making more drag hooks to locate bodies but we would a thousand times rather be helping build a swimming pool
3898944 it is with the deepest sorrow that we again feel moved to speak on the subject of a community swimming pool
3898945 the tragedy which has overtaken two more young people could possibly have been avoided if a supervised swimming pool had been available
3898946 we shed tears of grief for them and their families but they are also tears of shame and guilt because we have been standing back wishing for a pool and hoping someone would build one
3898947 we will have a pool built this year if the men of the community wont help to built it i am sure the mothers will
3898948 let not the death of these young people have been in vain
3898949 by the time this letter is printed we will have a committee formed to do the planning of the pool construction

3898983 with my colleague dr kirill rossianov i will be tracing the history of the gulags medical services
3898984 we know that forced labour killed many thousands in the gulag but paradoxically there was a network of labour camp hospitals and infirmaries mostly staffed by prisoner doctors and nurses keeping at least some prisoners alive
3898985 many gulag survivors mention these havens of mercy but no one has yet told their story through survivor memoirs and official archives we will reconstruct the world of the gulag infirmary and ask how places of healing could co exist with the mass mortality of stalins prison camps

3898997 its not really sore but just fatigued to be honest with you im surprised that i dont want to say i feel good that ive been able to make it through every practice so far
3898998 i didnt throw the ball that well this morning underthrew some throws
3898999 no pain but im 38 years old its going to be fatigued a little bit
3899000 we only have two practices left before the game and we do monitor that stuff
3899001 you guys talked to him more than i did so i dont really know where he is with that
3899002 legs a little bit fatigued youve got to figure im a little bit behind some of these guys im a little bit surprised that up to this point ive been doing ok
3899003 i wondered this morning when i got up what in the heck am i doing
3899004 the answer to that question is i love to play i hate to study at times i hate to practice but i love to play i know i need to study and i know i need to practice and i know how important it is that doesnt mean i have to like it the question i have to ask myself is am i willing to do that and the answer is yes
3899005 yeah there were discussions about me going elsewhere before i came here and all that i am happy to be here i really am its a lot different from what im used to did i ever think it would end up this way umm no but its not over yet and im excited
3899006 i think you can ask the receivers he still has it
3899007 but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3899008 i said look i heard youre not talking to the media
3899009 he said its not that its not that i obviously was joking on that i said look im not here to take chads spot or replace him or whatever it is what it is

3899011 al qaeda increased their influence and reach with words images and actions
3899012 relying on the private media to engage and inform the american public is increasingly wishful thinking
3899013 i think the scalability of some of these u s brands into international markets has been a big factor
3899014 specifically if you look at facebook and hi5 what theyre doing in terms of foreign language interface translation and their emphasis on cultural relevance in each of the markets theyre expanding to has helped them grow pretty dramatically across all global regions
3899015 translation opens the door and all the other things follow
3899016 they didnt offer translations until this year facebook was behind the curve not as localized as myspace or hi5
3899017 they were doing very well in the english speaking world but not until providing localized content could they tap into that growth
3899018 we have a member translation tool that allows users to translate different words it helps with colloquialisms and slang and different spellings of words and those get captured and flagged by users and then the community votes on the accuracy
3899019 even though many are u s based in terms of overall usage the u s market is a pretty mature market
3899020 its not going to sustain the level of growth its seen over the past few years but its definitely an audience to grow if you emphasize these global regions
3899021 it is higher than the last couple of months but by no means unprecedented february this year also saw six critical and five important updates
3899022 there are 500 plus vulnerabilities reported every month not all of these are windows related of course many of these are related to less prevalent systems but microsoft products still account for a large number of these vulnerabilities
3899023 only critical and important vulnerabilities were addressed in this update i am sure there were less severe vulnerabilities reported or found but it seems that microsoft has had to focus on only the most severe triage style it is important to patch these first however i should point out that most attacks are based on a combination of less dangerous vulnerabilities
3899024 critical patches address issues that can lead to malicious code being run directly on the victims computer the most serious form of attack
3899025 enterprises should apply the patches as soon as possible particularly the internet explorer patch because it addresses a vulnerability that has been publicly disclosed and affects the software that is most likely to encounter malicious attacks internet browsing is by far the most effective common way in which the average use will encounter malicious code

3899082 as governor of virginia warner used his experience in business to help deliver jobs and hope to the citizens of virginia his work creating jobs in southwest and southside virginia is a model for the rest of the country

3899084 i had a guy come up to me after church on sunday that said kyle busch has won me over
3899085 coach jgr owner joe gibbs talked about it at the team meeting
3899086 we know a good percentage of nascar fans dont have one favorite driver what hes doing is taking those fans and winning them over
3899087 he learned so many lessons from those two that hes practically a mini me of those without the polish of course
3899088 we actually had a bet when the mind games would start we know the playbook remember he was there for five years he learned how the game is played
3899089 we laugh about it sometimes but literally hes the first graduate of hendrick university
3899090 its actually a compliment that they would even go this route
3899091 kyle is doing a great job and is certainly going to be a threat for the championship
3899092 i still put jeff gordon tony stewart guys like that ahead of him because of the mental toughness that you develop while fighting for a championship
3899093 i went through it in 06 but from my own experience from 06 to 07 the strength i had mentally was so much stronger kyle hes going to go through that and have some difficulties through that
3899094 more people are getting to know the real kyle and who he is and who he is on the race track
3899095 many that contact us have been members of other fan clubs but are now making the switch cause they like what the driver is all about

3899103 youll never see politics or information on any of these networks
3899104 if we had no news division it would be important to show that speech
3899105 theres no telling when it will happen again it certainly hasnt happened before
3899106 its important for our viewers to be able to see both sides
3899107 he may well give a speech at the democratic convention explaining his endorsement of obama
3899108 this is not an absolute done deal but these people are very confident that powell will endorse obama
3899109 colin powell will not be at either convention theres absolutely no truth to this

3899121 darwins botched understanding of heredity should count against methodological naturalism which levitt misnames materialism
3899122 i count these people as id theorists just as much as dembski and behe
3899123 no i simply deny that there is a principled difference between rhetoric and science
3899124 after all darwins own theory was kept afloat for its first half century largely by an unholy alliance of capitalists eugenicists free floating racists and wishful theologians
3899125 why levitt should fear this prospect to such an extent that it compromises his critical judgment remains a mystery to me
3899126 i was gonna tell her that she shouldnt be meeting up with guys over the internet

3899133 my guess is if it were a cougar he kept moving and hes long gone by now
3899134 whatever it was peeled everything off the bone but cliffords head legs and tail
3899135 clifford had bites all around his neck it attacked his jugular vein and drug him more than 60 feet before lying down to eat him
3899136 it definitely wasnt another dog i can tell you that
3899137 this animal professionally peeled back the skin and ate the main parts of the body only leaving the head legs and tail it knew exactly what it wanted and went straight for it

3899332 barack obama had the opportunity to right a terrible wrong that was occurring right under his nose
3899333 but instead he used the power of his committee chairmanship to prevent illinois doctors and nurses to attempt to save the lives of living babies fully separated from their mothers leaving them to die alone in the dark in filthy conditions

3899351 companies like greenergy and tescos who use thurrock are profiteering out of the rush to biofuels causing food price rises hunger for millions ecosystem destruction and accelerated climate change these are crimes against humanity and the earth from which we may never recover
3899352 far from being a solution to climate change agrofuels are so damaging they make petroleum look green they threaten both to accelerate climate change and to trigger a global humanitarian disaster im delighted that this depot has been blockaded and i hope it sends a strong signal that agrofuels are a part of the problem not of the solution
3899353 agrofuels are destroying the very ecosystems which can stabilise the climate with the collapse of the amazon possibly just a few years away i am left with no choice but to take action
3899354 thousands of climate change activists are currently gathered at the climate camp in kingsnorth to oppose e ons plans to build the first coal fired power station in the country for 33 years coal is the dirtiest fuel there is opening coal fired power stations is madness we should be stopping climate change not making it worse
3899355 im risking arrest today because rbs must take responsibility for the emissions caused by their investments climate change causes the death of 150 000 people per year each one of the fifteen bodies lying outside rbs represents 10 000 deaths to stop this number increasing rbs must act now
3899356 location 199 broadgate court bishops gate near liverpool street station
3899357 the climate camp has always been about far more than just stopping a new power station at kingsnorth the fact that the royal bank of scotland has been targeted twice in as many days highlights the intimate involvement of well known high street banks in the destruction of our climate thanks to the billions of pounds they invest in fossil fuel projects each year we need to shift to a different kind of economy one that doesnt rely on endless economic growth at all costs and respects the natural limits of the planet
3899358 the fact that rbs have a special office dedicated entirely to funding oil and gas projects shows exactly where their priorities lie we need to radically reduce our use of fossil fuels to have any chance of avoiding disastrous climate change so it is completely perverse for rbs to keep pouring so much money into oil gas and coal were here to make them to take responsibility for their actions
3899359 even if you do not believe that the wars in afghanistan and iraq are counter productive as we do there is still the large amount of unnecessary flying

3899443 but they are lending in a different way to the way they did previously
3899444 for some of them that is a conscious decision they may have taken it is not necessarily a bad thing in the current market
3899445 we are doing hundreds of mortgages each week we are still actively lending
3899446 but things have got a lot quieter in the last few weeks
3899447 people are holding back because house prices are falling especially first time buyers
3899448 we havent shut up shop and we are certainly open for business
3899449 our residential mortgage pipeline at the end of july was down 50 on a year ago we are expecting a quieter second half of the year
3899450 our lending has been very buoyant until very recently though the indications are that the market is quietening down significantly
3899451 we are battening down the hatches but we wont be undermined we are well regulated with excess capital and levels of liquidity at comfortable levels
3899452 we have to balance funds from savers with our loans
3899453 providing we remain in balance we are ok there is absolutely no issue
3899454 but as far as we are concerned it is not grinding to a halt far from it
3899455 it wouldnt matter at all in the short term one to three months but we are all concerned w have to lend money to pay out premium savings and maintain liquidity levels

3899469 i dont think the results lived up to the expectations and upside scenarios that some investors had
3899470 that said it is a solid quarter guidance was slightly above where we thought it would be on revenue and storage fundamentals look pretty healthy
3899471 certainly ive seen a number of analysts say they expect us to beat beat beat

3899479 if anyone saw anything and they can assist us in any way in the investigation it would be very much appreciated because were looking for something firm to act on
3899480 but at the moment there really is a lot of people working on this investigating every possible aspect but theres no firm leads

3899490 i would have to say the area and the huge amount of different people that come here you can go to any school really to learn the basic stuff but if you go here youll live in san francisco and thats a hugely populated area with tons of people and you can gain a lot more from the diversity here youll run into many different people and youll learn things from them that you wont get in any class
3899491 we have a reputation as being a campus that thinks broadly and represents a wide range of student backgrounds and interests and we have some outstanding academic programs but we do know that being in san francisco is a large part of why people consider our university its one of americas favorite cities

3899504 aims to secure significant incentive based productivity gains over time while offering guaranteed pay increases to our employees and preserving their terms and conditions
3899505 of course we have contingencies for industrial action because we need to maintain essential telecommunications services to australia
3899506 let me make this very clear that any collective agreement would have nothing to do with awas or workchoices and our employees would get to vote on it
3899507 it will be entirely consistent with labor party policy and the law
3899508 i find it funny that all of these people are commenting on me saying im a terrible role model and yet none of them have ever been into my classroom and watched me teach and see how i interact with the kids
3899509 children of this age are basically curious and thats why cyber safety is failing
3899510 we talk about educating children about the internet but i think the department needs to educate their teachers on cyber safety and whats appropriate for a teacher to share online
3899511 if adults or siblings are giving our children access to facebook then it is a concern more widely
3899512 the school has taken appropriate action to ensure its teachers exercise discretion when posting material on sites such as facebook
3899513 if you are a teacher you are not privileged enough to have fun
3899514 its so strange for a young man to want to teach children
3899515 watch out that no one deceives you 5for many will come in my name claiming i am the christ
3899516 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened
3899517 die rotation ist notwendig weil wir in drei wettbewerben vertreten sind
3899518 wir wollen im hinspiel alles klar f r die n chste runde machen
3899519 man muss sich in den jungen reindenken f r uns w re es auch nicht leicht mit 20 jahren allein nach brasilien zu gehen
3899520 nein nur stolz auf das was wir erreicht haben ich glaube dass wir das alles noch nicht richtig begriffen haben ich bin vor zwei jahren nach k ln gekommen um in der bundesliga zu spielen mein traum geht nun in erf llung
3899521 man braucht tr ume und ziele und mein ziel ist nicht nur der klassenerhalt
3899522 wir wollen die liga aufmischen was karlsruhe in der letzten saison geschafft hat muss unser vorbild sein in wolfsburg wollen wir direkt zeigen was unsere neue mannschaft wert ist das ist zum auftakt direkt eine sehr gute herausforderung f r uns
3899523 der kader ist gr er als in der letzten saison wir haben die verst rkungen gebraucht ganz ehrlich ich bin froh ber den konkurrenzkampf das kann uns allen nur nutzen
3899524 bin ich das hat ja etwas l nger gedauert aber jetzt ist radu da und ich freue mich auf die zusammenarbeit mit ihm aber genauso wichtig ist dass manasseh ishiaku schnell wieder fit wird die saison wird lang und hart genug da brauchen wir jeden mann
3899525 wir haben als mannschaftsvertretung eine gemeinsame aufgabe das beste f rs team zu tun
3899526 da ist noch nichts geregelt das geht nicht von heute auf morgen
3899527 es muss ein st rmer mit hoher qualit t sein der unseren finanziellen rahmen nicht sprengt
3899528 aaron hat absolut die qualit t f r die nationalmannschaft es ist f r mich nur eine frage der zeit das gleiche gilt auch f r sebastian boenisch
3899529 wir haben jetzt genug qualit t im kader und genug taktische m glichkeiten wir k nnen hervorragend auf jede formschwankung und jeden gegner reagieren
3899530 der optimalfall ist ein ger st von sieben bis acht spielern um die herum wir variieren k nnen
3899531 der kader ist so ausgeglichen dass sich keiner zur cklehnen kann es geht schon im training richtig zur sache von der aggressivit t werden wir sicher profitieren
3899532 wir besch ftigen uns nicht mit denen wenn ich mir laufend den kopf zerbrechen w rde wieviel kohle die haben da wirst du ja verr ckt wir m ssen unsere hausaufgaben machen und dann hauen wir die zu hause weg
3899533 schade dass so eine mannschaft einen der 36 pl tze im profi fu ball wegnimmt
3899534 das 11 v timas oito s o mulheres todos teriam sido embriagados antes da agress o
3899535 j temos conhecimento que quatro alunos deixaram de estudar em diamantina depois do trote
3899536 die bundesliga war weit weg als ich im januar 2006 kam ich sah hoffenheim als sprungbrett um zur ck in die bundesliga zu kommen umso sch ner dass wir es gemeinsam geschafft haben
3899537 als ralf rangnick kam seinen trainerstab zusammenstellte und dann copado l w und salihovic holte sp rte man schon wohin die reise gehen soll alles wurde professioneller
3899538 ich bin heute klarer im kopf wei was ich tun muss um gute leistung zu bringen ich bin richtig fit mache dadurch weniger fehler spiele nicht mehr so riskant sondern klarer
3899539 seit ihrer geburt bin ich auch noch verantwortungsvoller geworden ich bin einfach ruhiger und berlegter
3899540 ich bin jung hoch gekommen und hatte viele leute gegen mich in waldhof weil ich nach lautern ging in lautern weil ich aus mannheim kam da habe ich gelernt mich durchzusetzen auch in salzburg und in der t rkei bei denizlisport wo ich auf mich alleine gestellt war
3899541 ich war immer ein typ der marschiert k mpft ich k mpfe f r den spa den ich im spiel habe f r die mannschaft meine familie dass es ihr gut geht
3899542 das erste lie ich mir mit 15 stechen ein drache am rechten schienbein
3899543 ich w rde am liebsten von allen leuten die mir etwas bedeuten ein tattoo tragen
3899544 sie tr gt auch meine initialen wir tragen das statt eheringen wir haben zwar welche aber nicht am finger
3899545 sein vater hat ihn gezeugt und dabei eine zeitmaschine produziert
3899546 er ist auch nur ein mensch aber vielleicht von einem anderen planeten
3899547 seit ich ihn schwimmen sehe denke ich dass das die reine perfektion ist er ist der gro e fisch im wasser
3899548 dass ich jetzt der gr te bin h rt sich ziemlich schr g an aber irgendwie auch cool
3899549 die letzten 100 meter im schmetterling finale habe ich nichts mehr gesehen weil wasser in meiner schwimmbrille war
3899550 er hat keine zeit f r frauen er schl ft er isst und er schwimmt
3899551 er liegt wie ein surfbrett im wasser und er hat eine unglaubliche gleitf higkeit bei jedem start und bei jeder wende ist er eine halbe sekunde schneller das kann man nicht trainieren
3899552 in deutschland geht es den jungs noch zu gut die sportler aus den l ndern der ehemaligen sowjetunion oder kuba k nnen sich noch richtig qu len wollen mit boxen geld und ein besseres leben sichern
3899553 na klar die besten wie sdunek wolke wegner sind bei den profis gelandet auch da ist nichts nachgewachsen das kapital an trainern und aktiven aus der ehemaligen ddr ist jetzt aufgebraucht in duisburg beispielsweise k mmert sich im nachwuchs ein trainer um 50 leute da kann doch nichts rauskommen die jungs verlieren schnell die lust
3899554 stimmt es war die schwerste meiner karriere erst der streitfall asamoah dann die beiden operationen mit einem halben jahr pause
3899555 dass der bundestrainer meinen namen wieder ins spiel gebracht hat obwohl ich so lange verletzt gewesen bin freut mich spornt mich noch mehr an ich will in die nationalmannschaft es gibt doch nichts sch neres als den bundesadler auf der brust zu tragen
3899556 die konkurrenz ist gro aber wenn ich gesund bleibe brauche ich mich hinter niemandem zu verstecken und es ist sicher auch nicht hinderlich dass ich im gegensatz zu anderen konkurrenten wieder international spiele
3899557 da bin ich wirklich ganz entspannt ich bin 28 jahre alt im besten torwart alter will noch zehn jahre auf h chstem niveau spielen alles andere lasse ich in ruhe auf mich zukommen
3899558 drei punkte der fehlstart letzte saison gegen duisburg muss warnung genug sein
3899559 er ist eine ehrliche haut der sein herz auf seiner zunge tr gt und alles sofort anspricht solche typen mag ich weil ich auch so bin ich bin berzeugt dass wir eine erfolgreiche saison spielen und attraktiven fu ball zeigen werden
3899560 o petr leo subindo realmente piora um pouco a situa o dos juros futuros
3899561 o volume est ruim o mercado ensaiou uma alta mais forte mas subiu pouco
3899562 der eine oder andere war unter form und wurde davor wohl etwas bersch tzt es ist ein hartes ringen um die startpl tze und es kann einige treffen mit denen keiner rechnet
3899563 machen wir uns doch nichts vor wir sind von real zeitweise vorgef hrt worden dass es nur so gekracht hat
3899564 ich muss gut berlegen bei meinen entscheidungen ich hoffe dass ich die richtigen treffe
3899565 n o traga material da it lia eles s o falsos

3899569 whats this wisdom that has been given him that he even does miracles isnt this the carpenter isnt this marys son and the brother of james joseph judas and simon arent his sisters here with us
3899570 ask and it will be given to you seek and you will find knock and the door will be opened to you for everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks the door will be opened

3899574 als bayern spieler w re ich nicht so bestraft werden
3899575 als bayern spieler w re ich nicht so bestraft worden
3899576 bei einem gro en spieler h tte premiere die szene gar nicht gezeigt ich bin in m nchen auch mal angespuckt worden da kam nichts im fernsehen als bayern spieler w re ich nicht so bestraft worden
3899577 wenn hoene und hitzfeld aufspringen dann bekommt der schiri wohl angst nur deshalb habe ich rot gesehen bayern plus schiri ist unschlagbar
3899578 ich habe in den anh rungsbogen geschrieben dass es ein relativ normaler zweikampf war in dem sich lala losgerissen hat
3899579 ich verstehe das nicht und ich w rde mir w nschen dass der dfb auch mal die leute sperrt die sich permanent fallen lassen
3899580 ich merke die belastung schon das wird ganz eng bis samstag
3899581 ich werde dargestellt als h tte ich eine abmachung nicht eingehalten
3899582 es gab eine schriftliche vereinbarung zwischen dem hsv und dem belgischen verband meine abmachung war dass man die sportliche situation analysieren wird
3899583 es gab eine klare absprache zwischen uns dem belgischen verband und vincent und vincent t te gut daran sich jetzt wieder auf seinen job zu konzentrieren
3899584 der hsv ist seit fast 50 jahren in der bundesliga und hat in dieser zeit fast 100 mal gegen bayern gespielt sie werden auch noch 100 mal gegen bayern spielen belgien ist zum ersten mal seit 100 jahren bei olympia dabei aber keiner hat verst ndnis f r mich wenn ich berlege ob es nicht interessant ist das viertelfinale mit belgien zu spielen
3899585 f r mich war es sportlich logisch in china zu bleiben aber ich habe juristisch nicht die kraft und die macht allein gegen den hsv zu k mpfen
3899586 ich habe keinen konflikt mit dem verein und dem trainer
3899587 w re ich ein deutscher spieler der mit der deutschen auswahl bei olympia spielt w ren die fans sauer auf den spieler oder den verein
3899588 dass ich der einzige spieler bin der zur ckgerufen wurde
3899589 ich spiele nicht f r argentinien oder brasilien ich spiele f r einen kleinen verband der belgische verband hat angst vor dem hsv die brasilianer nicht auch schalke hat derzeit wichtige spiele aber rafinha ist wie bremens diego einfach abgehauen ich werde daf r bestraft dass ich mich um einen kompromiss bem ht habe
3899590 ich versuche mich zu konzentrieren ich mache meine pflicht bin profi f r diese jungs die ich alle gern habe werde ich k mpfen pers nliche sachen werde ich beiseite lassen
3899591 mit dieser originellen markteting aktion sind wir bundesweit vorreiter jetzt k nnen alle unsere treuen arminia mitglieder billiger kraftstoff tanken bei den heutigen spritpreisen z hlt ja jeder cent
3899592 seit 30 jahren besitzen wir den betrieb seit 30 jahren sind wir fan und dauerkarten besitzer und jetzt haben wir unsere eigene arminia tankstelle
3899593 wir m ssen uns darauf besinnen als mannschaft aufzutreten das geht bei ballverlusten schon im angriff los und wir m ssen bereit sein zu arbeiten zu laufen
3899594 wir liegen vielleicht bei achtzig prozent aber umso mehr muss man deshalb die richtige einstellung zeigen indem man einfach spielt schnell um kraft zu sparen
3899595 und wenn wir angreifen m ssen die anderen nachr cken es bringt gar nichts wenn wir jedes mal eine halbe stunde durchs mittelfeld spazieren
3899596 you gave me an expected result but you didnt tell me how to check for it
3899597 eu cheguei conclus o de que existem armas n o letais que s o superiores s armas letais na quest o da seguran a imediata me refiro a m quinas de choque que conseguem imobilizar uma pessoa ao passo que uma bala de rev lver n o imobiliza necessariamente
3899598 se a guarda n o armada a prefeitura teria que contratar uma empresa terceirizada para fazer a seguran a daqueles lugares
3899599 como resultado a queda no segundo trimestre ser de alguma forma menor do que tem amos inicialmente
3899600 dentro de mi criterio esta informaci n no creo que abone nada para el desarrollo del pa s en este momento
3899601 anda no ha contratado a ninguna empresa para la campa a en espec fico porque anda contrata de forma anual a la empresa que le maneja todas las campa as
3899602 quiero hacer de su conocimiento que la lnb no incurri en ning n costo en la campa a y que como instituci n gubernamental y parte de dicho equipo cerramos con todos nuestros materiales de publicidad con el logotipo del gobierno
3899603 sobre el particular muy atentamente hago de su conocimiento que dicha informaci n deber ser solicitada la secretar a de comunicaciones de la presidencia de la rep blica
3899604 no le enviaron respuesta tengo entendido que el se or ministro deleg en un t cnico para que le respondieran ya le vamos a hablar

3899613 devo dizer que os informes n o s o animadores sobre o respeito da r ssia do cessar fogo da promessa formulada
3899614 isso servir apenas para aprofundar o isolamento no qual a r ssia est se movendo
3899615 a garantia de que a r ssia respeitar os compromissos assumidos
3899616 enviei a secret ria de estado americana condoleezza rice fran a para um encontro com o presidente nicolas sarkozy
3899617 ela seguir depois para tbilisi onde expressar pessoalmente o apoio inquebrant vel dos estados unidos ao governo democr tico da ge rgia
3899618 durante a viagem ela empreender esfor os para conseguir a ades o do mundo livre defesa da ge rgia
3899619 no documento apresentado ontem noite ter a feira tanto em moscou como em tbilisi falta o principal elemento o respeito integridade territorial da ge rgia
3899620 pleno apoio integridade territorial da ge rgia dentro de suas fronteiras reconhecidas internacionalmente
3899621 a nica op o para prevenir atos similares de agress o e ocupa o contra a ge rgia integr la num plano de ades o otan
3899622 um drone georgiano foi atingido na noite passada este aparelho tentava reunir dados sobre as posi es das unidades de manuten o da paz e for as subordinadas
3899623 os dirigentes ucranianos tomaram uma nova e grave medida contra a r ssia
3899624 as inova es introduzidas por kiev visam a complicar gravemente as atividades pr ticas da frota em contradi o direta com o acordo
3899625 mantemos rela es diplom ticas com a ge rgia milh es de georgianos s o cidad os russos e vivem felizes na r ssia no entanto n o falaremos com saakashvili
3899626 houve muitas informa es dizendo que tanques russos estavam na ge rgia informa es que se revelaram totalmente falsas houve informa es segundo as quais o ex rcito ia atacar tbilisi que tamb m se revelaram completamente err neas portanto duvido muito da credibilidade das informa es procedentes da ge rgia
3899627 nenhum pa s pode reconhecer a integridade territorial de outro pa s
3899628 reconhecemos a soberania e a independ ncia da ge rgia mas a integridade territorial um caso parte
3899629 a oss tia do sul e a abkh zia nunca integraram a ge rgia enquanto pa ses independentes elas faziam parte da uni o sovi tica
3899630 oriunde merg si orice fac in fata vad doar rosu alb sufletul meu e colorat in alb si rosu rosu alb

3899633 it was a very physical game with twente man marking us all over the pitch with a lot of spirit and belief
3899634 but in the second half they could not keep pace and we were able to take over
3899635 we played with a very young team and did not lose our nerve then our technical superiority allowed us to score to goals
3899636 its better to cheat and win than to cheat and not win right missouri fans
3899637 you can major in gameboy if you know how to bs
3899638 i am nik richie b tch i do back flips in my sleep
3899639 secrecy self reliance and a well stocked cabinet full of hefty bags
3899640 i think the events of the last few days show that there are many places in the world where we dont necessarily anticipate this kind of conflict breaking out
3899641 it does require a steady hand on the tiller and an experienced one
3899642 the centuries old ambitions of the russians to establish the
3899643 but i do believe that we need to stand as courageously as we can on behalf of this little country
3899644 weve got a real clear choice to make and i say it respectfully to sen obama because hes a gifted young man but hes not ready to be president
3899645 this isnt a time for partisanship and sniping between campaigns
3899646 whatever we think at the moment we can all reserve that for a future time
3899647 mccain has been fighting for freedom in georgia for many many years
3899648 die oberste musste raus um den knochenbau stabiler zu machen
3899649 ich bin nicht nur zum ersten mal in deutschland sondern auch erstmals in europa
3899650 t j sucht in der offensive zwar oft den abschluss aber er hat auch das auge f r besser postierte mitspieler
3899651 they did pay attention they listened learned read and re evaluated their opinion
3899652 it does make you have faith in the justice system
3899653 this is a victory for californias students parents and education community
3899654 i hope the ruling settles this matter for parents and home schooled children once and for all in california but assure them that we as elected officials will continue to defend parents rights
3899655 california impliedly allows parents to home school as a private school but has provided no enforcement mechanism given the states compelling interest in educating all of its children and the absence of an express statutory and regulatory framework for home schooling in california additional clarity in this area of the law would be helpful
3899656 we want parents to have the freedom to home school but we dont want children to become captives in a home school that doesnt prepare them for work or civic engagement as a functioning adult
3899657 das hat mich damals nicht aus der bahn geworfen und das wird es auch jetzt nicht tun
3899658 ich habe keine schmerzen nur dass ich nicht mehr dabei sein darf tut weh
3899659 in gut zwei monaten will ich wieder auf der platte stehen daf r werde ich hart arbeiten und 2012 bei olympia in london bin auch wieder dabei versprochen
3899660 ich bef rchte dass uns das sehr beeintr chtigen wird
3899661 das ist ein klarer r ckschlag f r uns es wird eine herkules arbeit arne niemeyer und blazenko lackovic die beide neu bei uns sind schnell unser spielsystem einzubl uen
3899662 as demand for more highly qualified workers grows the lower skill levels associated with regeneration towns will make it even harder for them to catch up not least because their brightest and best educated leave for london after graduation nor is a change of government likely to continue supporting regeneration policy ministers in the current labour cabinet overwhelmingly represent inner city areas a future cabinet perhaps more representative of suburbs and the wealthy south east may not have the same commitment to high levels of regeneration funding particularly if economic circumstances demand a squeeze on public spending
3899663 there is no realistic prospect that our regeneration towns and cities can converge with london and the south east there is however a very real prospect of encouraging significant numbers of people to move from those towns to london and the south east we know that the capital and its region are economic powerhouses that can grow and create new high skilled high wage service sector hubs at the same time market mechanisms can be used to induce some firms to move out of the south east we propose a significant liberalisation of land use in london and the south east there are over 2 500 hectares of industrial land in london alone and 10 000 hectares in london and the south east together if only half of it were used for housing it would create 25 billion in value and allow half a million people to move to an area that offers much better prospects than where they live now such a market led policy would prompt many industrial firms that are based in london to relocate to where land is cheaper so some peoplewill leave regeneration cities some jobs will move to regeneration cities both are desirable outcomes
3899664 com os pre os dos fertilizantes t o altos n o conseguimos fertilizar e sentiremos os efeitos na pr xima colheita
3899665 o governo est muito consciente da situa o est apoiando os produtores com subs dios para os fertilizantes num sistema por hectare
3899666 o que tivemos de recupera o nos pre os foi em grande parte perdido por conta do aumento nos custos
3899667 teremos uma boa colheita no ano que vem mas a seguinte que ser afetada estar bastante comprometida
3899668 thirty years is pretty good and the show is still very popular
3899669 only a complete idiot would vote for the other guy
3899670 why cant i do to my car what i do to my computer
3899671 its telling us something about the shape of the future its a bellwether
3899672 we didnt get to sell books we sold a movement
3899673 dale had the genius to say these are part of the same movement
3899674 who would imagine that a book with such a prosaic title as getting a job could pose such provocative questions about social structure and even social policy
3899675 this short volume has much to offer readers of many disciplines
3899676 a fascinating exploration for granovetters principal interest lies in utilizing sociological theory and method to ascertain the nature of the linkages through which labor market information is transmitted by friends and relatives
3899677 is not used in such a way as to further any military purpose
3899678 well you see its like this when you give them bread it will expand in their throats before they have time to swallow it and their heads will blow up
3899679 well i guess ill just leave them on their own then
3899680 es w re der attraktivste kampf deshalb kann ich es mir sehr gut vorstellen
3899681 ich wollte schon mal gegen dimitrenko boxen ich stehe f r diesen fight immer noch bereit
3899682 all this sliming may make political sense while voters say they dislike negative campaigning polls show they are influenced by it still the constant tit for tat squabbling between the candidates is dispiriting and so convoluted than even political junkies have trouble keeping score
3899683 determino em car ter de urg ncia o regular prosseguimento do leil o do rebanho descrito nestes autos observando se se poss vel o pre o m nimo n o inferior a 50 do seu valor de mercado

3899685 tirando os efeitos falsos portanto ficamos com os fogos de copacabana estourados e explodidos ao vivo sem 3d e sem dublagem
3899686 im calling about a position we have available are you still looking for a position
3899687 well i am looking but i just graduated from college on saturday so i havent really done a big search yet plus i dont even know where you are calling from
3899688 lets draft a bunch of lissome young women and put them in skimpy costumes to gyrate for the crowd during time outs and on the sidelines
3899689 na foto bruni se oferece projeta o busto para a frente com os bra os ligeiramente para tr s essa mulher n o uma modelo a esposa do presidente
3899690 parece estar concorrendo para se tornar a futura marianne da fran a a nova encarna o da rep blica
3899691 essa foto seria uma extraordin ria publicidade para nossos cosm ticos os norte americanos ver o como uma falta de seriedade
3899692 a imagem n o diz nada procura agradar um pa s e seu presidente os franceses dir o veja como bela o novo pio do povo
3899693 carla quer dominar a situa o conforme a dimens o de seu ego
3899694 is not used in such a way as to further any military purpose
3899695 shell cant hide the environmental impact of their oil sand projects
3899696 oil sands are one of the worlds dirtiest sources of fuel and have a major impact on the environment
3899697 their extraction cannot be described as a sustainable process and for shell to claim otherwise is wholly misleading
3899698 but also the development of vast resources of unconventional oil and gas such as oil sands
3899699 the asas decision to uphold wwfs complaint sends a strong signal to business and industry that greenwash is unacceptable
3899700 oil sands are an incredibly destructive source of energy and along with the expansion of shells oil refining capacity in texas cannot be considered a sustainable way to meet the worlds future energy needs
3899701 we are definitely focusing on the jatropha plant for oil production
3899702 enable more kenyans to enjoy and derive comfort from the supply of bio diesel for agricultural production employment creation rural urban balance and blending in the motor vehicle industry
3899703 research trials in mpeketoni lamu a coastal town where there is no power have shown people using the little oil they got from the seeds to light their lamps
3899704 the effect of deforestation and degradation as well as serving as carbon sink
3899705 the use of marginal land ensures that the high potential areas are not converted to energy production areas and therefore it guards against competition between biofuels and food production
3899706 we use a lot of diesel in the factory sometimes we pollute the environment we were looking for an alternative to cut costs
3899707 we thought it would reach full maturity after two years
3899708 it is too cold here the rate of growth is lower the results will be belated
3899709 in 2006 a kilo seeds went for 1000 shillings us 15 today half a kilo of seeds goes for 3000 shillings 46 its very expensive
3899710 they did not have enough scientific knowledge and they did not know the agronomy of jatropha
3899711 there is no ready market for biofuel in kenya yet
3899712 the illinois born alive bill is virtually identical to a federal law he now is saying he would have supported had he been in the u s senate at the time the bill was voted on
3899713 nothing in this section shall be construed to affirm deny expand or contract any legal status or legal right applicable to any member of the species homo sapiens at any point to being born alive as defined in this section
