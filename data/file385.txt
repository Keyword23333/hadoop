3850026 here and there in training camp it would cut out but during the game at the stadium it worked just fine real well there were a few times when dallas came out of the huddle quick and didnt allow me time to have my eyes on the sideline so i just had to listen to the headset
3850027 it really helps us quickly to get the information to the field im not totally a technology guy but i appreciate the advances that have been made available to us the quarterbacks had that tool for a while now the defense should have it too to put us on an even plane
3850028 if it does break down i can look over and get a call
3850029 i do like it as a tool but i also like knowing we have the backup system in place
3850030 it took a good getting used to throughout the first few days of training camp i think its just a matter of understanding between myself and ted who is that voice as far as not overloading me with information but he does a great job
3850031 my first block was against dallas cowboys linebacker zach thomas
3850032 that guys been to so many pro bowls once you do that nothing really worries you any more
3850033 that was our plan coming into this game we go on astroturf next week at st louis and i dont know how much i want to play him down there

3850035 i feel great honestly as good as ive felt going into any of my five seasons
3850036 its a tougher gig for a young man to play in a big mans role at a young age 19 when their bodys growing theyre still developing theyre giving away weight experience the whole lot
3850037 a first year kid playing in the ruck pinch hitting in attack at times and hes not getting the ground time of some of the others
3850038 so when you look at his 12 possessions or 14 possessions and you say that was his game but when you analyse the time he might have played 54 per cent of the game which is a fantastic result for a big fella

3850084 once the kids came i kind of semi retired carvey says by phone from a hotel room in los angeles where he is working on the early stages of an upcoming movie comedy for paramount
3850085 i really didnt want to be one of those guys

3850087 i think when dana was working on his special he kind of fell in love with standup again says cobbs comedy club booker tom sawyer who regularly hired carvey at the club in the 80s
3850088 before he was kind of walking through it and now hes really passionate about it
3850089 i saw a movie and i had him for a day and i lost him it just hits you or it doesnt
3850090 i did snl i did some movies my kids have grown up ive saved a lot of money that will go over good and im having fun

3850092 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3850093 hopefully its temporary i certainly dont want to go through that all that often
3850094 you can trigger it from rolling over in bed you can trigger digging in the garden you can trigger it getting something out of the cupboard above your head so its quite easy to set off and its quite common
3850095 i dont know if theres any real particular cause for it but hopefully it will settle down in the next few weeks
3850096 its only very minor as far as if i get up a bit quickly i guess youve got to avoid any sudden movements for a little while
3850097 its probably quite a different group of people now if you look at the amount of people that moved on at the end of that year
3850098 they were that far off the radar it wasnt funny but weve been within probably a point or two points of the eight for three or four weeks
3850099 weve won two of our last three irrespective of how we won them and we know that weve got a reasonable draw
3850100 we know that all our road trips have really been taken care of and our form on the road hasnt been brilliant
3850101 weve got two home games at parramatta and two games at anz stadium so geographically we dont have to go too far
3850102 from that point of view weve got a reasonable opportunity to have a decent run in
3850103 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850104 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850105 im just going to think like im playing with my local club really once youre on the field and youve had a look thats about it
3850106 it was a bit of a shock hopefully i can back it up
3850107 its amazing im shocked about that to be honest even though he has been there for me for everything taken me overseas thats just awesome
3850108 theres some nerves in there but im excited i cant wait for it
3850109 ive learned so much already in just a short time being here hes kosmina changed my game heaps
3850110 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850111 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850112 im feeling good feeling fresh so ill definitely put my hand up for selection
3850113 by all accounts sydney has won the competition already the rest of us are playing for second place
3850114 we did run into a few hurdles and we didnt jump them too well last season
3850115 we started slowly and thats one of the things weve really addressed because with the season being so short you really have to start well
3850116 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850117 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850118 this game will also afford me a chance to see the players in a game situation as i have only just come into the team and need to understand how each player responds
3850119 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850120 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850121 im going to make mistakes at training and in games but the recruiter cannot afford to make mistakes
3850122 we dont know what sort of draft concessions the afl will give us yet but weve got to make sure that every pick is absolutely gold pardon the pun because we only get one shot at this and we have to make sure we get the right quality kids to the club
3850123 he brings strong leadership attributes and will play one of the most important roles we have in building the culture of this new club
3850124 i see this as similar to west coast in that were starting from scratch and ill be saying to young guys that theyll have the chance to be one of the pioneers
3850125 its a focus on developing and if i can get a leg up and impress the board that were heading in the right direction then im confident i can get into that third year
3850126 my grand plan is to win the flag at collingwood and then move up
3850127 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850128 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850129 i am not jose mourinho so why should people compare me with him
3850130 mourinho says i will win 10 championships i dont say i will win 10 i say i will try
3850131 we say we will try to win all the competitions we play in but ill never say i will definitely win this this or that
3850132 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850133 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850134 over the last couple of months where i havent been playing youre always looking for ways to motivate your teammates to get us back up onto the winners list
3850135 hopefully friday night i can be a bit of an inspiration to people and gee whatever it takes to get them up and winning im willing to do
3850136 the thing that occurred to me before i went out during the year was play it like it could be your last game
3850137 its been well documented that i had a lot of injuries and each game i addressed like it could be my last game and thatll be probably the main theme of it
3850138 everybodys pretty pumped up about the farewell not only just for michael we want to prove a point that were not chokers and that we can win games
3850139 coming over here and seeing the way he trained the way he played and how hard he went at the ball i just looked up to that and thought i want to be him when i grow up
3850140 i hope people are there because its going to be a very cold lonely night if im riding around in the car and its pouring with rain
3850141 but the supporters and fans have been fantastic for our club all through history and its a chance for me to say thanks to them
3850142 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850143 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850144 i look at shane crawford and theres no doubt he was ready to finish a few years ago but now he just plays his part in the side but he can see theres a premiership not far away
3850145 they are things that would make you want to keep playing
3850146 i always thought you know at 28 that i had the chance to come back but the last few years theres been some trying times
3850147 but i always felt that if i didnt have another injury id get there but i sort of look back as a whole at my career and wouldnt change anything form injuries wins and losses its just been a fantastic journey since 1995
3850148 i might have said no earlier in the year but this time next year if its going like it is now id say yeah im ready to go again
3850149 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850150 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850151 i dont see any reason why we wont be a successful partnership but the managers got a lot of options in attack so im really going to have to hit the ground running
3850152 hell get better this year which is great news for liverpool and got to be a worry for the rest of the division
3850153 he makes great runs holds the ball up well to allow support to get around him and when he gets the chance in front of goal hes deadly
3850154 they can spend 20 million pounds on players just for the bench but my belief is unshakable that we can compete with them
3850155 we are not the richest club and we have had a lot of work to do but i have kept my desire and my confidence that it is possible to win
3850156 the key is not to say we will win the title because the premier league is now the best and most difficult in europe
3850157 we have improved and progressed every year since i arrived the standard has risen massively and we have had to work to keep up
3850158 maybe our european success hasnt helped us because it made people believe we were ready to challenge for the league when we were not

3850163 we havent allowed them to implement the scenario of 1921 at that time russias red army entered georgia and the republic was annexed to the soviet russia kommersant and its true heroism
3850164 they wanted to take away abkhazia and south ossetia they needed to trample all over the country russias troops destroyed everything we managed to build these years schools hospitals kindergartens putin and his cronies told us bombs are everything youll see
3850165 they have razed the beautiful city of tskhinvali to the ground
3850166 the tried to annihilate us but received 400 corpses 21 shot down jets which were actually shot down with primitive tools
3850167 from this time on will mark the border between the good and the evil for the whole world
3850168 it was no invasion rather it was responding to russias invasion our settlements were attacked and we had no choice
3850169 i feel like someone just hit the big reset button on everything
3850170 i dont think he ever really counted on quite the success that he got but i dont think it would have mattered
3850171 it was one of the best things in the world to do
3850172 there is a little bit of a built in household name with smash mouth
3850173 but usually when people think of smash mouth they think of steve
3850174 it was just one of those things where either me or one of the other people in the band had to leave and if that person left then that band wouldnt be together anymore
3850175 my friends are in that band so i didnt want everyone to lose their jobs just because two of us didnt really get along
3850176 it just sucks cause those guys wont talk to me anymore
3850177 greg was a member of the group since day one and hes a very talented songwriter and musician
3850178 he just needed to go explore other things so i dont see there being any ill will
3850179 smash mouth was supposed to be this fun in the sun thing
3850180 and after a while you just get kind of tired of trying to write about happy stuff
3850181 people always told me you sound like a little kid you should get a lead singer
3850182 honestly im not very comfortable with it right now and i dont really know what to do about it gina says i should take some acting classes to get my self confidence up but i dont even know if i could do that

3850187 our 25 hours of counting iphone sales in apple retail stores throughout the country lead us to believe apple is on pace to beat our previous estimate of 4 1 million iphones for the september quarter
3850188 we believe apple will sell 1 78 million units at its u s retail stores and 0 90 million phones at u s at amp t locations
3850189 our estimate assumes each of the 2 200 at amp t stores will sell an average of 5 phones per day from the july 11th launch through the end of the september quarter
3850190 he has two options to stay and fight or quit and go home
3850191 if he fights back we are with him we will support him and that is the preferred option
3850192 using that power would be undemocratic under the present circumstances even though it is in the constitution the democratic process should continue
3850193 we have the numbers and you have already seen the tidal wave against him musharraf in the provinces

3850196 the last couple of years its been a good league but one of the downfalls has been the limited number of games in the season
3850197 so it will be good to have a longer season and i guess that helps australian based players in regards to making the national team as well
3850198 if there are more games there are more chances of making the national team as well
3850199 obviously the league had to land on its feet first we all knew when it started that eight wasnt enough but the league had to establish itself and i think its well and truly grounded now
3850200 its ready for another couple of teams and hopefully they get it right
3850201 hopefully theyre financially viable and all very competitive on the field and if thats the case its great news for the league to get another two teams and make the season a bit longer and more aligned with the european amount of games
3850202 i do support expansion but its just one of those things that if they can only have one team and they make sure its a strong one team then thats great
3850203 because at the end of the day you want to have a product thats a good product
3850204 i think we are definitely in a position to bring one in whether thats the gold coast or wherever it may be i think over time well see the league expand
3850205 that is why free weights are significant because their usage signifies that union is a physically more demanding game than league
3850206 im not bringing up bench pressing you are so so negative
3850207 are you so ready to be done with finals and school
3850208 i dont want to wish it away im enjoying it
3850209 we think crysis warhead is going to offer a tremendous experience to a wide range of gamers
3850210 fans of crysis are going to enjoy more of the open ended gameplay cutting edge visuals and huge epic battles from the first game while also finally finding out what kind of havoc psycho was wreaking on the other side of the island at the same time we designed warhead to be more accessible for gamers new to the crysis franchise it is a standalone game with a story that can stand on its own it has been optimized to run better on a wider range of pcs and we are introducing crysis wars a tailor made experience for multiplayer gamers within the crysis universe all at a great value
3850211 now i know you may be apprehensitive about going on night duty
3850212 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3850213 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3850214 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3850215 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3850216 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3850217 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3850218 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3850219 this is not the kwame kilpatrick i thought i knew
3850220 i enjoy short walks to make horror pictures at the beach
3850221 were smart enough to know that we dont know everything
3850222 but id had to predict being a tv host would have been low on the list
3850223 its odd to go from being behind the camera for 17 years to in front of the camera
3850224 its a totally different experience now i get to do this and this is my life
3850225 this is like playing in a toy store for me
3850226 we see if anybody is going to get hurt which typically is me
3850227 oh i needed that part of my thumb but little parts grow back
3850228 i thought you just waved a magic wand and it was done
3850229 but in the real world someone has to design it
3850230 this is why you go into design in the first place

3850463 thanks for all the hard work getting this patch out
3850464 unfortunately i think youve gotten a serious black eye today we were finally getting management happy with the idea of using esx for production servers and this set us back a little bit
3850465 as a vmware enterprise partner and vmware authorized consultant i can tell you this is a big deal for vmware to release a product that has such grave consequences for even a relatively small portion of the total vmware user population
3850466 this could have been prevented by not rushing an update to market which was intended to be free and compete with
3850467 this will cast doubt about the reliability of vmware in the enterprise
3850468 the gateway p 7811fx is a great choice for customers such as students and professionals who want a notebook that can handle all of their computing needs from creating videos and playing games to tackling work school and home projects
3850469 and while the new notebook is ideal for demanding gamers and enthusiasts who want the latest technology its affordable price also makes it perfect for digital media hobbyists and casual pc game players
3850470 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3850471 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3850472 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3850473 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3850474 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3850475 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3850476 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3850477 he wanted the lights on but he wanted them on when the dodgers came up in the home half of the fifth
3850478 what happens at wrigley field is it takes a while once you turn them off to get the juice back flowing i told the cowboy hes a good umpire but an electrician hes not
3850479 we drafted them for a reason we didnt draft them not to sign them
3850480 ive always admired the yankees obviously theyre my favorite team
3850481 i guess you can weigh it in somewhat but were just going to have to think it out as a family and use the help of our advisers and make a decision thats right for me
3850482 i thought i was bad ass until i hung out with those guys
3850483 they are the guys who smuggle illegals back and forth over the border
3850484 what border patrol calls illegal immigrants who have made it into the us they cant call them wetbacks or spicks because obviously those are racially charged names and mexican isnt accurate since a lot of illegals are not from mexico so they say tonk they call them that because its the sound made when you hit them on the head with a mag lite
3850485 i told you those guys were nuts anyway so there we are four trucks on this hill like 200 yards from the hole in the fence we are totally blacked out wearing night vision goggles and we can clearly see the coyote hustling about a hundred tonks through the fence the border patrol guys wait until all of them are through the hole and about 50 yards into our side when all four trucks simultaneously turn on all their spot lights and sirens of course the illegals shit themselves and bust ass back to the border and in the darkness they all run right into the concertina wire it was a fucking mess some of them did not make it
3850486 nope you think our force continuum is loose these guys shoot anything they want you should see their situation reports for deaths theyll take out guys with rifles at 100 yards and write in the report subject was threatening agent with a rock its a joke
3850487 i really love rihanna i think shes great and the girl duffy i think shes amazing and i like the new madonna cd i like leona lewis too
3850488 he totally instigated it and pursued me his friends would tell me that he liked me that he thought i was pretty
3850489 kelli and casey have been a couple on and off for a few years
3850490 this isnt a record to me its more of a fairy tale thats why i gave it the title it has
3850491 here look im not a giant waste of your time
3850492 i cant put something horrible on this its the first time im using his new mic
3850493 you have to do that one you have to record that
3850494 i cant be with you so let me take you with me in a song
3850495 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3850496 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3850497 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3850498 hes still sore in the neck but he said hes ok to play
3850499 yesterday was not good but this morning it was better
3850500 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3850501 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3850502 why dont you tie a kerosene soaked rag around your ankles so the ants wont climb up and eat your candy ass
3850503 buddy has been one of the most underappreciated and maybe underused pitchers weve had this year
3850504 there are a lot of guys who can do well when given the opportunity
3850505 i wanted to let them know they can do anything and thats there someone out there whos doing the same thing theyre doing and had this amazing lifestyle
3850506 to be honest i never had the idea of going to college
3850507 it just sprung on me my senior year in high school and mr young just wanted me to focus and work hard in the classroom and on the field he promised me hed get me into college not knowing it would be tennessee and that id be playing in a college world series
3850508 for her to get to the top and play on a top college team its like playing for the new york yankees
3850509 i grew up with a single mom and she takes me to a lot of travel ball so im always making sure im doing things so i can become someone big in life i want to be known in softball and so its nice hearing from someone so you know you really have a shot
3850510 its really cool to see that shes gone on to college
3850511 coming from tampa for the majority of our kids college is not guaranteed
3850512 they recognize that work is going to be on their part what is going to get them there so to hear someone can come up from playing softball to carry it all the way through to a college scholarship is really eye opening
3850513 its fun for me i get to play and be with teammates ive known for a long time
3850514 but its also really cool to meet girls from other places too its really fun
3850515 i need some advice for this terribly awkward situation many of us find ourselves in at a live music show the band starts busting out a very
3850516 can you believe that fiddy cent got shot nine times
3850517 limiting sonar use in breeding grounds and other key habitat areas is essential for the conservation of whales dolphins and other marine mammals
3850518 this agreement protects both national security and our most treasured natural resources
3850519 we get some areas to train and they get some areas that are off limits
3850520 the writer is minister of foreign affairs of the russian federation sergei lavrov
3850521 trusting the bbc is a trendy american thing to do
3850522 there can be little surprise therefore that russia responded to this unprovoked assault on its citizens by launching a military incursion into south ossetia
3850523 ostensibly this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
3850524 peaceful and lasting resolution to the situation in the region
3850525 the region of south ossetia which has enjoyed de facto independence for more than 16 years
3850526 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3850527 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3850528 fue un padre muy formal muy querido sus misas eran largas pero muy profundas y ayudaba mucho a los pobres
3850529 absolutely not if drafted i will not run nominated i will not accept and if elected i will not serve
3850530 not every fighting is warfare while georgia is obviously under a ddos attack and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3850531 coulda shoulda the nature of whats going on isnt clear but until we are certain anything state sponsored is happening on the internet it is my official opinion this is not warfare but just some unaffiliated attacks by russian hackers and or some rioting by enthusiastic russian supporters
3850532 what matters is that the internet is being used as a tool in warfare
3850533 lets not put a diminutive feel on these cyberattacks a ddos attack is still a serious event and according to some of the statistics provided very few web sites would have been able to withstand these onslaughts
3850534 these days it doesnt take a tank to participate in a war but only home broadband and a computer the internet can bring a war right into your own home in more than one way
3850535 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the rbn and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3850536 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services
3850537 al precio final hay que sumar las tasas arancelarias que dependen del tama o y el valor del aparato electr nico sin olvidar que las normativas de garant a son diferentes entre espa a y los estados unidos por lo que podr amos perder nuestra capacidad de reclamar en caso de aver a
3850538 la diferencia de precio no est justificada y muchas veces merece la pena comprar en los estados unidos o incluso en alemania
3850539 i just focused on a third set on getting there
3850540 to win here in singles or doubles is the same
3850541 he cant win all the time it is not humanly possible
3850542 i think now the pressure is off so watch out
3850543 but every match i go in thinking i can win and knowing that he is human
3850544 i would do leprechaun in a second if lionsgate is listening give me leprechaun
3850545 its just one of those fun popcorn movies i would love to bring back the fun popcorn movie extreme violence extreme absurdity but make it fun
3850546 you send him in a time machine and transport him to the old west there are gold rushes there are gunfights its awesome i have the whole thing already worked out
3850547 im happy to help him here in indiana and around the country but hes got a lot of great choices
3850548 in comici faccio una semplice scoperta non esiste nessuna opposizione tra la tonalit del comico e del tragico
3850549 there goes our gas and food budget for this trip
3850550 in september 2008 the republican party had a big meeting the republican national convention
3850551 and on that day my dad was officially chosen as the republican candidate for president of the united states
3850552 were two northern lads who got in a caravan and headed down to london to seek our fortune hence journey south
3850553 mora odr ati svoju rije i djelovati da se ova kriza prekine
3850554 stoji uz demokratski izabranu vladu gruzije i inzistira na po tovanju suvereniteta i teritorijalnog integriteta

3850556 ghost train to the eastern star 28 000 miles in search of the great railway bazaar
3850557 none of us likes to see the school district hurting
3850558 justified or not the community teachers and staff have lost some confidence at this point in time in the administration and board i had a long healthy conversation with the board and we agree we need to do whatever necessary to restore that trust with our school district
3850559 if they hadnt done this theres a good chance that the community would not have given an interim superintendent or replacement the chance they deserved
3850560 jim ritter has the trust and respect of our community its what we need right now
3850561 puts him in a better position to move us forward
3850562 my guess is jim wants to make it clear to the community that hes doing this for us and not for him
3850563 for those of us who absolutely love this district and pour our hearts and soul into it we see that mirrored in dr ritter
3850564 they say they love the institution but then they leave it
3850565 theres a lot of mixed feelings and a lot of instability
3850566 i think if one really loved the institution they would have stuck with it
3850567 this transition is really worrisome especially at a time when we need strong leadership
3850568 i just cant imagine getting stuck with a dirty needle and then going through the testing i cant imagine just waiting to hear the results to make sure that youre ok
3850569 just the emotional consequences of that would be pretty bad i wouldnt want to have to deal with it
3850570 the article suggested that it worked well it was low cost and it kept a lot of recycling and solid waste people from getting stuck with needles
3850571 were hearing a lot from people who have been saving them in their house because they didnt know what to do with them
3850572 were kind of giving them an initial amnesty to bring in all the sharps theyve been collecting and give them a red box so we can start them out clean again

3850575 being 40 thing but i hate how much harder it is these days to keep my weight in check plus i have family history of high cholesterol and diabetes to think about
3850576 they the diocesan authorities and the trustees of the diocese of leeds will have to decide what happens to it then whether it gets sold and so on
3850577 i am conscious of those among you who have invested so much of your lives and energy into these parishes which will no longer exist i am aware of your pain and your sense of bereavement at this time i believe these changes however to be necessary in order to put the church on a better footing to meet the missionary needs both of the present day and of the years to come
3850578 as you are aware the style of liturgy here at st johns is a little different from many of the surrounding parishes indeed radically different from st benedicts next door
3850579 we realise that there are those who think that the style of liturgy here has been imposed on us by fr mark this is patently untrue as a community we are wholeheartedly behind fr mark in his mission to serve christ his church and his people the parishioners comments appended to this proposal are genuine and heartfelt
3850580 he the bishop then opened a major period of consultation with all the parishioners in the pontefract and wakefield deaneries in september last year which ran until the end of november
3850581 he worked hard through the distribution of dvds the use of the website and the catholic post to put forward his reasons for adjusting the structures of his diocese and invited suggestions to ameliorate his proposals no such suggestions were brought forward this was announced in his pastoral letter of trinity sunday which described the changes he needs to make
3850582 happy birthday keir we hope you are having a lovely day love from grandma and grandpa xxxxxxxx
3850583 wow arent you old how does it feel being 8 grandpa
3850584 i have won some minor competition like bowls once grandma has won twice now
3850585 happy birthday keir we hope you are having a lovely day love from grandma and grandpa xxxxxxxx
3850586 wow arent you old how does it feel being 8 grandpa
3850587 the embedded republican vote in a presidential election has been fairly solid for almost three decades now so you would have to say that mccain has an edge but im going to tell you that the obama people have been pouring resources in here
3850588 the obama campaign has some potential to win some voters to change the dynamics by making a strong run in the big metropolitan areas here filled with high tech workers and the type of people who dont fit the classic old south new south model
3850589 shes a bit of a fool thats the only thing you can say
3850590 dont forget cokie roberts and the whole washington crowd live in a kind of an incestuous relationship to one another they talk to one another they see one another they know nothing about ordinary people
3850591 she was mentally and physically tortured by the head of the convent she was made to do all the chores in the convent and in the night she was sexually harassed by the head of the convent this was happening for the past two months and i came to know about it only after she committed suicide
3850592 this allegation i have heard only today tuesday and on television yesterday monday when we took the statement from pappachan he did not level this allegation anyway now that he has publicly aired this we will take his statement again i have asked the investigation officers to look into all aspects now we are waiting for the post mortem report
3850593 i will go to any extent to see that the truth is revealed
3850594 our observation which we had made sometime back that in convents inmates are being ill treated appears to be correct
3850595 this year we would have had an exciting presence with apb at e3 if we had continued with webzen as our publisher but given that we re acquired the rights to apb just this spring and closed a very large fundraising round 50 000 000 to secure apbs future the timing just wasnt right to attend e3 rtw is very excited with apbs progress and we have used our fundraising as a means to invest even more heavily in the apb development team rtw hopes to release more information later this year with regards to game play details and beta plans
3850596 those who pray never lose hope not even in difficult situations even situations that are desperate in human terms this is what the churchs history teaches us
3850597 in human terms their lives could be viewed as a failure but in their martyrdom shines the splendor of love
3850598 who write to me asking me to pray for them and they do not conceal their concerns their problems aspirations and hopes which they carry in their hearts together with the uncertainties through which humanity is living in this period i can assure all
3850599 that i remember you in my prayers especially in the celebration of the holy mass and the recitation of the rosary
3850600 it has been prayer that has sustained the christian people in their trials
3850601 ready for anything jesus is also here so far i have been able to pray and i have said ave crux
3850602 prayer was the secret of this saint a co patroness of europe
3850603 ave maria was the final invocation of saint maximilian kolbe as he held out his arm to the man who killed him by injection
3850604 as we prepare ourselves to celebrate the solemnity of the assumption
3850605 let us again entrust ourselves to her who looks upon us at every moment from heaven with maternal love
3850606 id just use broad brushed general terms for political reasons if you get real specific you give people things to start taking potshots at
3850607 in almost any public policy issue someone needs to take the lead
3850608 its not unusual for someone to lay out a plan and say this is what i want to do and i think frankly at this point the more specific that folks can be the better off we all are in approaching the situation
3850609 hulshof already promised that in just a few weeks hed have a health care agenda
3850610 the issue is that was 27 weeks ago and still nothing from him
3850611 has said all along that his plan will be bold and it will be comprehensive contrary to jay nixon whose plan begins and ends with hitting the reset button
3850612 casi dos tercios de los 113 modelos que no est n disponibles para el consumidor estadounidense son fabricados por empresas estadounidenses o por fabricantes extranjeros con fuerte presencia de ventas en eeuu
3850613 pone de manifiesto que la econom a espa ola no s lo se est parando sino que se est desequilibrando
3850614 no se ha dado a quien lo necesita y no consegu a el objetivo que se buscaba
3850615 o se aplican las pol ticas econ micas adecuadas que permitan a la econom a recuperarse un poquito antes y con mayor intensidad o el ajuste que al final se producir ser el m s traum tico posible
3850616 i do apologise to you for my 2003 letter which was poorly drafted and i regret open to interpretations which i did not intend
3850617 i expected an apology in which he admitted he got the whole thing wrong until that happens there will be no peace
3850618 the matter is not concluded yet and it is a lot better to try to make progress on these issues at a personal level rather than through the press
3850619 weve looked at these issues and we have the same rights as other citizens and will continue to exercise them legally and well
3850620 i want to sit down with my lawyer and look him in the eyes and confront him with my story and have it resolved
3850621 there is quite a journey to go we have to sit down in a room and be brutally honest with each other
3850622 three pages of isolated and fragmentary extracts from articles dating back as far as 1994 without any context
3850623 these isolated quotes are not meaningful without the contexts of the articles themselves from which they were culled in fact most of them are even out of context from the sentences from which they were taken
3850624 because the material is not likely to expose a person or persons to hatred or contempt based on sexual orientation
3850625 les donn es historiques en m t orologie ne sont pas valides il faut revoir les mod les pour tenir compte de la fr quence et de lintensit des v nements climatiques qui se produisent depuis quelques ann es
3850626 si tu ne penses pas comme moi tu es rejet tu es le mal
3850627 a va vous prendre quoi pour croire que le climat est tout d manch
3850628 vous lavez dit vous m me je suis une marionnette incapable desprit critique
3850629 his best time is 1 3 actually 1 33 seconds faster than mine now
3850630 hes capable of going faster but im a great morning swimmer i just broke my canadian record again in the semis so im looking forward to it tomorrow morning
3850631 i felt great in the water and powerful coming home im pretty pleased with myself it sets me up nicely for the final
3850632 among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion than if they deliver that pregnancy
3850633 highlight the importance of taking pregnancy intendedness and wantedness into account when seeking to understand psychological reactions to abortion
3850634 where fully fifty per cent of the study sample was lost and yet the authors still managed to declare abortion does not harm women
3850635 abortion never was a right not then not now and if they keep that sort of statement it casts a pallour on their work regarding abortion and mental health
3850636 stigma need for secrecy and low or anticipated social support for the abortion decision
3850637 predispose a woman to both multiple unwanted pregnancies and mental health problems
3850638 advocates of the view that abortion is violence to both unborn children and to women which could balance such biases are ominously absent
3850639 the apa position is in accord with that of one of the major political parties and in opposition to that of the other
3850640 when a prestigious organization puts out a report on a politically volatile issue at a time when political passions run particularly high any imbalance on the task force will not pass unnoticed we hope you will pause to reflect upon how partisan this will appear
3850641 currently the search for the missing 14 year old diver is ongoing with rnli lifeboats and an raf helicopter performing a search along with other vessels that were traversing in the area
3850642 ser aceptada por muchas personas en torno a unas 150 a nivel nacional
3850643 lo que quieren es quedarse con el menor n mero de trabajadores posible
3850644 ya se habla de que no se quedar n m s de 150 empleados en todo el territorio nacional
3850645 se han habilitado un par de d as de trabajo para esto
3850646 se ha repartido hace poco un beneficio de casi seis millones de euros
3850647 unitario es decir se ha constituido una nica mesa con una representaci n de los comit s de empresa y delegados
3850648 this report is rubbish from start to finish it certainly wont become conservative policy
3850649 conservative policy is focused on the good work of continuing the regeneration resurgence of cities right across england including in the north of england
3850650 no doubt some people will claim that these proposals are unworkable unreasonable and perhaps plain barmy
3850651 but the issue is clear internal migration has always been an important part of a dynamic economy
3850652 if we are to ensure that people in this country have similar opportunities regardless of where they are born we need to allow people to move from places with few prospects to places that offer more opportunities
3850653 i think the idea that cities cannot regenerate themselves is just nonsense and i think that people should see this report in that way
3850654 it is difficult to find anything sensible in this report
3850655 mass migration from north to south is the last thing struggling areas need it would widen rather than narrow the gap between north and south
3850656 all towns and cities should have the right to determine their own policies and their local councils should be assessed regularly and accurately and the results of such assessment explained to local people
3850657 freedom responsibility and accountability are the keys to unlocking the potential that exists in our towns and cities
3850658 my hope is that these settlements will help the survivors and their families begin to heal and move forward
3850659 i apologize again today to the survivors and their families and to the whole catholic community we must continue to do everything in our power to ensure the safety of the children in our care
3850660 the release of his georges deposition today is a significant step toward openness and transparency and helps the survivors and the church community in healing and recovery
3850661 i think it is harmful to the credibility of the administration harmful to the process and harmful to all the parties involved its just the worst possible thing to be doing
3850662 ummm witness intimidation witness tampering misuse of the attorney general misuse of state resources are you kidding me
3850663 were commited to trying to cooperate as best we can
3850664 stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that its sovereignty and territorial integrity be respected
3850665 if he doesnt understand the situation well have to go further
3850666 he doesnt seem to understand that the russian army is much stronger than the georgian army his tanks remain in their places his air force is dead his navy is also his army is demoralized
3850667 to leave it in such a condition would be unforgivable
3850668 classic world war ii type and baltic type ethnic cleansing
3850669 if the russian government continues to claim that 2 000 people were killed as the result of the conflict its time to provide some evidence its time to provide some data name age gender the circumstances of death
3850670 my guess is that it was presented as this is the best i can get
3850671 like no other time the georgians need to work together
3850672 the security of our peacekeepers and civilians has been restored
3850673 the aggressor has been punished and suffered very significant losses its military has been disorganised
3850674 the ability to do a test from a spit rather than from a blood test really opens up this field to women who traditionally had not been eligible or had not had access to the services
3850675 when you have a child you want all the knowledge possible so that you can take whatever care you have to
3850676 dont expect anything less than an absolute killer record the sound is damn heavy melodic and chock full of surprises lady cat man may look like an angel but shes playing like the devil treat our metal sister real nice she is part of the family now
3850677 trust australia to have the hot swimmer chick doing scandalous bikini shots
3850678 over a century of legal authority establishes that where a state voluntarily avails itself of the courts the state is subject to the rules of civil procedure and applicable cost statues just as any other litigate
3850679 the authority on which the state relies mulvaney v napolitano 671 a 2d 312 r i 1995 is wholly inapposite because it applies to a situation in which the state is a defendant and a specific statue delineates the claims that can be asserted against the state
3850680 i dont think it means were going to reignite the cold war and i dont think that were going to have kind of situation
3850681 but i do believe that we need to stand as courageously as we can on behalf of this little country
3850682 often widely attended public events are a riders way into the system
3850683 they get on it for the first time and say hey this is kind of neat i wouldnt mind doing this every day that could be a problem
3850684 basically all federal money is in jeopardy they dont mess around
3850685 wed have to find a parking spot close because thats hard on us older folks to walk far
3850686 its a little bit better for us to ride than to walk
3850687 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services
3850688 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor this has put transit agencies in direct competition with private charter operators for these services and transit agencies always win because public subsidized transit agency rates are lower
3850689 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price
3850690 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry
3850691 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore
3850692 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely
3850693 i dont want to beat a dead horse here but i think its going to be very difficult for them to have to make a profit and charge a reasonable price
3850694 however the phenomenon is still growing rapidly in other regions around the world especially as the established american brands turn their focus to developing markets
3850695 friendster is growing at an enormous rate in asia pacific and is clearly leading the competition
3850696 and if youve already bought it buy another one and if youve already bought another one get another one after that

3850706 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea
3850707 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3850708 last few times our family has looked at cars our final choice was not our first choice

3850710 we want to give movie and video game makers the tools necessary to animate actors and have their hair look and behave as it would in the real world
3850711 our graphics group at uc san diego helped to create computer graphics algorithms that do the same thing for hairstyles
3850712 to make hair that looks like hair you have to think in terms of individual fibers
3850713 you cant just blend the highlights from two different angles to get a realistic highlight for a point in between
3850714 our method produces strands attached to the scalp that enable animation in contrast existing approaches retrieve only the visible hair layer

3850718 we are assigning probabilities to long term projections to aid policy makers in assessing the risks that might accompany various courses of action or nonaction
3850719 if all scenarios are believed to be equally likely its difficult to plan
3850720 whether or not such rapid warming will occur depends on actions taken to control climate change
3850721 the climates inertia would lead to only a slow response to such efforts and guarantee that future warming would still be large
3850722 never underestimate the stupidity of people in large groups especially on election day
3850723 estou convencido que portugal estaria bem pior se a ac o governativa n o tivesse demonstrado o zelo a compet ncia e a coragem que demonstrou
3850724 we have sanitized the sink and have disposed of all other kitchen tools and utensils that were used during the incident
3850725 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3850726 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3850727 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3850728 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3850729 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3850730 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3850731 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3850732 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3850733 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis

3850750 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3850751 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3850752 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3850753 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3850754 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3850755 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3850756 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3850757 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3850758 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies

3850761 the united states does not allege that nars internet data exchange idx policy in its current form violates the antitrust laws
3850762 enjoin the association from maintaining or enforcing policies that restrain competition from brokers who use the internet to more efficiently and cost effectively serve home sellers and buyers and from adopting other related anticompetitive rules
3850763 select the listings they choose to display on their idx sites based only on objective criteria
3850764 were hoping that the judge takes a hard look at this
3850765 i have lost everything i have nothing left no office no truck no paperwork nothing only what is on me
3850766 the question is what are the politicians going to do will they help me buy new equipment i dont know please tell me
3850767 three years is unacceptable and were going to have spot audits and inspections that are done by surprise and at least done annually
3850768 its time for the government to acknowledge that this experimentation and flirtation with privatization has been a failure
3850769 its time to restore the regulation policing and licensing of these types of fueling facilities to a government body
3850770 it was something like supposed to be funny or something but never offensive in any way im sorry if anybody took it the wrong way and thought it was offensive
3850771 this parade represents an abuse of the memory of those ten brave soldiers who gave their lives for ireland in the h blocks of long kesh in 1981
3850772 those who claim to be honouring the sacrifices of the hunger strikers at a rally in derry city on sunday were responsible for signing away prisoner of war status under the terms of the 1998 stormont agreement
3850773 our joint terrorism task force is involved in this simply because the victim here is from another country and it just kind of makes sense that our terrorism guys would take a look a look at this
3850774 i dont see how anybody could do anything but look into the possibility that this is a potential terrorist attack
3850775 we cant comment on where the investigation might be leading us
3850776 in all three cases these are people who have stood up for what i think is right sometimes at political cost to themselves
3850777 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3850778 he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3850779 im stuck in this really really annoying bad wheel chair
3850780 he continues to support the ideals of the center but theres no expectation that he will be returning
3850781 soldiers dont have to shoulder the cost of any baggage when they travel
3850782 it trivializes what soldiers in combat go through it makes it a game and nobody knows better than the veterans that war is not a game
3850783 the vaes main goal is to educate the public on the u s army and provide them with a greater appreciation of the sacrifices our soldiers make in order to protect our nation
3850784 im pleased but a little bit concerned this is a good step if it brings the national park service to where they need to be to reopen the crown
3850785 but if its just another bureaucratic barrier then its not worth the paper its written on
3850786 i told you to forget about that forget about that

3850792 i like to think about virtual worlds what can make them better how to attract and retain new users its mind candy for me
3850793 i thought id love to see what people mean when they say a simpler interface is better
3850794 the best way to make an interface noob new user friendly is to make it intuitive and consistent
3850795 so that users understand what happens when they click something get an idea of the result and must not be afraid of causing some kind of damage
3850796 im strongly considering recirculating it back into the process maybe funding another contest or pay developers to actually implement some of these ideas
3850797 it takes the first encounter with sl out of the horrors of help island buggy huds and overall a poor experience
3850798 the thing is every single entry has a good idea or two or three or whatever
3850799 some of the contestants said we should develop a frankenviewer
3850800 we are excited to be nationally recognized by the rwjf for this project which is the first of its kind in the country
3850801 although some states have nursing centers that focus on gathering data no other group has a bistate center that serves as a catalyst and regional think tank for innovative ideas and implementation strategies all focused on improving patient outcomes for the most vulnerable patients

3850812 das olympische komitee ist aber bereits gefordert das ioc muss aus den erfahrungen mit china lernen und sollte mit russland etwas h rter verhandeln damit die menschenrechte in russland gesch tzt werden

3850817 have experience persuading congressman to make their clients needs priority
3850818 i think that the pro life position is one of the important aspects or fundamentals of the republican party
3850819 and i also feel that and im not trying to equivocate here that americans want us to work together you know tom ridge is one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
3850820 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice we just have a albeit strong but just its a disagreement and i think ridge is a great example of that far moreso than bloomberg because bloomberg is pro gay rights pro you know a number of other issues
3850821 john mccain believes roe v wade is a flawed decision that must be overturned and as president he will nominate judges who understand that courts should not be in the business of legislating from the bench constitutional balance would be restored by the reversal of roe v wade returning the abortion question to the individual states the difficult issue of abortion should not be decided by judicial fiat
3850822 john mccain shot from the hip a very aggressive very belligerent statement
3850823 its just an example they politicize these issues without understanding that national security is not something thats a political issue same thing with the surge its in keeping with sort of the path that theyve been on to politicize national security for their perceived short term political interests
3850824 well im more concerned about the situation there number one number two is people will make their own judgment but i think people will obviously conclude that his inexperience and his lack of knowledge of this region and the issues are very apparent but i think people will reach that conclusion
3850825 well ive always believed there was not significant appreciation of the realities of vladimir putin and i think that its very obvious that as soon as he came to power he went directly to the suppression of chechnya that was the utmost brutality we looked on it somewhat benignly because they were terrorists they were islamic extremists and all that kind of stuff but i think we have not appreciated enough that this individual is interested in restoring the russian empire and i dont mean to say steve that this is the re ignition of the cold war that were now going to have nuclear confrontation or a cuban missile crisis or anything like that and i dont think thats his interest either but i do believe that hes hell bent on the restoration of russia as a major power in the world with safe and secure regional interests in a region that is clearly aligned in the russian orbit
3850826 this is good but you know it was so easy

3850882 i feel like someone just hit the big reset button on everything
3850883 i dont think he ever really counted on quite the success that he got but i dont think it would have mattered
3850884 it was one of the best things in the world to do
3850885 there is a little bit of a built in household name with smash mouth

3850898 theres connections i can feel and ultimately i just go with my gut
3850899 i just try not to make a big deal out of it
3850900 we will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people

3850902 modern writers injure the smoothness of our tongue by omitting vowels wherever it is possible and joining the harshest consonants together with only an apostrophe between thus for judged in it self not the smoothest of words they say

3850918 tix honestly sincerely and truly believed he was acting to protect himself
3850919 we thought wouldnt it be great if there was a cheers for teens where everyone knows their name
3850920 we knew there were kids in the mall but it really surprised me
3850921 some are avoiding home situations or some have totally normal homes and are just rebelling looking for acceptance in drugs or a boyfriend or girlfriend

3850923 everyone needs to get away from their family every now and then
3850924 i probably would not be as happy as i am now its a lot more stress free than being at home or school
3850925 if they want to enter a faith based conversation they can but if they dont its okay too
3850926 the bottom line is that we want to show the love of jesus christ more than we want to talk about it

3850928 i dont always take the advice but i always listen to it were teenagers
3850929 theyre at that age where society is telling them choose this way choose this way its helping them wade through that crud
3850930 a conversation can happen while playing a video game or while ordering a soda
3850931 i think its been a good place a place for the kids to go without getting in trouble

3850960 its almost impossible to predict where the lightnings going to strike on the web
3850961 people want to harness the web everybody from my publisher to movie studios to groups like radiohead but nobody really knows how to do it its like trying to herd cats
3850962 the point of the exercise is to stimulate book sales its a combination of desperation and creativity
3850963 im not the first person to observe that books are in a little bit of a crisis and we want to be able to provide our content in whatever platform people are going to turn to
3850964 if youre a publisher and you dont have a little p
3850965 people who surf the net are hop toady about it theyll find something and alight on it for a while and then their interest wanes and theyll go somewhere else its so quirky as to whats going to work and whats not
3850966 but take someone like stephenie meyer the kids love her and they spend huge amounts of time on the web if she were to pull out a vignette from those novels and put it online like were doing that baby would go viral theres no question about it
3850967 a lot of steves work translates visually thats why so much of it has been adapted for film and tv theres a tremendous amount of detail that goes into the plotting and the characters
3850968 during the initial most difficult period you gave us a lot of strength and security

3850972 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
3850973 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
3850974 as to whether the recent violent attacks have any links with terrorist forces there is evidence to indicate that east turkestan forces may be behind these events
3850975 are not the kind of coordinated terror attacks that are being orchestrated by some kind of organization inside or outside of china
3850976 the han and the ethnic minorities including the uighurs are equal members of the big family in china and they are all chinese citizens who enjoy the rights and freedoms allowed them by law
3850977 right from the beginning i have always believed and also expressed the peoples republic of china the most populated nation very important so the international community should not isolate china must bring it into the mainstream of the world community
3850978 and certain principles such as democracy human rights religious freedom rule of law in these principle matters you should be firm
3850979 its not age per se that when you get to 80 its all over with
3850980 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3850981 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
3850982 anxiety is very clearly a big factor in sexual dysfunction for women and depression in men
3850983 and men can become very depressed because of sexual dysfunction

3850991 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3850992 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3850993 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3850994 we are currently studying the legal details of the case for extradition
3850995 this is our priority we will proceed as soon as possible
3850996 guaranteed to cause the biggest disaster environmentally of all time
3850997 the armed forces of the philippines and the philippine national police are conducting further clearing operations in the affected areas of north cotabato to ensure that there are no more hazards that may pose danger to lives and properties
3850998 with optimism we foresee that sooner the dispossessed residents in north cotabato will be able to return to their homes and normalcy will be restored in these areas
3850999 meanwhile addressing the concerns of the internally displaced persons ipds remains our top priority while the residents are awaiting their safe return to their homes we have started to infuse the humanitarian assistance and disaster response in coordination with the local government authorities
3851000 pnp and afp medical teams are working closely with local government units in providing assistance to displaced persons some evacuees of the cleared barangays have started coming back but only to check on their properties
3851001 about the sudden influx of returning residents because our troops have discovered a booby trap in one of the cleared barangays
3851002 there was also a foiled attempt by milf renegade forces under commander ameril umbra kato to take control of a stretch of national highway particularly midsayap kabacan highway
3851003 the pnp is also strengthening the defense system in areas not affected by the conflict to prevent incursions from repositioning renegades particularly the flanks bounded by maguindanao province and shariff kabunsuan district
3851004 while continuous clearing operations are being conducted to sanitize the entire area our hopes remain anchored on all possible peaceful solutions to every issue that led to this incident
3851005 das angebliche triple a rating hat sich im nachhinein als chim re erwiesen
3851006 wir sind prinzipiell an einem kauf von anteilen an austrian airlines interessiert eine entscheidung haben wir aber noch nicht getroffen
3851007 leider sind ein paar trainings technische entwicklungen an den deutschen vorbei gegangen
3851008 amerikaner asiaten und alle die jetzt weltrekorde schwimmen haben ihre nationalen ausscheidungen sechs bis acht wochen vor den spielen dann k nnen sie ihre form bis olympia konservieren sie verbessern dann nur noch einzelne feinheiten
3851009 unsere schwimmer konnten hingegen nicht an ihre form von den ausscheidungen ankn pfen mussten sich f r olympia wieder ganz neu aufbauen
3851010 sie h tten nur so schnell schwimmen m ssen wie bei den deutschen meisterschaften und wir h tten schon drei bronze medaillen
3851011 the project could be ready between 2013 and 2015 including construction of the mine plant and smelter and refinery
3851012 this represents both the most rapid and most significant expense savings ever realized for the airlines standing well in excess of any historic precedent for demand weakness
3851013 the industry today is a significantly different one than that which gave us pause last march both in our equity and credit views
3851014 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent
3851015 basically theyre being offered a pay cut that is something they will not accept
3851016 not one member across the state has told me they support this offer they feel theyre being forced to take industrial action to get a fair deal
3851017 paramedics we surveyed said theyve fallen asleep driving and made mistakes because of their long hours and workload
3851018 they average six hours sleep a night and often less than that
3851019 ambos simply want to make sure they can get enough sleep so theyre safe to drive and do their jobs properly it seems like a no brainer but its been rejected its bizarre
3851020 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent
3851021 basically they amp squo re being offered a pay cut that is something they will not accept
3851022 any problem with record keeping and documentation in aircraft maintenance is a concern because thats one of the things that underpins the safety of the plane
3851023 is it just a maintenance documentation problem or was there a failure to do any maintenance work
3851024 you cant just push them into the jungles and wait you have to search for them and completely eradicate them only then peace can come
3851025 the rebel military installations and civilian areas are mixed if the army advances further and confines the rebels into a smaller region then civilian vulnerability will increase
3851026 there are no restrictions and there is no shortage we send food and other essentials as per the request of the senior government official in those areas
3851027 the silence of the international community especially by neighbouring india over the displacement and suffering of tamils is disturbing
3851028 and behold a plague of boy like men descended upon the earth and spake only in bad metaphor
3851029 squatting monkeys tell no lies shot in santa rosa and shaped in a mill valley theater the special is out on dvd on tuesday he says in a phone interview from beverly hills he appears at wente vineyard in livermore on wednesday and at the mountain winery in saratoga on thursday
3851030 once the kids came i kind of semi retired carvey says by phone from a hotel room in los angeles where he is working on the early stages of an upcoming movie comedy for paramount
3851031 i really didnt want to be one of those guys
3851032 squatting monkeys tell no lies which was shot in santa rosa straddles the manic and reflective
3851033 i think when dana was working on his special he kind of fell in love with standup again says cobbs comedy club booker tom sawyer who regularly hired carvey at the club in the 80s
3851034 before he was kind of walking through it and now hes really passionate about it
3851035 i saw a movie and i had him for a day and i lost him it just hits you or it doesnt
3851036 i did snl i did some movies my kids have grown up ive saved a lot of money that will go over good and im having fun
3851037 and behold a plague of boy like men descended upon the earth and spake only in bad metaphor
3851038 de situatie in zuid osseti is op dit moment erg onduidelijk
3851039 de afgelopen maanden hebben we onder vier ogen met de zuid ossetische separatisten onderhandeld maar die gesprekken zijn op niets uitgelopen donderdag is onze minister van integratie nog in tschinvali geweest maar niemand wilde hem ontmoeten de separatisten durven geen beslissing te nemen zonder ruggenspraak met moskou
3851040 ze wilden georgi in een oorlog betrekken toen ze georgische vredesoldaten beschoten hebben onze troepen zich nog koest gehouden maar we konden het niet over onze kant laten gaan dat ze de burgerbevolking onder vuur namen
3851041 het is natuurlijk een controversieel besluit want je vecht tegen een deel van je eigen lichaam bovendien bestaat er geen conflict tussen het georgische en zuid ossetische volk want die konden het de afgelopen eeuwen heel goed met elkaar vinden het werkelijke conflict bestaat alleen tussen rusland en georgi het kremlin wil georgi straffen voor zijn onafhankelijke gedrag en weer een russische satellietstaat van ons maken russische vliegtuigen bombarderen nu vliegvelden en barakken ver van de grens met zuid osseti ze hebben over georgisch grondgebied gevlogen en terecht noemt saakasjvili dat een oorlogsdaad de internationale gemeenschap moet rusland oproepen het geweld te staken
3851042 de huidige situatie is geheel het gevolg van de politiek die rusland de afgelopen tijd heeft gevoerd
3851043 moskou heeft de separatisten bewapend en financieel gesteund en beweert tegelijkertijd een vreedzame oplossing na te streven de russen spreken met meerdere tongen wat er nu gebeurt is natuurlijk vreselijk ik ben tegen geweld maar als het niet anders kan dan moet het maar zo het vredesoverleg was in een doodlopende steeg beland de eindeloze discussie waarin we ons bevonden had nog 150 jaar door kunnen gaan vooral omdat rusland niet in een oplossing van het conflict is ge nteresseerd ze geven iedereen de schuld van de uit de hand gelopen situatie behalve zichzelf
3851044 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
3851045 gt onder de tien kilometer per uur kunnen de boetes wel wat minder daarboven steeds zwaarder en duurder naarmate de snelheid hoger wordt
3851046 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
3851047 with spore were looking way outside the game space such as tv movies etc
3851048 were basically planting the seeds to spread spore out to a much wider group of people than would ever play a computer game
3851049 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
3851050 would i turn my nose up at another round with shodan no
3851051 i would never do it either unless she really wanted me too i mean she would really have to beg
3851052 there was this chick over here the other night man she was crazy she kept begging and begging for me to piss on her
3851053 well i just put her in the bathtub and pissed all over her it didnt do much for me but she loved it she couldnt get enough of that piss man it was something else
3851054 i have a keepsake mold of caitlins hand that was made just before she died and its the one thing that i can look at and touch
3851055 besides pictures thats all i have left of her and it means a lot to me
3851056 i didnt know what i was doing the first time
3851057 there were around 100 people and i just opened up my house in glen ellyn and it was combination raffle and auction and we made 7 000
3851058 and he spends about six months a year on this project writing letters to people with ties to famous people to help out
3851059 we tell people they can bring friends if they want
3851060 i think it touches a lot of people because its for sick kids
3851061 and people love matt and know what hes been through and want to support him because they know this is important to matt
3851062 a lot of parents give back to the hospitals that took care of their children but matts been amazing
3851063 just the stamina that hes had year after year and the proceeds from the event increasing exponentially thats whats unbelievable
3851064 literally last year we were in a tight financial situation until we got matts 14 000 donation which was enough to keep us going where we could line up more funding
3851065 when you look at our budget which is in the low 50 000s the donation is a big chunk of our budget and unlike grants matt allows us to use the money for more than just the handholds
3851066 if done well it gives a very real replica of the childs hand that captures the lines and prints
3851067 she was kind of always up for anything when they asked if she wanted to go to opening day at the cubs game she was ready for it she was just full of life no matter what she was going through
3851068 they ask if you want a keepsake and we just said yes im so glad we did
3851069 its just like having a little piece of the person with them thats tangible that they can look at and feel
3851070 with children there are often so little memories because of how short their lives are and to have that actual concrete piece of that person is very meaningful to many parents
3851071 i know what it is for me and it may not be the same for someone else but i just want others to have this available to them
3851072 i know what happened to caitlin is not hereditary but in the back of my mind its there
3851073 i dont want to be a carrier for something that promotes this wicked disease its just always been a fear
3851074 but we also need the possibility of cataclysm so that when situations seem hopeless and beyond the power of any natural force to amend we may still anticipate salvation from a messiah a conquering hero a deus ex machina or some other agent with power to fracture the unsupportable and institute the unobtainable
3851075 in times of affluence and peace with technology that always seems to arrive like a deus ex machina to solve any problem it becomes easy to believe that life is perfectible
3851076 over the long term we cannot kill or capture our way to victory
3851077 what the pentagon calls kinetic operations should be subordinate to measures to promote participation in government economic programs to spur development and efforts to address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
3851078 the bad guys are lurking in everybodys network youre between six and 20 milliseconds from every creep and criminal on the internet
3851079 when people ask me what the safest computer to buy is i tell them one that you dont plug in thats the current state of computer security for the average business and home user
3851080 weve known it for a long time the web is big our systems that process links on the web to find new content hit a milestone 1 000 000 000 000 unique urls on the web at once
3851081 were proud to have the most comprehensive index of any search engine and our goal always has been to index all the worlds data
3851082 yo man we should smoke that stuff we got in the city the other week

3851086 i hope against hope that this man will stop fleecing others
3851087 lo m s importante de las 26 leyes es la incorporaci n del pueblo
3851088 yo creo que uno de los factores m s importantes que tienen las 26 leyes aprobadas por v a habilitante es la incorporaci n del pueblo la participaci n del poder popular activamente en una relaci n de corresponsabilidad entre el poder central y regional
3851089 its easy to recruit because a lot of developers here are creating software for mobile devices on java for example it should be a win win situation for them since device support for windows mobile is increasing
3851090 the isv program is open to all developers that have demonstrated worthy open source projects our goal is to help them expand their market
3851091 as a group we expect to be better on both sides of the ball this season
3851092 we have an experienced and talented team as a group we expect to be better on both sides of the ball this season
3851093 caitlin and katie add so much speed to our attack
3851094 they are tremendous athletes who we will look to for solid and consistent play throughout the season
3851095 caroline will be able to play both forward and midfield this season
3851096 her skills with the ball set her apart from most attackers in the country
3851097 her passing ability is phenomenal she also plays a vital role in organizing our defensive schemes
3851098 her ability to eliminate defenders and make plays is extraordinary
3851099 chelsea has improved both offensively and defensively since last season and will be able to help our midfield
3851100 becca and leslie will add a lot of options for us they have experience in many lines and we will see where they fit in best no matter where they play they will add a tremendous amount of hustle and speed
3851101 roz is a three year starter who will be relied on to anchor our defense
3851102 she possesses strong offensive and defensive skills with a high level of tactical awareness this knowledge allows her to organize the structure and control the pace of the game
3851103 meg is a two year starter in the defense for the hawks
3851104 this year she may be needed in the middle of the field to spark our offense and keep the middle of the field organized on defense
3851105 lauren roz and meghan are virtually interchangeable in the backfield
3851106 their versatility will allow us to have many different looks
3851107 maggie will be back this season she has the ability to distribute the ball well and the hawks will look to her for some solid defense
3851108 nicole and lauren will be called upon to raise the level of our defense
3851109 they both have experience playing defensive positions they have sound fundamental skills and are very eager to learn our system first hand
3851110 it will be a phenomenal feeling heading into this season knowing that we have such strong leadership in the goalkeeping position
3851111 she has taken her skills to another level her ability to organize our defense will be paramount this season
3851112 she plays the ball with great strength and has improved her communication skills in the circle
3851113 tori has an unbelievable opportunity to learn from two goalkeepers who know our program
3851114 we will look to her to jump on board right away with her goalkeeping skills
3851115 we prepare to be a top team every year in order to maintain that level of hockey you must compete against the best in the country the 2008 schedule is as strong as ever
3851116 in order to maintain that level of hockey you must compete against the best in the country the 2008 schedule is as strong as ever
3851117 myself and bono share a vocal coach whenever the high notes arent feeling that high or in the morning youre groggy you snort salt water up your nose
3851118 it cleans out cavities its a natural antiseptic for your throat
3851119 since the class can only rent the cable box directly from time warner manufacturers of cable boxes are foreclosed from renting and or selling cable boxes directly to members of the class at a lower cost
3851120 the population of folks that we work with with intellectual disabilities already feel like they have to overcome a lot of challenges to just get up to what most people get to have
3851121 it may just be a movie but again these movies make impressions on young people

3851126 its driven by more proximate factors such as if you become obese or youre smoking too much or you contract diabetes medications can depress sexual interest the aging process itself is not a major factor driving these results
3851127 if sexual health goes to hell it may be a canary in the mine shaft it may be a sign of health problems
3851128 anxiety is very clearly a big factor in sexual dysfunction for women and depression in men
3851129 and men can become very depressed because of sexual dysfunction
3851130 potential for tropical cyclone formation during the next day or two has decreased
3851131 its a step in the right direction the new laws are moving the scales of justice but theyve still got a long way to move before there is justice for victims
3851132 i want to make sure my sisters story is heard she was just an ordinary woman
3851133 i have already drafted the foreword and it is a good idea to document this familys struggle
3851134 this case is a travesty of justice if the message coming from the ministry of justice with the law reforms is they are reviewing the distinction between murder and manslaughter that is clearly a good thing
3851135 the trial lasted an hour and basically concluded it was claires fault she got killed because of her nagging no one spoke to defend claire we couldnt believe it
3851136 that would make a great scarf in a chevron stitch
3851137 you didnt think it was gonna be that easy did you

3851139 life moves pretty fast if you dont stop and look around once in a while you could miss it
3851140 the flooding in june and july which resulted in closing the floodgates forced us to cancel several rides along the riverfront
3851141 we will continue the weekly rides through the month of august
3851142 dont set up any more meetings with governors it makes absolutely no sense to do this if we dont have stability in the incentive programs
3851143 sure well need wind and solar energy but its just not cost effective yet
3851144 is to accelerate the introduction of new technologies for energy supply and use and deploy them on a very large scale

3851157 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3851158 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3851159 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain

3851167 the higher inventories are good news for second quarter gdp which could be close to 3 when revised
3851168 t he pace of expansion has been subdued and i would expect that to continue not just because of credit conditions

3851181 the cloud delivers scaling at low cost the cloud allows the workload to vary from large to small as you need capacity
3851182 with cloud computing there is the possibility of obtaining systems more flexibly on an as needed basis and then modernizing once better technology is available
3851183 the next generation of workers will be mobile by investing in the mobile force we can attract some super smart people
3851184 we have a responsibility to the public trust thats on a different level than the private sector
3851185 rather than dismissing cloud computing because of the inherent risks involved we should work to overcome them so that the government can more readily adopt it
3851186 for me on a personal level rizzos a guy that i watched when i was first starting in the sport and always looked up to him i think hes one of the most down to earth coolest guys ive had some mental blocks of whatever sort but i feel like ive got that situated and im prepared to do what ive got to do

3851195 the u s has been put in an impossible position
3851196 the u s likes georgia george bush has been supporting the government but theyre not going to go to war with russia over little georgia the u s needs russia for bigger games
3851197 russia has been in control of these regions keeping the peace and georgia wants those regions back and has a perfect international right

3851203 if russia feels it can just intervene with no effort at multilateralism then thats very dangerous for ukraine
3851204 this was a ridiculous military adventure by saakashvili that was met by a response that was pretty predictable

3851267 the reason pat mc mahon left celtic wasnt because he was sulking or impatience it was because of sean fallon who wouldnt know a decent footballer if he kicked him in the arse its well known in football circles that fallon hadnt a clue about playing football pat is a very educated guy and was a excellent footballer who would have played for celtic for many years to come jock stein was reluctant to let him go but big jock had to back up his coach whom pat had an argument after a game with dundee utd in 1969 pat said fallon was clueless then he tried to blame pat for the result against dundee utd pats only fault was he couldnt suffer fools im pats nephew so if anyone wants to get in touch with pat let me know

3851359 my understanding with insurance companies right now if you are involved in a motorcycle crash and are wearing one of those toy helmets they will null and void your insurance coverage for medical expenses and that includes icbc
3851360 do they realize a hospital stay can run between 1 000 and 10 000 a day if their insurance isnt going to cover their expenses
3851361 cigarettes have been determined they cost us too much with our health benefits and everything our insurance is increased because people smoke the government realizes that which is why theyve increased the tax and the cost of the things and passed legislation limiting purchase of the things i think its time the government both provincial and federal realize these helmets are starting to cost us in the same way
3851362 the motorcycle shop guy says here you want something cheap quick and legal here you go all theyre retailer doing is pushing an inferior product the bottom line for them is to sell products they dont care i can honestly say a lot of them dont care

3851373 we have dedicated people working to contact alternative suppliers to get more product from elsewhere were stretching out traditional supply boundaries to get more gas in from other areas both in canada and offshore in short we know this stuff is important to people and were doing our best to minimize the situation
3851374 the laws in b c at this time the court of appeal has ruled that a motorcycle operator may wear anything on his head that could be construed as a helmet since 1987 they have not renewed the section of approved helmets because of that ruling our members of the legislature and the general public have to start speaking out
3851375 my understanding with insurance companies right now if you are involved in a motorcycle crash and are wearing one of those toy helmets they will null and void your insurance coverage for medical expenses and that includes icbc
3851376 do they realize a hospital stay can run between 1 000 and 10 000 a day if their insurance isnt going to cover their expenses
3851377 cigarettes have been determined they cost us too much with our health benefits and everything our insurance is increased because people smoke the government realizes that which is why theyve increased the tax and the cost of the things and passed legislation limiting purchase of the things i think its time the government both provincial and federal realize these helmets are starting to cost us in the same way
3851378 the motorcycle shop guy says here you want something cheap quick and legal here you go all theyre retailer doing is pushing an inferior product the bottom line for them is to sell products they dont care i can honestly say a lot of them dont care
3851379 due to unforeseen circumstances the catalytic cracking unit a key part of gasoline production at edmonton refinery had to be shut down last week
3851380 this has limited the supply of gasoline forcing petro canada to temporarily reduce the volume of gasoline delivered to customers and associates as a result customers in alberta and the interior of british columbia may notice outages of gasoline at some petro canada retail sites
3851381 we started out with a very comprehensive search from the air using the rcmp helicopter based out of kamloops
3851382 search teams combed the highways in kelowna lytton and lilloet areas
3851383 they had been in the stein valley for 18 days
3851384 they had been out of food for three days they werent properly equipped they didnt have a map the male was wearing hiking boots and jeans the female didnt have proper hiking boots either
3851385 they got about three quarters of the way and thats where the country gets a lot more rugged and very steep
3851386 it was at that point they decided to turn back so they had about three quarters of the journey to hike again they didnt meet any other hikers along the way that could help them out

3851388 rusland heeft het masker afgetrokken en opnieuw zijn ware gelaat getoond
3851389 heeft nagelaten om uitdrukkelijk de inbreuk van moskou aan te klagen op de internationale rechtsregels een natiestaat heeft onschendbare grenzen en de russische invasie heeft het grondgebied van een erkende natiestaat bezet
3851390 oorspronkelijk bedoelde men daarmee gemengde patrouilles met russen osseti rs en georgi rs nu zou dat alleen nog om russen gaan de gelijkheid is allesbehalve gewaarborgd
3851391 en ze gebruikte die als een middel om mensen te sensibiliseren
3851392 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3851393 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3851394 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react in a way russians are fighting a proxy war with the west through us
3851395 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3851396 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3851397 the border has been along this river for 1 000 years
3851398 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3851399 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbour country its not a good idea
3851400 the single most important thing is modified mandatory and enforceable reliability standards in the united states and we are working towards that in all of the provinces of canada
3851401 in ontario theres very little that has changed since the blackout because frankly we were already there
3851402 if we continue with our current centralized energy system were vulnerable to power mishaps
3851403 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer
3851404 i dont see there is anything wrong with it if everybody concerned agrees
3851405 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3851406 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3851407 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3851408 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3851409 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3851410 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3851411 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3851412 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3851413 the right information has to be given to the people
3851414 if we dont get the money by the end of the week we will start erecting barricades use stones stakes and manure to protest
3851415 a more serious offensive is still to come and they the government will eventually bear the responsibility for their negligence and inefficiency
3851416 at the moment i have no one to speak to in brussels they are all on holiday
3851417 i am not going on a spending spree i plan to bank most of it that is what i have got to live on for the rest of my life
3851418 naturally colin is relieved and it will go some way to compensating him for the vilification that he has received at the hands of the public and media for the least 16 years
3851419 in some peoples eyes he will always be the bloke who got away with murder
3851420 tomorrow were going to negotiate all day i cant predict the result but its clear that were closer to the demands of than we were a month ago
3851421 we are perhaps going to reap the reward of our efforts
3851422 the american side has considerably softened its stance over recent days
3851423 they are much readier to accept polands two cardinal conditions
3851424 today were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
3851425 the rising international tension which has caught us by surprise makes security guarantees even more important than ever
3851426 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
3851427 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want were not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
3851428 frankly i think thats disgusting honestly theyre seven and nine years old so young
3851429 i find it sad that they ruined an otherwise pretty awesome ceremony with those fakes
3851430 something about passing over a child for crooked teeth just seems well wrong
3851431 eager to put on a perfect olympics beijing has swept its streets of fake designer handbags pirated dvds and phoney corporate logos that dedication to authenticity apparently does not extend to olympics ceremonies
3851432 the song was pre recorded the artistic directors just picked the best voice and the best performer
3851433 im very happy to come back to the race of champions as its an event that i really enjoy
3851434 it will be very nice to compete against michael again like in 2004 we live very close to each other but rarely have a chance to meet
3851435 last time we actually met was on a track racing motorcycles michael was a little bit faster than me but i hope to get my revenge in identical cars at the race of champions
3851436 we could not be more excited to have stacey on our coaching staff
3851437 she brings a wealth of experience at every level of our game and will help us continue our rise up the rankings our players cant wait to get started but for now they will have to settle for watching her hopefully bring home the gold
3851438 i am thrilled with the opportunity to work at san diego state university
3851439 coach van wyk and her staff have done an incredible job with the program and i look forward to helping to continue that trend i feel privileged and honored to be an aztec

3851453 the police party was deployed in front of the police station and a suicide bomber approached them on foot and exploded himself resulting in seven deaths so far
3851454 it was an act to sabotage the independence day celebrations
3851455 i saw at least three policemen lying on the ground unconscious or dead
3851456 there were three to four other policemen standing nearby with their uniforms torn
3851457 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3851458 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home

3851517 results were significantly above our expectation in almost all aspects
3851518 the city has been buzzing about housing since the beginning of 2007 when prices suddenly began to jump and bidding wars became the norm instead of the exception home buyers however may be forgiven for wondering if not worrying about the recent turn in the market listings have jumped 46 per cent this year and sales are down 15 per cent
3851519 last years soaring market attracted a lot of speculation so people from b c alberta and even syndicates from new york were purchasing properties some people did a nice job in spending some money and increasing the value of properties said harry janzen executive officer of the saskatoon region association of realtors
3851520 but 2007 changed peoples expectations and 2008 is not fulfilling them our measures should be further out than just 2007 which was a very unique time in saskatchewan and certainly in saskatoon history said janzen
3851521 last year we had 10 buyers for each house says gary busch a real estate agent with century 21
3851522 its hard not to watch all these market reports said new homeowner janet french a starphoenix reporter who takes possession of her home in september
3851523 french and her fiance thought about buying a home last year but were so turned off by the bidding wars and fast rising prices they decided against it but in late may friends of theirs put a house on the market and eventually dropped the 260 000 asking price to 235 000
3851524 when i heard how much they were dropping the price i thought something is changing here she said
3851525 french hopes the market correction wont affect the value of her house which she purchased for 11 000 below the original asking price
3851526 sold to the highest bidder is a shout used to close deals for antiques and even picassos now new high end homes in billings will be sold next month under that same auctioneers cry
3851527 for what may be the first time since the 1980s as many as 15 custom built homes in the billings area will be sold at auction on sept 9 kenmark construction has teamed up with united country musser bros to sell the spec homes built before a buyer has been lined up ranging in price from 244 000 to 549 900
3851528 on tuesday mark kennedy one of the owners of kenmark construction opened the front door to a 4 827 square foot home at 4535 grams court in rehberg ranch to show off the granite countertops faux painted walls crown molding and the wood floors
3851529 while the occasional montana trophy ranch or home is sold at auction auctioneer mert musser said this sale is unique i would say it is the first time this has happened on this scale in billings and in montana musser said
3851530 marilyn floberg president of prudential floberg realtors said the auction approach is just one sign of changing business practices driven by the internet i look at it as an alternative marketing plan not totally out of the realm of possibility but not necessarily a sign of distress she said
3851531 treasure valley housing sales remained mired in a slump in july with total transactions off 39 percent from a year ago according to industry statistics mike pennington a residential specialist with john l scott said consumers are hoping prices will fall further
3851532 however with the federal reserve expected to begin raising interest rates to combat inflation waiting to buy may be a costly strategy he said
3851533 somebody has to say that its safe to go back in the water pennington said
3851534 adding to the industrys problems were inventory numbers that have risen 24 percent since the start of the year from 6 668 in january to 8 270 in july experts say the growing number of homes in foreclosure could be adding to the inventory problem
3851535 home prices also continued to slide the median price of a home sold in july was off 12 percent in ada and canyon counties from a year ago
3851536 another disheartening sign of market conditions is that even competitively priced homes have not been selling added associate broker shaun tracy
3851537 housing prices in cowlitz county rebounded for a second month in a row in july leading to speculation that the worst of the slump might be over locally however the number of home sales still is lagging well behind last years pace and theres still a big surplus of homes on the market
3851538 things are not looking dark around here gray perhaps but in the business here we feel like were seeing sunshine poking through said jerry flaskerud broker in longview
3851539 buyers still have the advantage over sellers but not by much flaskerud suggested
3851540 a house sold today would have sold for more a couple years ago but were not seeing as many distressed people and properties as they are seeing in clark county said sue lantz broker in longview
3851541 flaskerud said housing inventory continues to build locally because people reaching retirement age want to downsize and may want to sell but dont need to sell
3851542 two creeks was meant to bring luxury living to east clark county instead its upscale camas townhouses continue to bring financial ruin for its developers and to cost those who backed the project millions now 29 unsold homes out of 31 built near the camas meadows golf course in 2006 are heading to the auction block
3851543 the timing couldnt be worse home sales are down 41 percent and prices are down 3 to 5 percent from a year ago which will make it difficult to find buyers for the two creeks homes in time
3851544 it wasnt supposed to end this way when husband and wife rick bowler and marilee thompson unveiled plans for two creeks at camas meadows in 2004 the housing market was on the upswing and financing was available
3851545 they borrowed from columbia credit union and planned eventually to build 122 two story townhomes each with 2 200 to 3 000 square feet of living space and each equipped with elevators
3851546 they envisioned tennis courts a pool and jacuzzi barbecue stations charging stations for golf carts walking trails rv storage and more bowler said at the time
3851547 the first phase 31 townhouses went on the market in 2006 two people bought homes that year paying 750 000 and 825 000 since then no other sales have closed
3851548 when moda condominiums started accepting reservations in september 2006 prospective buyers lined up hours early and quickly locked up all 251 units
3851549 the market and the financing conditions for condominiums have really taken a drastic turn said developer g

3851551 several prominent area projects have switched from condos to apartments in recent months citing the slowing for sale market and relatively strong one for rentals
3851552 nearby agent paul lau said the lonely open house he was hosting sunday was consistent with his recent experience in southeast seattle youre lucky if you get five people he said
3851553 lenders cutting back on loans and tightening lending standards since last summer might have hit southeast seattle particularly hard because the area has a higher share of first time buyers who generally have smaller down payments and less established credit
3851554 a lot of the entry level buyers have just disappeared hamilton said
3851555 in columbia city seller gabriel newton had a steady stream of visitors flowing through his self hosted open house july 27 gary montgomery who was at the open house said he was looking in columbia city because he liked the neighborhoods feel older houses and prices
3851556 any other neighborhood where i like the home its 600 000 or 700 000 he said
3851557 montgomery rents in redmond and planned to hold off on buying until his girlfriend sold her house in portland but he got tired of waiting ill buy what i can a smaller home now while prices are low he said
3851558 record high prices on gas and food are causing people across the puget sound to pinch pennies
3851559 at the same time that people are paying more for food and gas wary employers have been reluctant to raise wages unemployment has risen too
3851560 at the family center in lynnwood director tim gahm has been busy working with his staff to broaden their services in the wake of rising prices for the past six to seven meetings what we have been discussing is the increasing needs of families surrounding basic needs he said
3851561 for some people the price jump is forcing them to make decisions they wouldnt normally consider take kerry breakfield of lynnwood for example the married mother of two drives a school bus part time a subsidy helps cover her 4 000 a month day care bill but its still not enough

3851565 this is a big loan for us but weve been mindful of the situation there for well over a year now and have acted prudently to set aside reserves

3851857 las definiciones de las necesidades de hacer o no este tipo de eventos son decisiones propias de la gesti n del gobierno ah no podemos ingresar tenemos limitaciones lo que s podemos hacer eventualmente es que el oci rgano de control institucional de palacio de gobierno haga una evaluaci n de los gastos que se han hecho eso se realiza siempre en todas las actividades que hay en el gobierno

3851866 he has two options to stay and fight or quit and go home
3851867 if he fights back we are with him we will support him and that is the preferred option
3851868 using that power would be undemocratic under the present circumstances even though it is in the constitution the democratic process should continue

3851871 in the baltic states and ukraine independence is still seen as something fragile and not necessarily built to last
3851872 people are certainly afraid that russia could attack lithuania just like georgia
3851873 we came to fight since our old neighbour thinks that it can fight us
3851874 this country thinks that old times will come back but that time is over everyone knows that the next one could be ukraine then poland

3851876 war is war the russian government continued to accuse president mikhail saakashvili of unleashing genocide and killing 2 000 civilians but it promised to punish any troops found looting

3851883 its a format thats always fascinated me introduced by compuserve in 1987 it has the distinction of being the very first color compression format widely used for images online
3851884 is that a single file can contain multiple images shown in a timed sequence giving the effect of motion known fondly as an animated gif
3851885 in the age of hi def video on the web the overall effect of animated gifs is lo fi and with its limited color palette what it does to photos is kind of egregious which i think is great some of the people i invited have made ingenious use of this format and i wanted to see what more can be done with this almost antiquated format today plus were showing the work on a 44 inch hi res monitor which takes gif format out of its native environment to an interesting effect

3851895 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3851896 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3851897 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on war fighting in the cyber domain
3851898 the referee did me a favour by stopping it but one more big punch and it was over anyway no one does that to him he has never been put on the floor but my right hand has come along so much
3851899 he committed with the right hand and i felt a real crunch when i connected i could feel it bone on bone when i landed on his chin and his weight coming forward helped the punch and second time a big right hook around the back of the head put him down and he was gone
3851900 i can relax a bit more the first one is out of the way
3851901 it was going to be my hardest one on paper but i have just got to take one fight at a time and i know if i beat the lithuanian ive got a medal
3851902 ive beaten the world no 1 but styles make fights and that style suits me but the next ones a different style of fighter and well watch the video and work on it i owe him one from when i was a kid he beat me then when i was a bit mentally weak and i turned the corner after that
3851903 the concept of torture could also be altered by products in this market it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
3851904 experiments indicate that the advantages of these devices are such that human operators will be greatly enhanced for things like photo reconnaissance and so on
3851905 in the intelligence community there is an extremely small number of people who understand the science and without that its going to be impossible to predict surprises this is a black hole that needs to be filled with light
3851906 were not going to be reading minds at a distance but that doesnt mean we cant detect gross changes in anxiety or fear and then subsequently talk to those individuals to see whats upsetting them
3851907 its overwhelming to come back to school when youve been a stay at home mom weve done several devotions about being a wife mother and then the teacher its a new balancing act
3851908 i loved being a stay at home mom but i had to get back to teaching because i missed it
3851909 ninety percent of the teachers i know have an opportunity to stay home because their husbands are able to let them stay home
3851910 i missed them and am used to being with them
3851911 what has been good for me is to realize that being a stay at home mom with young children was great but that season is over for me
3851912 i felt like it was possible to come back and i was ready to come back
3851913 i got to substitute for two years and fill in as an aide
3851914 they all said they missed teaching and thats the kind of teachers i want around our children
3851915 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over

3851927 some participants even make a commitment to pursue christianity further
3851928 one problem that we non believers often encounter is that we seem to take a negative stance on many things no prayers in legislatures no oaths in courts of law no invocations the list goes on
3851929 this material may be offensive to some of our citizens it deals with the subject of in a way that some may find offensive this is not a semi public ban but a way for all citizens to have some ability to filter out some things that are public we are a diverse people after all
3851930 decline of social morals which has already jeopardized the system of social trust

3851932 this is very bare bones and very reminiscent of a political prisoner camp or a concentration camp
3851933 w hen the president does it that means that it is not illegal
3851934 when the justice department refuses to press charges that means that it makes no difference that its illegal

3851953 i am absolutely shocked and deeply saddened today the world has lost not just an outstanding basketball coach but a great person and great friend i was fortunate to be friends with him even before i came back to carolina over these last four seasons there have been several occasions on which he was the first coach to call and offer his heartfelt congratulations ill always remember him calling after the 2006 season to say what a great job we had done after losing all the players from the championship team that call meant so much to have come from another coach this april i heard from a hundred or so coaches after the hall of fame announcement and skip was the first to call but skip was someone who will be measured in terms of his actions not just words our thoughts and prayers go out to his family the world has lost a great person and great family man

3851966 but we wanted it to have some beautiful simplicity and we wanted to feature the horseshoe the symbol of the horseshoe is so universal so powerful
3851967 is more like a class ring all were made by herff jones a local jeweler
3851968 i think today is the first day it really hits now it hits home and tomorrow is a new day so its time to get another one
3851969 once you do it it just makes you a lot more hungry to do it again
3851970 its just amazing its a dream come true you never expect it to be like this the whole presentation the ceremony how they brought it in was just amazing im blessed were all blessed its a moment you all dream about the moment finally got here i always thought about how it would feel once it happened it just makes you want to do it again and again and again
3851971 ive been dreaming about this since i was seven years old
3851972 weve got to keep it going and figure out a way to get it done next year
3851973 it was great we knew we were going to get the rings the big thing was everyone came in with the smiles and loving that we were here together it just goes to show this team is together the camaraderie has been here forever to get the ring just solidifies the whole thing
3851974 you see from the video all we had to go through during the season the perseverance all of it culminated by the rings it was a beautiful event man a great feeling i guess im still a little bit shocked i feel really blessed to be fortunate enough to be on this team with this great leadership all weve been through the last couple of seasons knocking on the door knocking on the door finally opening the door and seeing whats on the other side its a beautiful feeling
3851975 it was nice to win and somebody said wait until you get the ring they were right it really sets in
3851976 you kind figured mr colts owner jim irsay was going to do it up real nice which he did i dont think anyone was let down
3851977 a great night we had a great time seeing guys everybody enjoyed it and the event was first class all around all the pictures it was a great way to finish up the season
3851978 youve worked for it you see it on your finger and it represents how hard all your teammates have worked to get to one destination and you finally made it its a pretty great feeling
3851979 it only gives you about a month and a half to wear it because then next season starts
3851980 i think you really cant wear it after that or youre just sort of hanging onto last season
3851981 the ring is what its all about there was a lot of emotion in the room tonight as there should be i couldnt be happier it was a special evening for the whole colts family it was special
3851982 you realize in life as you get older some of the things that help you grow are the more difficult things also the difficult things you have to deal with with the bitter losses sometimes make the victory that much sweeter its really a culmination of all that it really feels great to the steward of the joy so to speak thats my most enjoyable aspect to see all this joy to see dreams come true
3851983 i think about those who arent here also i think about my dad everyone thinks about people who didnt quite make it in their bodies to this day but we know theyre with us obviously thats something where its very retrospective in your mind you take it all in and you start getting ready to defend and get ready to do it again
3851984 just being here together all of us just reminds me how great this group is the memories of the season and the accomplishment seeing the guys get their rewards im so proud to work with colts owner and chief executive officer jim irsay im so proud to be these guys coach i dont know what to say
3851985 you start every year trying to get there you know how difficult it is when you achieve it youre just so proud of the guys getting done what everyone wants to accomplish

3852152 all south africans must rally their efforts behind the 2010 project in their various areas of expertise to ensure that come 2010 we deliver the best world cup ever
3852153 this is just one of the signs that we are ready to welcome the world
3852154 construction is on schedule and our deadlines remain all ten stadiums required for hosting the 2010 fifa world cup will be ready for the final inspection date which is december 2009 while the confederations cup matches four venues will be completed by mid december 2008
3852155 we have started with our training exercises to test our abilities during the 2010 fifa world cup
3852156 we have a list of internationally wanted criminals and we do have measures in place on how we will deal and address the issues during the world cup
3852157 but i never saw anyone else like family or kids

3852160 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3852161 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3852162 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out

3852166 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3852167 autism may frighten people because so little is known about the disorder
3852168 the cause has not been scientifically proven and the victims often act in ways society doesnt understand

3852171 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3852172 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3852173 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3852174 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3852175 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them

3852426 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
3852427 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
3852428 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
3852429 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
3852430 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
3852431 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
3852432 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
3852433 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
3852434 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
3852435 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
3852436 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
3852437 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
3852438 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
3852439 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
3852440 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
3852441 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
3852442 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
3852443 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
3852444 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
3852445 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
3852446 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
3852447 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
3852448 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
3852449 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
3852450 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
3852451 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
3852452 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
3852453 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
3852454 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
3852455 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
3852456 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
3852457 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
3852458 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
3852459 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3852460 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
3852461 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
3852462 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
3852463 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
3852464 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
3852465 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
3852466 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
3852467 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
3852468 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
3852469 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
3852470 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
3852471 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
3852472 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
3852473 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
3852474 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
3852475 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
3852476 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
3852477 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
3852478 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
3852479 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
3852480 who are open to doing something on the production side
3852481 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
3852482 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
3852483 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
3852484 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
3852485 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
3852486 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
3852487 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
3852488 i miraculously walked away without being arrested and immediately began making phone calls to get help for these great pro life warriors
3852489 two troopers responding to the calls asked the protesters to disperse after they could not produce a permit to demonstrate an hour later 20 members of the same group marched again at the intersection they were charged with disorderly conduct failure to obey a lawful order and willfully obstructing the flow of traffic

3852494 this infidel priest is not funny and is ill informed
3852495 he is a right wing bigot who is anti choice and anti woman the goddess is not happy with his blog
3852496 he is the poorest priest i know always pontificating about things he knows nothing about he is a disgrace
3852497 the invasion is going as planned and soon all the clergy will be pod people from outer space starting with father joe

3852499 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
3852500 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
3852501 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
3852502 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
3852503 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
3852504 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
3852505 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
3852506 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
3852507 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
3852508 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
3852509 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
3852510 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
3852511 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
3852512 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
3852513 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
3852514 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
3852515 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
3852516 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
3852517 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
3852518 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
3852519 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
3852520 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
3852521 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees

3852549 this bill represents the most significant improvements to product safety since congress created the cpsc in the 1970s
3852550 congress responded to the wishes of parents and children all across america and passed legislation that will help restore our confidence in the safety of our toys and everyday products

3852569 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3852570 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3852571 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3852572 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3852573 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation

3852636 it was just political everybody closes up before the olympic games i was just shut out of their system suddenly and unexpectedly and it was highly irritating

3853108 i think sir alex realises we werent too far away from united when they were at the very top of their game
3853109 i dont think united have another level to go to they had a lot of players in their team who have been at the peak of their form for the last two years rio ferdinand has been awesome for the last two years and cristiano ronaldo was unbelievable i dont think youll see that again wayne rooney carlos tevez ryan giggs they have all been fantastic
3853110 with the injuries weve had as players we can all raise the bar a little bit
3853111 with it being that close in the premier league and champions league they know well give them a big run for their money i think we can close the gap because man united were at the very top of their game last season im taking nothing away from them because theyve been unbelievable over the past two years but weve been very close to them and we had injuries and a change of manager
3853112 i need probably one more week before im back in full training im nearly there
3853113 im looking forward to the season because last season i missed six months i want to play more than last season and show my ability on the pitch then maybe i will get more chances in the team

3853133 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well
3853134 weve had a few false starts and ive had to run a couple of laps no big deal
3853135 no one wants to see that you want it to run like it should and i think for the most part weve done that now they havent thrown everything at me but i could go into a game and i think i could manage a game ok
3853136 and now i foam to wheat a glitter of seas the childs cry melts in the wall and i am the arrow the dew that flies suicidal at one with the drive into the red eye the cauldron of morning
3853137 both of us went naked the white and blue pareo around the loins hatchet in hand my guide seemed to follow the trail by smell rather than by sight for the ground was covered by a splendid confusion of plants leaves and flowers
3853138 the silence was absolute but for the plaintive wailing of the water among the rocks
3853139 and in this forest this solitude the silence were we two he a very young man and i almost an old man from whose soul many illusions had fallen and whose body was tired from countless efforts upon whom lay the long and fatal heritage of the vices of a morally and physically corrupt society
3853140 with the suppleness of an animal and the graceful litheness of an androgyne he walked a few paces in advance of me and it seemed that i saw incarnated in him palpitating and living all the magnificent plant life which surrounded us from him through him there became disengaged and emanated a powerful perfume of beauty
3853141 once id been tied up by this man who shaved my balls then put alcohol on them so that they burned slightly
3853142 i became atman and brahma the universal breath that belongs to god i became the thing that the egyptians called the first light that glimpse of dawn that distills creation
3853143 the water doesnt really know what age you are so it doesnt really matter when you hit the water what age you are

3853145 entomology is basically about sex drugs rock n roll and excrement

3853148 theyre not moving at a fast speed but they are moving towards tbilisi
3853149 clearly more americans chose to stay close to home in june than in previous years
3853150 is not surprising given the environment that we were in
3853151 i think people have started to take the increase in gas prices somewhat more in stride
3853152 more americans age 50 plus are trying to leave their cars behind but face obstacles as soon as they walk out the door climb on their bikes or head for the bus
3853153 we cant afford to continue pinning our transportation networks future to the gas tax
3853154 advances in higher fuel efficiency vehicles and alternative fuels are making the gas tax an even less sustainable support for funding roads bridges and transit systems

3853159 do you think anyone will ever call me a slut

3853161 among other things yes listen i hope it never happens to you but people men particularly particularly a certain kind of man who doesnt have much power in the world likes to harass women especially women who seem powerless thats why this kind of guy goes after young women from the time i was about thirteen until i was twenty nine or thirty guys like that were always yelling at me from cars or saying things to me on the street or coming up to me in malls or in stores and saying things
3853162 i was young and i was a woman i looked like something they could dominate thats all it was they want someone they can be more powerful than its nothing but patriarchy in action so what do you do if someone like that ever harasses you
3853163 chinas leaders know that the development of green buildings is a critical need and the olympic village can serve as a model for this

3853186 we dont know how many contractors were working on anthrax projects for the cia we dont know how many projects

3853194 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home

3853292 not every fighting is warfare while georgia is obviously under a ddos attack and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3853293 coulda shoulda the nature of whats going on isnt clear but until we are certain anything state sponsored is happening on the internet it is my official opinion this is not warfare but just some unaffiliated attacks by russian hackers and or some rioting by enthusiastic russian supporters
3853294 what matters is that the internet is being used as a tool in warfare
3853295 lets not put a diminutive feel on these cyberattacks a ddos attack is still a serious event and according to some of the statistics provided very few web sites would have been able to withstand these onslaughts
3853296 these days it doesnt take a tank to participate in a war but only home broadband and a computer the internet can bring a war right into your own home in more than one way
3853297 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the rbn and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3853298 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known hosting services
3853299 we are stunned and shaken by todays shooting at the arkansas democratic party where our good friend and fellow democrat bill gwatney was critically wounded bill is not only a strong chairman of arkansas democratic party but he is also a cherished friend and confidante our thoughts and prayers are with bill and his family today and we wish him a quick recovery

3853315 mining companies should be valued on their long term fundamentals xstrata has admitted that it has long coveted lonmins long life high quality low cost assets
3853316 this opportunistic proposal is an attempt to acquire lonmins assets cheaply and capitalise on the expected improvement in our mining and processing performance
3853317 this pre conditional offer fails to recognise our growth potential given both the ounces we have in the ground and the long term demand for pgms in the future
3853318 it is not in the interests of our shareholders and the board will continue to oppose it vigorously

3853335 weve been clear about the current threat for the last six months the threat is high in certain parts of northern ireland
3853336 but theyre badly disrupted theyre marginalised theyre fighting with each other so they are not at the same level and they dont have the capacity in our judgement to carry out an outrage on the scale of omagh
3853337 but they still pose a threat to the public and to the police
3853338 their focus is clear they are determined to kill a police officer they are focused on killing a police officer and that is where our efforts are going

3853412 thats a good sign in terms of developing a therapeutic vaccine
3853413 elite suppression offers clues to vaccine researchers on many fronts how cd8 killer t cells can attack hiv and how a stronger immune response can force hiv into a permanent defensive state
3853414 many start up companies are boot strapped relying on personal savings bank card debt and other personal resources including sweat equity doing for themselves by the sweat of their brow what they might pay others to do if there were better first sources of outside investment capital

3853428 it will save half our grain and will also reduce villagers dependence on food stock
3853429 the only issue is how people react to rat meat but i think it will not be a problem
3853430 some socially deprived people in bihar have always consumed rat meat if they can eat rats why cant the rest of the people
3853431 rat meat will make up nutrition deficiencies among villagers since rats are a major source of protein
3853432 i think you should look at the relationship as one of constructive engagement where you can find common areas like north korea and iran but also be in a position where they can respect you enough to listen to your views on religious freedom and political liberty
3853433 if you are a religious person you understand that once religion takes hold in a society it cant be stopped
3853434 i went to church here and im sure the cynics say well you know it was just a state sponsored church on the other hand and thats true it gave me a chance to say to the chinese people religion wont hurt you you ought to welcome religious people and it gave me a chance to say to the chinese government why dont you register the underground churches and give them a chance to flourish and he listened politely i cant read his mind but i do know that every time i met with him i pressed the point
3853435 i have a keepsake mold of caitlins hand that was made just before she died and its the one thing that i can look at and touch
3853436 besides pictures thats all i have left of her and it means a lot to me
3853437 i didnt know what i was doing the first time
3853438 there were around 100 people and i just opened up my house in glen ellyn and it was combination raffle and auction and we made 7 000
3853439 and he spends about six months a year on this project writing letters to people with ties to famous people to help out
3853440 we tell people they can bring friends if they want
3853441 i think it touches a lot of people because its for sick kids
3853442 and people love matt and know what hes been through and want to support him because they know this is important to matt
3853443 a lot of parents give back to the hospitals that took care of their children but matts been amazing
3853444 just the stamina that hes had year after year and the proceeds from the event increasing exponentially thats whats unbelievable
3853445 literally last year we were in a tight financial situation until we got matts 14 000 donation which was enough to keep us going where we could line up more funding
3853446 when you look at our budget which is in the low 50 000s the donation is a big chunk of our budget and unlike grants matt allows us to use the money for more than just the handholds
3853447 if done well it gives a very real replica of the childs hand that captures the lines and prints
3853448 she was kind of always up for anything when they asked if she wanted to go to opening day at the cubs game she was ready for it she was just full of life no matter what she was going through
3853449 they ask if you want a keepsake and we just said yes im so glad we did
3853450 its just like having a little piece of the person with them thats tangible that they can look at and feel
3853451 with children there are often so little memories because of how short their lives are and to have that actual concrete piece of that person is very meaningful to many parents
3853452 i know what it is for me and it may not be the same for someone else but i just want others to have this available to them
3853453 i know what happened to caitlin is not hereditary but in the back of my mind its there
3853454 i dont want to be a carrier for something that promotes this wicked disease its just always been a fear
3853455 have not woken up to the realities of the world
3853456 the decrease in the second quarter of 2008 shows that the vc investment spend has been hindered by the macro events in the economy
3853457 despite the decline the number of deals for the second quarter of 2008 rose to 80 representing a 21 increase in the number of deals over the last quarter

3853474 new evidence confirms the nutritional superiority of plant based organic foods
3853475 the american council for science and health acsh report by dr joseph rosen seems to accept and does not argue with the factors we identified to screen published nutrient content studies for scientific validity
3853476 but as he goes through the various sections of our report he criticizes us for cherry picking results excluding matched pairs wherethe results favor conventional food that is not what we did he misrepresents our methodology and offers inconsistent and illogical suggestions to correct what he perceives as bias in our selection of the matched pairs of foods that were then used to compare nutrient concentrations
3853477 we applied the screening method and selection criteria consistently and in fact eliminated more results favoring the organic food in a matched pair than the conventional food without our screening methods and criteria the nutritional advantage of organic food would have been greater
3853478 us organics company using tracing system to allay safety concerns
3853479 pushing biotech as the solution to the worlds problems is doing more harm than good
3853480 biotech is now the solution to feeding developing nations renewable supply of energy reducing the carbon footprint and global warming although biotechnologies cancertainly help solve these problems ramming that message down peoples throatsis hardly likely to convince the doubters
3853481 take a recent case in point the biotechnology industryorganizations bio slogan for its annual meeting in san diego in june was heal fuel feed the world

3853490 you could be the king of england and it doesnt matter
3853491 when i started in wine about 10 years ago spain was the up and coming wine region and its still the up and coming wine region
3853492 in that period of time south africa up and came other regions up and came spain just seems to be still climbing
3853493 but its a hard wine because if its not fresh which most of it that gets here isnt its really different
3853494 when you drink it straight from the barrel or after its been in the bottle for one month your mind explodes amazing amazing flavors
3853495 education of the retailers would be good most retailers just know they need to have a few bottles on hand for the crazy old person but its a real eye opener when you have a fresh one
3853496 i had no idea where minnesota was even located on a map
3853497 to survive here one truly has to come to terms with the fact that nothing will happen quickly efficiently or politely within government or corporate circles
3853498 but i adore the people they are gregarious boisterous and opinionated willing to entertain with music food or dance at a moments notice i adore the rich history that surrounds us the lush natural surroundings the rich cultural diversity the fresh produce meats and fish and of course the wine
3853499 when we started i thought i needed to do points
3853500 and then i would have 10 wines rated 87 and i like each one for a different reason they scored the same but they had nothing in common at this point if someone asks about a wine ill tell you what i think ill give it a thumbs up but i wont do points
3853501 and i think the tasting note should die you know how many wines have lemony notes every single white plus they tend to make people intimidated
3853502 if im talking about wine and food im probably about 70 to 80 percent fluent
3853503 pathetic on a bad day and decent on a good day we are functional

3853523 i just love this man on my nz journey i met him twice performing this song on queen st cnr wellesly rd as kind of an extended instrumental version that would last for hours and hours it was a sunny day and i couldnt help but sing and hum along with the overtones every time the deep bass hit me it sent me shivers of joy down my spine and simply hypnotized me back then in fact i never thought to be able to hear this song ever again so thanks a million times for posting mate

3853530 im writing every day right here at the piano in this living room

3853533 this is one reason the source code of arc itself is so short incidentally i did the same thing to it but my first priority was making applications shorter not the language there are features most notably prolog style pattern matching that seem to promise great savings in length but turn out only to be useful for writing a few basic sequence operations like append remove and so on prolog is a great language for writing append after that its all downhill
3853534 the art of writing is the art of discovering what you believe
3853535 die dreifaltigkeit f r die einf ltigen luthers catechetical doctrine of the trinity
3853536 in general the doctrine of the trinity came to a standstill in his theology like an erratic boulder
3853537 luther is not a man for the mystery of the trinity
3853538 his luthers trinitarian doctrine remained largely a simple devout expression of his belief in the traditional dogma
3853539 in luthers own writings the trinity plays only a very minor theological role serving largely to buttress his real concerns which are those of faith and justification
3853540 the belarusian and russian people are grieving over the victims of the tragedy sharing the sorrow of the people who lost their dear ones were left without a roof over their heads and means of living we wish them fortitude and courage in surmounting the consequences of this humanitarian catastrophe
3853541 as for the statements that came from tbilisi on the intention of georgias administration to withdraw from the commonwealth these statements are certainly regretful today we can speak of nothing more than statements for as yet there has been no official notification from georgia that would state its intention to resign of its cis membership
3853542 i would like tbilisi to recognise the destructiveness of such plans
3853543 establishing ceasefire and returning to negotiations for the sake of finding peaceful solutions to the conflict was the most important thing in the situation this is why the cis executive committee was satisfied with the agreements reached on august 12 to cease military actions provide access to humanitarian aid and withhold from using force
3853544 amendments and addenda to belarus president decree no 9 of december 20 2007 and decree no 1 of january 28 2008
3853545 if we do not finish 80 of the harvest by the end of the week it will become quite a challenging task later
3853546 what is being done in the regions to streamline the harvesting campaign is everything organized carefully and efficiently is there any unjustified downtime of machinery
3853547 the activities of the presidents aids the main inspectors in the regions also require much attention unfortunately they have recently been working very passively
3853548 we are somewhat perplexed by the modest silence of the belarussian side you need to express yourself more clearly on such issues especially as we have a union state
3853549 the reason things will stay the same is that the cis is merely a nostalgic organization that was established to make it possible for newly independent countries to have a civilized divorce after the breakup of the ussr
3853550 even the heads of state acknowledge this the cis has long been something like a presidents club collapse is an inappropriate term to use regarding the cis as there is actually nothing that could collapse the presidents will continue having meetings and it isnt important how those meetings are called
3853551 there will be no breakup of the cis and any significant changes in its existence after all this decision should have been expected as georgia had repeatedly declared its intention to quit the cis
3853552 since recently saakashvili has used the cis merely as a forum for bilateral meetings with presidents and solving georgias domestic problems
3853553 georgia hasnt been active in the framework of the commonwealth moreover we remember that the georgian parliament has repeatedly raised this issue withdrawal from the cis thats why saakashvilis decision was only to be expected after the last developments conflict over south ossetia
3853554 in this situation belarus wont take any steps that might raise any eyebrows
3853555 i believe that well accept the decisions that will be made by the european union and russia
3853556 the current situation in georgia is comparable to the soviet unions intention to occupy finland or the czech republic
3853557 in my opinion this is banditry and one should run away from bandits at least from the legal point of view georgias move to pull out of the cis was an entirely logical and predictable step but i wouldnt like other cis member countries to follow suit
3853558 belarus legislation on the use of atomic energy does not have limitations regarding the rights of ownership of the plant we will consider offers of all potential partners
3853559 we understand that this current georgian leadership is a special project of the united states but one day the united states will have to choose between defending its prestige over a virtual project or real partnership which requires joint action
3853560 frankly speaking once again i was surprised by the skills of the speechwriters who prepared the statement of the u s president
3853561 bushs speech said nothing of how georgia was armed all these years including by the united states
3853562 we have more than once warned our partners that this is a dangerous game
3853563 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3853564 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3853565 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3853566 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and has agreed to a provisional cease fire
3853567 unfortunately weve been receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3853568 as i speak the russian tanks are attacking the town of gori and are rampaging through the town
3853569 i can tell you with all responsibility that there are no and cannot be any russian tanks in gori
3853570 the world seems to talk about cease fires while the worst kind of atrocities are being commited in my country
3853571 let the world finally wake up and take action and provide real security for the region
3853572 if the principle of territorial integrity is violated europe will face chaos
3853573 it is clear that georgia has no right to solve the conflicts in its territory sovereignty is only on paper and the international community is not active enough if we want peace to be established here occupation troops should leave georgia
3853574 if the principle ensured long term stability in europe is violated europe will face chaos
3853575 i call our biggest ally responder for global security the us to ensure security of georgia strict measures have been demanded on the situation occurred in georgia
3853576 security of small nations and countries should be ensured by nato eu and the us if we win aggression against georgia we will see restoration of situation existed till 1991
3853577 there have been hundreds of cases of hate crime against poles in this country recorded in the last 2 years some leading to death or permanent injury and we would not want these incidents to be encouraged by potentially inflammatory newspaper stories or headlines
3853578 the doctor told us that someone had sex with patryk
3853579 she advised us to say nothing about the incident because then people will single him out as the boy who was raped at the end she ordered an hiv test for him
3853580 doctors talk to the younger patients on a daily basis and he patryk at no point told us in words that something like that had happened
3853581 at the point in time when the rape was supposed to have taken place there were 16 patients on the ward and none of them were bathing without the help of a member of hospital staff the doctor and psychiatrist in charge were told by other patients that the 13 year old may have touched the intimate parts of the 8 year old boy
3853582 we had a little trouble in the first half and thats when we lost the game we didnt score the easy baskets when we had the chance
3853583 ive quite gotten used to the weather here during the pre games training
3853584 that is quite long way from here but i might appear there
3853585 she isnt very much interested in rowing instead she loves volleyball
3853586 we have to make sure were going about this the right way that people are using the technology appropriately and with full consent

3853592 the rule also says that if the court has modified or reversed a lower courts judgment and ordered the lower court to award a judgment for money the court would provide instructions with respect to the allowance of interest
3853593 the united states is now expected to raise its interest rates much sooner than in europe
3853594 investors are pricing in those expectations to the dollar and euro
3853595 investors still arent comfortable with the georgian war with russia
3853596 theyre taking their money out of europe and putting it into the united states where they feel its safe
3853597 this just means that the pound has become very weak the dollar is not necessarily that strong
3853598 bank earnings were worrisome and third quarter earnings are expected to be worse
3853599 in particular i am very impressed by his early involvement in addressing the abuse of prescription drugs
3853600 charlie chivers your friendly mi 6 agent how may we be of personal service
3853601 the persons case of 1929 is important because it marks the moment when canadians could no longer exclude women from universities professions or politics
3853602 it is amazing to see how far we have come and learn about what women before us had to go through
3853603 kendra got a kitchen knife and cut me on my arm
3853604 w e had a two hour wait until we actually marched in at this point athletes started mingling and i met usa mens basketball players carmelo anthony lebron james kobe bryant and jason kidd i got my picture with all of them they were all very nice and asked me about running track one of them actually ended up asking for my number and chatting me up for a while and got out his camera to take a picture with me but thats a story for another time
3853605 dont tell me to be quiet cuz ill get my grandmas gun and come shoot you
3853606 but the apple does not fall far from the tree
3853607 but its just one grade that youre not going to like
3853608 what a pity i havent got mike to run to now
3853609 its very good for georgia to win and its very good for the russians to go home
3853610 there were no politics in this game today because we werent playing a match against georgia because those girls arent georgians they are brazilians
3853611 yes we felt for the people in our country but it is not anything political
3853612 i have a georgian passport and a brazilian passport and we fought the last two years to be here it was very hard and there was a lot of pressure so i am very proud today not only because it was against russia but because we played hard out there and we won this match and were still in the competition
3853613 its very good for georgia to win and advance to the next round
3853614 im tremendously disappointed weve been here nearly five years we have lots of friends and family
3853615 but life goes on and well make the most of it wherever we go
3853616 iraq was an unjust war based on false pretences and every soldier who refused to fight probably saved a lot of lives
3853617 failing that we have been here for him and we will be here for him
3853618 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3853619 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3853620 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3853621 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3853622 was russias objective a in georgia the overthrow of the democratically elected government of that country
3853623 i have given a complete response and perhaps the had not been listening when he had given his response perhaps he had not had his earpiece on
3853624 russian media reported that foreign fighters including americans were found among the dead in tskhinvali americans who were probably either mercenaries or instructors in the georgian armed forces
3853625 we hear a lot of propaganda weve heard the u s gave the green light to this operation i have nothing specific with regards to these reports but i would not conclude that they are true we did not have any prior knowledge or were not consulted by georgia
3853626 with the eruption of fighting between russia and georgia israel has found itself in an awkward position as a result of its arms sales to georgia caught between its friendly relations with
3853627 i was waiting for that one to come up last year in edmonton i got flack about it so if someone is willing to bring an ottawa senators head cover ill put it on my bag for the week i guess you can put that out in the media
3853628 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3853629 since i was 17 years old i have been performing on the opry circuit in texas
3853630 to be acknowledged by the grand ole opry and asked to perform is such an honor
3853631 this is more than i could have ever hoped for
3853632 its really scary because this has never happened where we live this is the first time this has ever happened and now were scared to go out or anything and its really strange
3853633 a lot of surfers never hardly see any gangsters or any activity like that around here
3853634 the airline industry is facing the toughest challenge since 9 11 with fuel prices that have nearly doubled in the past year and ten airlines that have shut down in the u s since january alone thats why were here today
3853635 right now theyre rapidly changing prices charging for pillows coffee and everything that you do but the basic problem is the price of fuel
3853636 each ton of fuel makes over three tons of carbon
3853637 we estimated the impact of this new cost for the airlines at 5 billion euros per year an average of the first nine years
3853638 unfortunately airline companies are still going to have to use fuel
3853639 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3853640 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3853641 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3853642 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3853643 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3853644 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work
3853645 most of our attempts with the moray eel have also been unsuccessful

3853656 has anyone ever told you youre like martha stewart on steroids or crack
3853657 i only came to paris with the intention of showing what i thought was strong and beautiful it just so happened that my notion was different from everybody elses
3853658 i still dont think if you said to mccain flat out do you approve of that kind of message that he would necessarily agree with it or support it
3853659 i really think its realistic i give it a 50 50 chance
3853660 i would love to be the class of olympic athletes to sweep but everything has to go right
3853661 if we dont go out there and hit the marks that were supposed to hit then we dont dominate because there are a lot of quality european athletes
3853662 i mean enoughs enough its not his fault were just getting him checked out for precautionary measures
3853663 what is the definition of a fiance if im your fiance
3853664 the powerful and provocative story of a stable boy and a psychiatrist who seek to understand the sexual and religious mystery which leads to a climatic and unbelievable event
3853665 wanneer hebben we pauze hebben we wel tegelijk pauze hoe lang hebben we pauze
3853666 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3853667 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3853668 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3853669 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3853670 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3853671 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3853672 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3853673 extensive scientific studies will be done on the body by a team of scientists including a molecular biologist an anthropologist a paleontologist and other scientists over the next few months at an undisclosed location
3853674 i feel in all honesty this indeed may be the real deal and i say this carefully after reviewing information that has been shared privately with me

3853681 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade
3853682 i have two kids im worried about so i have other priorities
3853683 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3853684 as president will fight to maintain the strong protections of the

3853686 edwards said the rite was called a wedding and integrated the couples buddhist and christian traditions
3853687 the bible talks about the fruits of the holy spirit love joy peace patience kindness goodness gentleness and self control
3853688 these are the qualities all humans should aspire to be known by it is clear to me that nancy and brendas marriage embody these virtues nancy and brenda demonstrated a strong commitment to each other and to god sic i saw no reason not to publicly recognize their commitment because they happen to be two women

3853692 we continue to be very pleased with the reaction from customers we see in the market
3853693 while customers are saying they never like to pay more money they see the additional value
3853694 supposedly were going to get more value i havent seen it because i havent been shown it
3853695 we need to look at a longer term of what that level of maintenance is and ask quite honestly are we getting business value
3853696 cannot support the compulsory replacement of standard support with enterprise support at this point in time
3853697 our impression is and the feedback we got from our members is that the opposition is very significant
3853698 the feedback especially from the small to medium businesses is that they have very simple landscapes and are familiar with their systems they dont see at the moment why they should need enterprise support
3853699 of what works and what needs correction thus leverage our considerable member base to influence sap to either change the costs or change the offerings as appropriate
3853700 it really requires a mature organization to understand whats going to be needed to assess and execute a life cycle management strategy
3853701 it can make really intelligent decisions around what they should get rid of and they might even find they have more money in the budget and they can start taking a look at newer technology and see if they can bring it in house without that big picture they just end up spending more and more money than had they been proactive
3853702 its also beneficial for those moments that are just completely out of your control like mergers acquisitions and uncontrolled corporate growth either organic or inorganic
3853703 it leaders without this tool set are now charged with pulling all this information together on short notice that could be diminished considerably in terms of turnaround time and effort for it guys if they have a holistic asset management program in place
3853704 in the end a real holistic way takes into account the procurement side ordering and whos actually doing the ordering vendor management standardizing on the vendors
3853705 once these things are in the door thats when the real costs start to pile up for assets because its about running them configuration and control maintenance and tracking licenses integration with security standardized images whats on the machine whats running that kind of stuff will allow you from an it perspective to become process efficient and lower your costs
3853706 the average general sales tax in the u s today is around six percent but the average state and local taxes and fees on cell phone service comes in at about 17 percent
3853707 consumers are left paying a hefty portion of their monthly cell phone bill to the government for what many believe is their most important communications device
3853708 the wireless industry has never been a utility and shouldnt be treated that way
3853709 imposing any new discriminatory tax on mobile services cell phones mobile services providers or mobile services property for three years
3853710 how come i end up where i started how come i end up where i went wrong
3853711 the meeting was set up in order to share information back and forth between us it was not set up as a meeting to come to any final decision
3853712 we certainly implied to wiseman and he agreed that this had to be a high level meeting
3853713 we have to have people present who have the authority to make some very definite decisions
3853714 i dont know if they were actually planning to move people
3853715 i think it was more to keep the general public from becoming upset at the fact that this could actually happen
3853716 they have to have a plan in place and the physicians have had offers
3853717 often widely attended public events are a riders way into the system
3853718 they get on it for the first time and say hey this is kind of neat i wouldnt mind doing this every day that could be a problem
3853719 basically all federal money is in jeopardy they dont mess around
3853720 wed have to find a parking spot close because thats hard on us older folks to walk far
3853721 its a little bit better for us to ride than to walk
3853722 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services
3853723 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor this has put transit agencies in direct competition with private charter operators for these services and transit agencies always win because public subsidized transit agency rates are lower
3853724 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price
3853725 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry
3853726 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore
3853727 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely
3853728 i dont want to beat a dead horse here but i think its going to be very difficult for them to have to make a profit and charge a reasonable price
3853729 i think the team knows its very difficult to be perfect and i think i would rather call it personal best most of the time
3853730 thats what i believe our quest for perfection is the expectation now that weve gone 11 2 for two years is that there are only so many more wins though but ive asked them not to focus on that part
3853731 we just need to keep winning games and keep working down toward no 10
3853732 if we want to end the year playing in a bcs game then weve got to start somewhere seventeen is a good place to start and hopefully well be one of the top 10 by the end of the season
3853733 there isnt one player nor a coach that is satisfied with being mwc champs
3853734 personal best is what we want we dont measure it by number of wins like the world would do we want more players and staff members to do the best they are capable of i havent done that yet and thats what were trying to get done
3853735 with coach mendenhall what you see is what you get
3853736 we wouldnt have it on the t shirt if we didnt want to win all of our games this year so thats what were going to try to do
3853737 you never plan on losing we have expectations to win every game as you should every time but we trust the players that are on our team and we know we can be successful
3853738 were going to do everything we can do to do it be perfect
3853739 but if we dont go undefeated is that going to be a failure of a season probably not
3853740 former head coach lavell edwards had 23 championships in 29 years and we have two i dont know how many conference championships well have but i do know consistency will have a big impact on that
3853741 ryan orton is really making a move right now at the guard position
3853742 i mean hes really making a strong move right now i like what hes doing a lot
3853743 we really like what were seeing out of ryan wynn at right tackle
3853744 we think weve got them in the right spots in the long run but they all are a little bit interchangeable between tackle and guard
3853745 its good that we have a lot of competition for the spots because competition does nothing but make you better
3853746 d j and i were in the same position last year so we can help them out
3853747 we want to finish games this year whereas last year we were up on teams like delaware who ended up going to the football championship subdivision national championship
3853748 we want to be able to finish those games this year and thats why this year our motto on defense is no excuses its kind of like the pats just shut up do your job and make sure we finish every single game its not over til the whistle
3853749 if the offense has got to blend itself into a defensive scheme that says you should throw the football were going to throw the football
3853750 i think it happens that we have a smart enough quarterback who can get us into those plays once in a while
3853751 if the defense is going to say well were going to back off and you have to try and run the football then well run the football try to allow the quarterback to give us the best opportunity to move the football team that way
3853752 well always search for methods with which to run the football but were not going to be afraid to throw the football either
3853753 we have new plays going obviously but were doing a lot more quarters style of defense this year coverage and different zone pressures but basically its the same as weve been running in the spring and last fall
3853754 thats a derivative of the fact that akinniyi is a guy that can also line up on the line of scrimmage and show a good rush
3853755 he showed some of that last year when we were in a four man front as well youll see a little more of that this year because of the multiplicity that weve placed together in the package
3853756 to learn more about customer experience than their competitors should
3853757 companies must examine experience from the customers point of view
3853758 i loved playing under coach g and the entire staff they were like my family away from home and i will miss them all
3853759 the staff and i wish niqky nothing but the best of luck
3853760 i am changing my name because master p is who i used to be i call it my childhood and p miller marks my manhood i wouldnt change my past because it has groomed me to be the man i am today growing up has nothing to do with age people grow up mentally and spiritually through life experiences but when you come from hip hop it is almost impossible to get past the stereo type it associates you with i will always love hip hop it plays a major role in who i am today i have branched out into so many different arenas that range from being the first african american to have a clothing line at wal mart to writing books and speaking on capitol hill but all of that gets overshadowed because i come from the hip hop industry its important for young hip hop artists to know that they are not limited to one career they can educate themselves and prepare for life after hip hop the same way pro athletes prepare themselves for life after sports also know that you can branch out into other avenues if you are multi talented or have other dreams my dream was to enter corporate america my sons dream is to go to college and play basketball and will smiths was to be a famous actor many of us can begin new careers take advantage of different opportunities and still remain true to hip hop there are a lot of people out there who are afraid to grow up and change but im not and p miller is the evolution of me percy miller the entrepreneur the businessman my goal is to educate the hip hop culture now and if they dont get it then hopefully their kids will get it and understand my fellow hip hop artists should know that we cant rap forever im glad im in a position in my life where i dont have to put out music because ive prepared myself for the future to build the generational wealth we have to educate our families thats why my son is going to college fifteen years later im still successful because ive realized the importance of education growing up and responsibility

3853769 we have presented a respectable result in view of the difficult conditions this result confirms our course of continuing to focus on safety in terms of new business as well as risk and cost management
3853770 the next months will continue to be challenging for the entire financial sector the fact that market prospects are still uncertain means that it is almost impossible to make reliable forecasts however one aspect has been demonstrated by recent
3853771 so far we limited pure logistics investments to our eurologistik 1institutional fund which owns real estate assets worth approximately 300 million with the acquisition of comet we are expanding our activities in this market segment to include our hausinvest europa public fund
3853772 in face of the ongoing globalization and the anticipated increase in haulage volumes worldwide the market for logistics properties is bound to keep growing before this background we intend to further expand the share of hausinvest europa in the business at the same time the comet marks the first logistics property we bought in england in this sense the property enhances the funds spread in regard to both diversification by type of usage and diversification by country

3853784 our people continue to face a profound humanitarian crisis this destructive policy of banning humanitarian assistance can be reversed with one letter
3853785 tragically zimbabwe has become one of the worst man made humanitarian disasters of a new and hopeful century
3853786 because of the failed policies of zanu pf 5 million zimbabweans now face starvation and famine we cannot allow this to happen
3853787 we knew negotiations would be difficult but a resolution that represents anything other than the will of the zimbabwean people would be a disaster for our country

3853867 not every fighting is warfare while georgia is obviously under a ddos attack and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3853868 coulda shoulda the nature of whats going on isnt clear but until we are certain anything state sponsored is happening on the internet it is my official opinion this is not warfare but just some unaffiliated attacks by russian hackers and or some rioting by enthusiastic russian supporters
3853869 what matters is that the internet is being used as a tool in warfare
3853870 lets not put a diminutive feel on these cyberattacks a ddos attack is still a serious event and according to

3853876 but they feel stress they feel time constraints they have to deal with pre authorizations its not the kind of practice they wanted theyre stressed and that leads to moving patients along
3853877 as a doctor in todays medical system its difficult to deal with chronic pain conditions
3853878 most practices are forced to see a certain number of patients in a limited amount of time with chronic pain its not so simple as five minutes a few questions and handing out a pill it takes some time and our system isnt set up for that
3853879 the patient needs to realize that the doctor may not be able to discern whats going on in the first visit often it takes a few visits
3853880 if you say its really depressing and upsetting me im in so much pain
3853881 doctors will see it in terms of emotion and treat it as an emotional problem referring you to psychiatric care or antidepressants

3853913 the apollo moon shot and the human genome project rallied support for massive r amp d efforts that created the capabilities to overcome obstacles that were not contemplated at the outset of these initiatives
3853914 similarly todays barriers to improving biofuels are significant but genetics and genomics can catalyze progress towards delivering in the not too distant future economically viable and more socially acceptable biofuels based on lignocellulose
3853915 over the past 10 000 years wild plant species were selected for their desirable traits resulting in todays highly productive food crops we simply dont have thousands of years in the face of the energy and climate challenges so by applying the power of genomics to these problems we are seeking to speed up the domestication of energy crops and the technologies for converting them to suitable biofuels as a more carbon neutral approach to meeting part of our transportation needs
3853916 with the data that we are generating from plant genomes we can home in on relevant agronomic traits such as rapid growth drought resistance and pest tolerance as well as those that define the basic building blocks of the plants cell wall cellulose hemicellulose and lignin biofuels researchers are able to take this information and design strategies to optimize the plants themselves as biofuels feedstocks altering for example branching habit stem thickness and cell wall chemistry resulting in plants that are less rigid and more easily broken down
3853917 using this prospecting technique we can survey the vast microbial biodiversity to gain a better picture of the metabolic potential of genes and how they can be enlisted for the enzymatic deconstruction of biomass and subsequent conversion to high energy value fuels
3853918 given the daunting magnitude of fossil fuel used for transportation we will likely have to draw from several different sources to make an appreciable impact with cellulosic biofuels all of which will in some significant way will be informed by genomics
3853919 toward this end rapid new sequencing methods and the large scale genomics previously applied to sequencing the human genome are being exploited by bioenergy researchers to design next generation biofuels higher chain alcohols and alkanes with higher energy content than petroleum and more adaptable to existing infrastructure
3853920 we already know that furin seems to have roles in a variety of human diseases such as cancer cystic fibrosis and infectious diseases
3853921 these findings show that having no furin in certain immune system cells can increase the immune response and lead to autoimmune disease in mice
3853922 inhibiting furin has been thought to reduce growth of malignant cells or to block infections by preventing essential activation of a pathogen
3853923 however these results suggest that the development of drug interventions could have an unexpected side effect of increasing the risk of developing autoimmune disease

3853927 i dont know how political it was i had a high profile case
3853928 i went through all the training i served honorably in my unit i used army provisions to try become a noncombatant and remain in the army as a medic or something but i still would be subject to going on combat missions as a medic
3853929 i cant bring myself to shoot another person if people want to criticize me for that then im honored to be criticized because im not a killer

3853932 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more

3853941 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea
3853942 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3853943 its not just music for the united states its world music
3853944 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
3853945 its totally given me a new energey a new everything
3853946 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
3853947 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
3853948 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3853949 with my fan base being broader and larger now im looking to somewhere where somebody can really take advantage of that and take it to the next level
3853950 in all we expect cpi inflation to rise to about 5 7 per cent year on year in august as household energy prices rise even though oil prices are lower reaching about 5 per cent year on year by year end thereafter even with the recent drop in global commodity prices and the likelihood that the uk economy is in recession we expect cpi inflation to stay above 3 per cent until quarter three next year staying also above the 2 per cent target throughout 2009 and 2010
3853951 within the next couple of months looks well off the agenda
3853952 it is vital that pay rises keep pace with inflation to ensure that our standard of living is not slashed over coming months better pay would also improve consumer confidence and lessen the chances of a long and deep economic slowdown next year
3853953 profiteering oil firms or it is inevitable that wages will have to rise in response to these higher prices
3853954 certainly everything has gone up hugely feed went up a huge amount last year from about 146 a tonne to 220 a tonne the transport situation has had a huge impact on us as well we are paying about 300 a month extra on diesel
3853955 we have no way of controlling that either the cost of the grain or the amount we feed the birds the birds have to be fed and that is our biggest issue
3853956 it has been extremely difficult although the supermarkets have moved they generally moved a bit behind the prices we have had to pay
3853957 we have ordered food in advance knowing we would lose money if they did not move it has all been hand to mouth
3853958 pig farmers are suffering huge losses because they also have huge inputs and the marketplace is not matching that in terms of farm gate prices so they are making losses the eggs guys are just about staying afloat
3853959 it comes back to the supermarkets in the end there is this imbalance of power within the supply chain the supermarkets are at the top wielding all the power and farmers have very little negotiating power and get railroaded by the supermarkets
3853960 at the moment we are seeing efforts from supermarkets to keep their shelf prices down so they can keep their customers happy
3853961 the fall in transactions is an effect of the credit crunch and i guess some people are just waiting to see what happens next
3853962 however in terms of prices the scottish housing market is reverting to type when you compare it with a few years ago
3853963 the bottom line is house price increases are at a level much nearer inflation which makes for a much more sensible and sustainable market
3853964 mom come on it will be fun and we will be able to hang out together
3853965 were going to have to move after were done filming
3853966 you can hear the tour guides like just yesterday we saw lauren conrad pulling into her driveway and she stopped to get the mail
3853967 and lo lauren bosworth was walking down the street one day and they were like here on the left we have a celebrity dog walker walking chloe
3853968 i believe in a private ballot i dont want to ever influence someones vote or have my vote change someones opinion of me
3853969 even before superbad came out i think the studio was trying to get seth rogen and evan goldberg to write a sequel but they really didnt want to write a sequel i guess the kids would go to college or something like that that was the studios idea and so an answer to that was to do a superbad pineapple express crossover an unprecedented crossover movie with two directors greg motolla and david gordon green each directing half of the movie and somehow these characters get together which doesnt make sense at all but could work
3853970 i could sell them the characters from superbad something but i think wed want some action so you know somehow the kids get in trouble somehow and we have to get them out of it and seth plays characters in both movies so somehow wed have to kill one of them off
3853971 it was a great visual style very dynamic and so action heavy it really delivered
3853972 george lucas made the decision to go with cg animation as opposed to traditional 2d animation
3853973 i come from 2d and had thrown around some ideas of using a combination but he really wanted to develop a way to shoot animation in 3d
3853974 i do my best to keep up with the different elements of the star wars universe
3853975 but there are far greater fans than i i have a great deal of respect for george as a filmmaker but believe it or not we dont always agree and we dispute decisions
3853976 hell make broad stroke suggestions work with us on final cut of an episode and let us know when he thinks we are off track
3853977 companies are increasingly realizing the old ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure adage
3853978 if youre really aggressive in disease management programs and wellness programs you can tie them to what employees pay for their health care management and see a cost reduction
3853979 these are not necessarily new programs but theyre getting more and more traction
3853980 with health costs still on the upswing and senior leadership looking to do something about those costs executives have been more receptive to trying these programs
3853981 we all fall victim to going forward year to year and just offering the standard benefits plan that has always been offered
3853982 many companies arent getting it that the employee has to have a say in the program
3853983 obviously theres history here its been liberal for quite some time
3853984 this riding may surprise some people that feeling of being taken for granted is a disagreeable sentiment

3853990 shes also 22 years old i think people forget that
3853991 with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3853992 if a sparrow cannot fall to the ground without his gods notice is it probable that an empire can rise without his aid
3853993 that henceforth prayers imploring the assistance of heaven and its blessings on our deliberations be held in this assembly every morning before we proceed to business

3853997 people dont think about cutthroat trout like that these fish are behaving like salmon the bear river is their ocean
3853998 they spend the winter in big habitat and then spawn in small creeks if they can find them
3853999 our offensive line is doing a phenomenal job not only in pass protection but getting the run checks right and opening up holes for harvey
3854000 you saw harvey walk into the end zone untouched today
3854001 that just happens all the time when the water gets rough but the waters calm
3854002 probably have my whole life yeah im concerned but not that concerned ive probably swam in much worse
3854003 i think were just gonna jump in and go for it
3854004 people who would swim i mean good luck to you
3854005 i just hope you dont catch nothing and get sick im not taking the risk
3854006 the number looks disturbingly bullish but well probably see some rebound in gasoline supplies next week now that refineries are back online after the storm
3854007 weve got a good sized really going here today but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3854008 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3854009 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3854010 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3854011 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3854012 i dont think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3854013 the art print came today and it looks great were building a new house in hawaii and this will look great thanks
3854014 so pleased to be purchasing this art print of yours it is beautiful and will im sure look stunning in the home we will soon be building at the beach
3854015 hi michael i received my print and i love it it will have a place of honor in our home thanks for the prompt service
3854016 i received my print earlier this week i am so happy with it it is absolutely beautiful i am always in awe of someone who can create something so wonderful i cant wait to get it up on my wall soon thank you so much not only for the lovely print but for packing it so well
3854017 michael i just wanted to drop you a line and tell you how nice the picture is in fact much nicer in person than i thought i can hardly wait to get it framed
3854018 just a brief note to tell you how much i love my print notify me if you have any other prints available
3854019 i have received your lovely print it will be a beautiful addition to my home it will look great with my hawaiian longboard collection thank you
3854020 i received the print on tuesday it is beautiful thanks for the fast turnaround
3854021 octopuses do have very strong personalities they do develop their own favourite toys
3854022 my octopus hates the colour red thats quite a natural response in nature but he particularly likes yellow were starting to build a profile for different octopus
3854023 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3854024 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3854025 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3854026 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3854027 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3854028 i think thats horrible because thats my doctors office right down the street there
3854029 no one comes in our waiting room and just sits unless we know who they are
3854030 you assume they work there they could be a doctor themselves
3854031 but i never saw anyone else like family or kids
3854032 were just glad we were able to get to them

3854041 there was an alternative thought to let him have the parade and then prosecute him but then he wins he gets a thousand dollar fine and a slap on the wrist with a wet bus ticket
3854042 the boobs on bikes parade is a commercial stunt advertising an r 18 event with sexualised nudity in a public street that is offensive to many people and completely inappropriate for young people and children to view
3854043 the only thing that can stop it is rain or if i get arrested
3854044 they are simply the public made realer less fictional more able less predictable
3854045 if you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it people will eventually come to believe it

3854053 if children are in good shape and they warm up and prepare themselves for the game they can decrease stress to their joints and avoid injuring them
3854054 a loss of concentration can cause injuries as well so its important to help children focus on the game when playing sports
3854055 overall physical activity is good for all children and being prepared to participate in sports can be the best way to avoid injury
3854056 shit i wrote that i do viral marketing on my resume and our site is not viral so what do i do now
3854057 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3854058 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3854059 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3854060 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3854061 all of my life ive been in hiding wishing there was someone just like you now that youre here now that ive found you i know that youre the one to pull me through deliver me loving and caring deliver me giving and s haring deliver me this cross that im bearing

3854064 startup tips how i grew a waiting list of 20 000 at mint com part i
3854065 i think for many new startups the largest challenge is distribution outside of fb apps to get people to use their service many rely on a techcrunch post or the hope of a digg article mint was rewarded with those but i think its even more valuable to have the right audience checking out your site from the beginning
3854066 while we are cutting costs across the organization it isimportant to note that we intend to increase our investment inresearch and development projects which will remain thelifeblood of the company
3854067 the market is coming down today due to the decoupling after the stronger dollar and lower oil price driven rally over the last week
3854068 i want to write that policy and i will do whatever it takes
3854069 it gets back to whatever i do in business its always about dollars and sense
3854070 with some fighters its not with some fighters it is theres just so many variables
3854071 i think that if you go into an organization whether its fighting or promotion if you feel youre worth something and you dont go after it youre never going to know what youre worth i go through 90 percent of my contracts with fighters everybodys different
3854072 it is needless to say my social life is practically nil and perhaps the publicity from your book may brighten my life
3854073 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3854074 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3854075 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3854076 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3854077 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3854078 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her

3854080 mccains decision to cozy up to one of the central figures in the republican culture of corruption
3854081 no position title or official role in the mccain campaign and am not seeking one
3854082 will be coming to atlanta on august 18 for a very special event at the marriott marquis downtown and i have agreed to serve as a member of the mccain victory 2008 team
3854083 if you select to use your credit card you may fax the form to me
3854084 its laughable democrats would try to make this a political issue considering john mccain led the abramoff investigations and has a record of fighting to reform washington
3854085 do you think you might be able to contact karl as i am sure you have more weight there
3854086 talked to rove about this and i think i killed it hes on it keep this between us dont want to raise expectations but i banged on this one hard
3854087 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3854088 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3854089 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3854090 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3854091 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3854092 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3854093 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3854094 people have been calling and asking if were closing for good freemans has been closed all this week for repairs to re do the kitchen line for our new chef michael citarella attached is photo of what the dining room looks like today we will be re opening on friday for dinner new menu coming in early september
3854095 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3854096 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3854097 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3854098 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
3854099 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
3854100 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour
3854101 they dont seem to be doing any good anymore and it appears they are upsetting some people
3854102 if you have too many plants then it provides too much coverage for the fish and its too hard for anglers to get to
3854103 even though we have a body of water that doesnt have good formal access 36 of the users at that time were coming from a good distance away
3854104 thats the quality of the fishery that we have here
3854105 when the dam was sited it was understood that sedimentation would be coming in and youd be losing volume over time
3854106 we dont have a good definition of how much is in the usable volume and how much is in the dead storage where it was intended to drop out
3854107 a buffer of a 100 feet is said to achieve a 75 reduction in sediments and a 40 reduction in nutrients
3854108 at what point do we want to have public input do we want to have it as the usual type of public hearing where everyone stands up for three minutes or do we want to have a facilitated visioning process in which people get to talk about what they want to see in this reservoir
3854109 but in other areas of the reservoir there may be some sand bars building up
3854110 whats out there there might be different problems in different areas of the reservoirs and different solutions
3854111 so that we can determine when we go to steward the reservoir to meet those uses we have a very clear idea of what were stewarding the reservoir to achieve
3854112 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3854113 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3854368 i feel i have learnt a lot in the time i have been here during probably one of the most difficult periods in the clubs history
3854369 i have witnessed some major changes to the club off the field
3854370 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3854371 i thought we got some great work in today i thought both sides were very professional in their approach we have a little different schemes on both sides of the ball and it was good work for dallas and obviously the broncos we have a practice this afternoon and im looking forward to that
3854372 they have a different type of offense and a different type of defense we get a chance to work against a 3 4 look and they get a chance to take a look at a four man front i thought it was good for both teams it was a very healthy practice and there was some good fresh hitting you go against somebody where you dont know their tendencies so everybody plays a little bit more honest and its a good evaluation process for us
3854373 what you want to do when youre taking a look at your otas when youre taking a look at your summer camp you want to find your best 53 guys that can play you want to get better as a scheme offensively defensively and special teams this is a little bit different here normally that third week of practice you get tired of hitting against each other this is a good changeup for both teams where you get a chance to go against different schemes and different people i thought it was good for both squads
3854374 normally the first couple of weeks of training camp you want to install your offense and defense to go against a team too early would kind of take away what you are trying to put in as your basic fundamentals to installing your offense defense and special teams usually its better before your second preseason game because you have all of that installation in you have a preseason game under your belt you know who you want to evaluate and you get a chance to do it against different people
3854375 you change it up we went there last year obviously they are playing at our facility so they are going to come here we will probably do the same thing next year if we play the cowboys in preseason
3854376 we brought in a couple of corners poole and cb wale dada that we thought would give us more depth at that position guys that we feel have more of a chance to make our football team sometimes you make changes after a game based on how they play we didnt feel like either of those players cb lamont reid and cb christian morton could make our football team so we went in a different direction and brought some guys in that we thought could compete for possibly making our squad
3854377 he has been playing with the first team and second team throughout camp we have some competition there at middle linebacker and we will find out at the end of camp who steps up and who is our starter we have two guys koutouvides and lb nate webster that are practicing extremely well and we want to give both guys a chance to practice and play with the first team unit part of the evaluation process is how they play in practice and how thy play here in the games so we will have a chance to do both
3854378 i dont know if he picks his play up any more brandon has been doing this throughout camp i think you get a chance to see him against different people and obviously a very good football team in the cowboys its always nice to see a guy step up and make some plays like he did
3854379 naturally it does players and coaches you want to perform in front of your peers you want to practice well you want to play well and at the same time we want to evaluate a lot of people we have a chance to do it all today
3854380 to be honest with you they take advantage of an opportunity rb selvin young was obviously injured at texas but he came in here stayed healthy and took advantage of an opportunity any time you get a scholarship and are averaging about five and a half to six yards per carry at texas you know you have a big upside and he is taking advantage of that opportunity here
3854381 well he guaranteed 2 000 yards i think so he is going to be much better we have a long way to go though
3854382 i thought it went well obviously they are one of the best teams in the nfl theyre big physical and fast it went well though we are going to go back and look at the tapes to see what we did well and what we didnt do so well on but its definitely good to get somebody else in here instead of the same defenses over and over again i thought it went well
3854383 thats exactly what it is for us we have a young team with a lot of new guys dallas is one of the top three teams in the nfl it gives us a good measuring stick to see where we are at and exactly how far we need to go
3854384 dallas is dallas and they are going to do whatever they are going to do we are the broncos and we are not going to try and emulate them we are going to handle ourselves exactly the way our owner does and the way mike shanahan does we are going to be first class and go about our business
3854385 i talked with him before practice and he has dealt with it for a long time he said it was manageable just like i have been doing for the last four or five months he went through his career with it and i dont see any reason why i cant
3854386 we have two young guys on the outside ryan clady and ryan harris they are young but they are fighting i think they are going to be good if not great tackles in the future both ryans got a taste against houston and this is going to be a good test for them in the next two days im comfortable and i think they have done a great job so far
3854387 you see some guys breathing a little bit harder brandon marshall was gassed because he was so juiced up you have adrenaline running and it is fun it is game like out here and you get to see somebody different go against different looks and gauge where you are at i love doing it

3854391 he was a young kid and they just wanted it to be over their feeling was that he will probably end up in trouble again and end up serving that time at the court they felt he was apologetic on that he was to go to jail but not for killing someone i dont know how you live with something like that
3854392 something tragic happens and there are people who take advantage of it and dont do their jobs they are responsible for taking care of those who didnt do anything wrong that sentence was a slap in the face david was a great person and its really sad theres no accountability no responsibility today the whole situation is unfortunate for what he took away i dont think 21 days is appropriate its a tragedy
3854393 we have to look at the defendant and his background and the facts of the case we consult with family members and make what we feel is an appropriate sentence the purpose of a sentence is rehabilitation punishment and deterrence

3854421 there is nothing wrong in being called sexy i think the term itself has been misunderstood people think that a person is sexy only if she is wearing tiny clothes but for me being sexy is about being mysterious and having your own personality and certainly has nothing to do with a persons fashion sense

3854445 if vodafone itself admits that it is standard practice then it stands to reason that the same practice applied to gt and we will like to know the people who are playing that role for vodafone and what they are getting out of it it is based on vodafones own admission

3854477 the responsibility of identifying companies entirely lies with invest in mauritius which will do the due diligence for the companies that want to recruit for instance things to do with living conditions and terms of service

3854859 just the stamina that hes had year after year and the proceeds from the event increasing exponentially thats whats unbelievable
3854860 literally last year we were in a tight financial situation until we got matts 14 000 donation which was enough to keep us going where we could line up more funding
3854861 when you look at our budget which is in the low 50 000s the donation is a big chunk of our budget and unlike grants matt allows us to use the money for more than just the handholds

3854938 hey i just took apart your silly comment on daily kos here
3854939 building local communities by keeping good stuff out of landfills
3854940 there are people offering fully functional appliances and computers and people offering half a bottle of cologne and people have a mutual respect for any level of participation
3854941 when folks reach out to answer and meet others needs they support not just another person or family they support the greater community
3854942 this kind of caring for your neighbor has a ripple effect
3854943 the real purpose of freecycle is to reduce waste save precious resources and ease the burden on our landfills
3854944 freecycle accomplishes this by offering area residents a way to pass unneeded items on to other local residents who can make continued use of it
3854945 if you stacked all the exchanged items from this past year in garbage trucks with several tons per truck it would amount to five times the height of mt everest
3854946 were helping people avoid the whole consumerism thing by giving renewed life to things rather than going out and buying new ones
3854947 it feels good making something available that you dont have any use for

3854956 we are very honored to have california florida and arizona regulators come together to share their knowledge and experience with life industry compliance professionals
3854957 these regulators have been leaders at both the state and naic levels on senior protection and other important industry issues
3854958 their participation and perspective will be of great value to attendees who need to stay on top of regulatory needs and expectations
3854959 when products releasing high levels of vocs are applied indoors voc emissions can adsorb into porous construction materials and furnishings causing the emissions to linger even longer
3854960 the selection of low emitting paints versus low voc content paints will minimize this impact and result in a higher quality of acceptable indoor air for building occupants and homeowners
3854961 we have encountered unique and difficult market conditions in the first six months of 2008 the extreme price increases in petroleum and petrochemical prices has been unprecedented and has affected our sales and cost of sales we have passed on price increases to our customers however due to the rapid increase in oil prices there was a delay in being able to pass along increases to our customers which affected margins on a short term basis higher oil prices directly affect the discretionary spending on everything including recreational boating the decrease in recreational boating slowed the sales of our products at the retail level the company also experienced higher cost of freight in addition to material cost increases that adversely affected our gross margin percent of sales
3854962 despite all the negative economic factors endured in the second quarter of the year the company was able to break even we are cautiously optimistic as we enter the second half of the year as oil prices start to drop we believe as the industry picks up we will be the benefactor of increase sales due to our sales and marketing activities

3854969 it is important to understand that extra credit card fees will occur when you are vacationing in another country
3854970 canadians need to understand these foreign exchange and cash advance fees in order to budget for their travel expenses and determine their best course of action for making purchases abroad or withdrawing funds
3854971 there is a lot to consider when it comes to using your credit card while travelling abroad
3854972 to learn more about foreign conversion and cash advance fees i invite consumers to read our booklet called service fees on credit card transactions i also encourage consumers to use our interactive tool if they are shopping around for a new credit card so that they can pick the one that best suits their needs
3854973 we are very pleased to report continued record production and financial performance in the second quarter these results exhibit how we are consistently improving our mining operations

3854982 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3854983 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea
3854984 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field

3855000 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
3855001 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

3855006 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
3855007 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
3855008 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
3855009 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
3855010 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3855011 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3855012 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance

3855032 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
3855033 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
3855034 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
3855035 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
3855036 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
3855037 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
3855038 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
3855039 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
3855040 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
3855041 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
3855042 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
3855043 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
3855044 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits

3855067 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3855068 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3855069 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
3855070 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
3855071 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
3855072 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
3855073 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
3855074 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
3855075 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
3855076 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
3855077 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
3855078 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
3855079 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
3855080 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
3855081 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
3855082 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
3855083 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
3855084 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
3855085 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
3855086 n he me det godt 2008 for vi hadde det fillen utrolig godt
3855087 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

3855089 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3855090 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
3855091 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
3855092 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
3855093 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
3855094 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
3855095 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
3855096 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
3855097 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
3855098 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
3855099 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
3855100 lets stop pretending that healing the sick is like trading a commodity lets stop diverting doctors energies into unholy bidding wars for jobs they already do

3855105 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3855106 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3855107 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3855108 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3855109 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

3855113 will oblige private banks to adopt policies which employ new investment deposits to obtain the proceeds to meet their needs
3855114 is a usual matter for the protection of banking work wholly
3855115 the central bank instructions require the banks to maintain reserves of deposits by 25 and 20 of which was deposited at the central bank maintains a significant 5 remaining cash to meet demand
3855116 it was allowed for state institutions to deal with private banks a jurisprudence says that the private banks to deposit 75 of government deposits with the central bank to have the remaining 25 only for investment
3855117 there is a new resolution being issued to maintain the previous ratio of 25 only cash reserve
3855118 will be a new mechanism for the use of deposits based on deposits that are not used for governmental purposes placement in central bank nor in the purchase of remittances of central treasury
3855119 is subject to a new mechanism in use that not to let the proportion of which is used to buy treasury transfers or remittances for central bank deposit or investment in the central bank to overtake 35
3855120 it would put private banks to face a new stage and being imposed to invest their funds any surpluses in financial market operations and new projects
3855121 is an advanced and was expected to announce in august last year
3855122 the monetary authority preferred to replace by the gradual reduction of interest which dropped from 20 to 17 so far
3855123 improvement in the deal they will stand as he says on an equal footing with state owned banks including requiring banks to correct their management
3855124 the central bank to issue clear instructions based on the executing laws in order the private banks would begin working to implement the new stage
3855125 i swear to you ill even buy you dinner governor thanks a lot

3855129 office connector really ramped up our adoption of the wiki across the company
3855130 those not familiar with wiki editing now have a much simpler way to publish and edit the wiki through microsoft office
3855131 the new search capabilities are a major bonus to users all around search is easier faster and more intuitive
3855132 weve also made improvements to some of our most popular macros galleries and charts in addition there s a new pagetree macro designed to make documentation management much easier
3855133 this represents not only the best integration with microsoft office of any enterprise wiki application but also a very smooth experience across both microsoft and atlassian products

3855162 los cristianos tienen la culpa de todo desastre p blico y toda desgracia que sobreviene al pueblo
3855163 tal caterva de miserables era claramente digna del exterminio y toda medida de represi n tomada contra ellos por la autoridad pod a estar segura de contar con al aprobaci n popular
3855164 insania y furia al ver a su hijo deslizarse fuera de su control
3855165 su origen jud o su indiferencia ante la pol tica y los asuntos p blicos su aversi n a las costumbres paganas eran interpretadas como un odium generis humani odio de la raza humana y esto hizo que un intento de parte de ellos de destruir la ciudad fuera lo suficientemente plausible como para justificar un veredicto de culpables
3855166 ah comenz un carnaval de sangre como nunca hab a visto la roma pagana y nunca ver a despu s una vasta multitud de cristianos fueron muertos de la forma m s espantosa

3855169 l insult a los jud os y cristianos por igual al erigir templos de j piter y venus sobre el sitio del templo y el supuesto lugar de la crucifixi n
3855170 era irrelevante que los cristianos sostuvieran que las historias maliciosas que se circulaban sobre ellos eran falsas eran hechos y no palabras lo que exig a el estado y si eran realmente ciudadanos leales como aduc an hab a una forma sencilla de demostrar su lealtad dejarlos que ofrecieran una pizca de incienso en honor del emperador que juraran por su divinidad y que lo invocaran como se or
3855171 se promulg una ley durante su reinado que castigaba a todos los exiliados que intentaran influir la mente de las personas mediante el temor a la divinidad y esta ley estaba dirigida indudablemente a los cristianos
3855172 la resoluci n misma de los cristianos frente al sufrimiento y a la muerte que podr a haber obtenido por s misma el respeto de un estoico se explicaba no como una fortaleza elogiable sino como una obstinaci n perversa marco despreciaba lo que le parec a ser la superstici n crasa de las creencias cristianas que los descalificaba del respeto otorgado a otros que manten an sus principios al costo de la vida misma
3855173 los cad veres de los m rtires que cubr an las calles

3855175 fortaleci a los dem s sus atormentadores se agotaron en sus intentos de hacer que renunciara a cristo
3855176 muchos m rtires son quemados confinados o decapitados a diario ante nuestros ojos
3855177 esta fue la se al para una persecuci n que en extensi n consistencia y crueldad super a todas las anteriores
3855178 todas las copias de la biblia deb an ser quemadas todos los cristianos fueron privados de cargos p blicos y derechos civiles y finalmente todos sin excepci n deb an hacer sacrificios a los dioses so pena de muerte

3855233 it has long been one of the objectives of the isi to project the hurriyat as the true representative of the kashmiris though it failed in the past it now appears to have gained some ground towards it this time particularly when even the mainstream political party pdp became part of the design by joining hurriyats march to muzaffarabad call
3855234 the solution to the amarnath land row may be arrived at sooner than later but the matter which brought the kashmiris on roads has relegated the efforts for normalcy in j amp k to the background

3855238 this election cycle a lot of barriers are being broken
3855239 at the congressional level we are showing that people are willing to elect a candidate based on their values and ideas and not their sexual orientation

3855242 if i go to play with a taller team and i put here raising up on the tips of his toes it is not an offense
3855243 some of us didnt feel comfortable doing it just because to me it was a little clownish for our part to be doing that
3855244 but the sponsors insisted and insisted i think it is just a bad idea i guess to do that but it was never intended to be offensive or racist against anybody
3855245 i didnt find it very funny i didnt find it offensive either i guess some guys didnt mind to me i dont want to be that way i guess to be doing that stuff
3855246 if anybody feels offended by it we totally apologize for it we never meant anything offensive by it
3855247 if you put it in the wrong context and put it with the wrong people or a different kind of people you could take it that way
3855248 but not with our group and not with our people i would find that a wrong read
3855249 while there is no such thing as a totally secure system especially a system that is accessible across the internet our belief is that with the right technology the new generation of cloud computing system can be made as secure if not more secure than existing server based office systems

3855253 and i told him thats exactly what this is all about and if nothing else this letter just taught you a life lesson
3855254 it seems totally unbelievable that somebody would even go to that extreme to send a letter to somebody let alone looking to find something about child labor laws
3855255 if my doors close and i never open again and this boy becomes successful then i will be the happiest person in the world
3855256 its strange that a kid at this age would glean onto this particular kind of music and show the intensity and kind of the ability to function as kind of 8 year old blues guy

3855278 the most dynamic situation is unfolding in the peruvian amazon
3855279 the elimination of new oil access roads could significantly reduce the impacts of most projects
3855280 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3855281 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognize that indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent

3855366 after a 10 month lull we have recorded avian influenza outbreaks in two northern states and laboratory analysis showed that the virus belongs to the sub type related to a different kind of bird flu that is found in europe
3855367 it is likely the new strain might have been introduced to the country by migratory birds
3855368 this is an indication that our surveillance and control strategies are working as we have successfully controlled the earlier introduction and our surveillance network is vigilant enough to detect this newly introduced strain as soon as it came into the country

3855373 the president means business on this issue and wants to see more commitment in this direction
3855374 if you are observant you must have noticed improvement in power supply in the last three weeks that is because some things have been done by the federal government within the last one month the president has effectively tackled the problem of system collapse which has gone on for years
3855375 he has also sorted out the issue of funding for the short term with the governors and once the monies are duly appropriated in the state houses of assembly and by the national assembly everything will be in place the strategies for the long term are also in place
3855376 but there are some technical details that are being sorted out with the international oil companies
3855377 some of them are showing signs of non cooperation but now they are beginning to realise the resolve of the president because once the emergency is declared in the power sector there will be stiff sanctions if they fail to meet their obligations and all these will be clearly spelt out as pre condition for continued operations in our country
3855378 what we should be talking about is food security not food production that is what matters and that is what people will not understand

3855460 i think its an exciting game our team is a very good team with some great ambassadors for their sport and for young kids theyve been great role models

3855500 i think we all recognize that in a world of electronic trading where there are more venues and more opportunities where people may be able to hide their activity consolidating the review of insider trading activity was critical
3855501 we have immediately published this proposal for public comment because of its potential to increase the likelihood that those who engage in insider trading will be caught and punished

3855507 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3855508 it means that georgian ports and airports will be taken under the control of the u s defence ministry in order to conduct humanitarian and other missions this is a very important statement for easing tension

3855521 i wasnt much of a fighter or a lover you said dont get excited but take cover
3855522 were definitely interested in that whole world we werent carneys growing up but we grew up outside of society in a way poor and screwing around in the woods and committing small acts of vandalism and misdemeanors a few felonies but nothing serious
3855523 so to an extent we idolize characters like that because thats what all the greatest books weve read faulkner and hemingway and cormac mccarthy write about the real true americans and the real true people of the world no one wants to hear a fucking song about the king and the queen anymore
3855524 we do have a thing for guns laughs we own guns and we shoot guns cause a gun is america you know nothing really represents america like a gun its a dangerous seductive instrument
3855525 when you go overseas particularly in england where no one has any guns theyre always shocked at the gun references i say well im shocked your police dont have guns we hear guns going off all the time we live a quarter mile from a gun range and we have the pleasant pitter patter of rifle fire
3855526 thats sort of what americas like its vaguely fucked up wherever you live you can get a gun so easily and theres psychopaths out there that can get em and got em and thats what its all about in some ways
3855527 its hard to catch that in steely dan that theyre singing about guns and not yachts laughs theres definitely a sinister undertone to some of their songs
3855528 that makes so many people happy i dont do drugs but i drink and i know how happy a bottle of scotch can make me self medication my friend is a necessity
3855529 some people do take it too seriously theyre just too serious about their drugs its recreational and theres nothing really more to it than that its just something people like to do and be joyful when you do it because if you arent then it probably means you dont got it and youll hurt somebody to get it you gotta explore a little bit you only live so long

3855540 i just kept thinking wow greatest olympian of all time its a pretty cool title
3855541 i think hes undisputedly the greatest swimmer of all time longtime italian coach alberto castagnetti said
3855542 hes stratospheric in technical terms and in terms of mental preparation ive never seen anyone like him
3855543 he had two races that were similar freestyle and butterfly and he had a team behind him for the relays in which even i could have won
3855544 he is just a normal person but maybe from a different planet
3855545 he was saying to me i think ive figured out michael phelps
3855546 he is not from another planet he is from the future his father made him and made a time machine sixty years from now he is an average swimmer but he has come back here to mop up
3855547 being on the team with him these past couple of years a lot of us take what he does for granted
3855548 we expect him to break world records we expect him to win
3855549 i was more or less sort of counting strokes i sort of know how many strokes i take for 50 and i was hoping that i would be dead on
3855550 were doing quite a lot on it from a news perspective in the paper and also on our website
3855551 weve been carrying extensive coverage since monday and treating it as a major story
3855552 weve had medallists in european competitions but i dont know of any olympic ones
3855553 its the first games weve had so much close involvement with
3855554 theres a lot of interest in mansfield as its such an unusual thing for us
3855555 theres talk of giving her the freedom of the district and therell be quite a lot of celebrating when she comes back
3855556 pacman jones reportedly punched a female lawyer at the body tap strip club in north atlanta on january 3rd
3855557 this team celebration was short lived however as officials then threatened to hit the team with a 15 yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty should they continue as a group
3855558 we will shatter records we will pull off miracles we will make history

3855561 believes that uk historical ad spending rises cannot be sustained as advertisers pull away from decaying circulation which has fallen by 33 in the past 20 years compared with a 19 fall in the us
3855562 cautioned that uk newspaper stocks which have fallen by 40 since the start of the year compared with us papers down by 48 could fall farther
3855563 every media company will be affected in the downturn some are structurally doomed to be blunt others are cyclically challenged
3855564 to survive media companies have to make no acquisitions pay great care and attention to their core products and ensure they have solid banking relationships then they have to take a realistic rather than an overly optimistic view of just how long this is going to last
3855565 we believe that standard chartered needs to strengthen its equity tier 1 ratio from the current level of 6 1 per cent which puts it close to the bottom versus 70 asian banks under coverage
3855566 the continued dominance of wholesale versus consumer banking profits is set to reduce overall returns for the group with pressures on the groups capital likely to necessitate a sharp slowdown in asset growth or the need to raise equity at some stage
3855567 will not go down at all well at the bank of england
3855568 worryingly core inflation spiked up to 1 9 per cent in july from 1 6 per cent in june which raises concern that higher energy and food prices are increasingly having second round inflationary effects
3855569 the background is that indian law precludes foreign direct investment in multi brand retail although international retailers have been striking franchise and partnership agreements with local retailers and industrial conglomerates to allow entry to what is expected to be a large and fast growing market over the coming years
3855570 weakening consumer spending will likely hurt all ad categories in 2008 we think 2009 may be just as bad if not worse
3855571 relative upside at the other end of this tunnel with regional newspapers retaining local higher priced advertising
3855572 our view is that micro focus is very well attuned to the current economic climate anticipating that the market and operational commentary should remain positive we retain our buy
3855573 our members in johnston press want to produce high quality local papers but they are finding they have to work incredibly long hours sometimes dangerously long hours in order to do so
3855574 we have started the consultation process directly with those affected as well as through their representatives
3855575 every effort will be made to minimise the impact of these proposals on those at risk of redundancy including voluntary severance and redeployment
3855576 it would be fair to say people were expecting more editorial cuts than they johnston press have put forward
3855577 so far we havent really seen any staffers being targeted its mainly casuals some of them long term casuals who are going to be given a package to go
3855578 nobody delivers news in a way thats adapted to how young people consume media
3855579 we are very much opposed to it and the timing couldnt be worse
3855580 all media are in full steep ad slowdown and at the same time media companies are diversifying online
3855581 surging revenues and audiences online are what local media companies are about its not just a bolt on its intrinsic to business
3855582 if the bbc comes in now it would be very damaging for the sector the point is there is no need there is no market failure
3855583 it is a major development of the bbcs activities which will compete direct with our members operations in a harmful fashion
3855584 this service will ultimately be offered across every bbc platform and will therefore be in direct competition with every facet of any regional media companys multimedia portfolio whether mobile website or broadcast
3855585 what is surprising is the depth of concern in our industry we would like them bbc trust not to go ahead with the plans
3855586 we think our evidence and more particularly the evidence from our members shows to the bbc trust what an adverse effect it would have there is no public value
3855587 we have already listened carefully and have put in place a number of safeguards to manage any negative impact this includes excluding content which drives revenue for local papers such as listings jobs and singles dating limiting video content to the 60 areas the bbc already provides local news and rolling out the proposal slowly allowing the market time to plan
3855588 weve also thought about how the service might help commercial media by proposing that other local video news providers could supplement their content with the bbcs local video and by extending our existing links to websites such as those of local newspapers
3855589 if the business mix shift towards wholesale banking continues we believe the underlying profitability of the group will be undermined particularly if the benign credit conditions deteriorate as asian economic growth slows
3855590 one of the least likely to need a rights issue or face financial distress
3855591 it is clear that the adverse market conditions affecting the residential sector will continue for some time to come
3855592 in light of the current market conditions we intend to reduce the running rate of our overhead costs by 10pc by the end of this financial year
3855593 despite the challenging trading market our unique portfolio is showing relatively good liquidity
3855594 it needs to continue to reduce debt levels to protect it against a more dramatic downturn in the uk residential market than we predict and afford it the headroom to expand through acquisitions once market conditions are right to do so
3855595 there are probably enough lonmin shareholders who want to sell out and invest in other mining plays the rejection does not mean that we wont see a takeover
3855596 we see the bid as opportunistic synergy driven and likely to succeed
3855597 we see very little chance of a counter bid and it is a case of who blinks first between xstrata and the lonmin shareholders
3855598 lonmin shareholders are rightly fed up with incumbent management and we feel they will definitely not back a go it alone strategy and will want to lose this offer

3855624 its all about bringing fans together to motivate their neighborhoods locally
3855625 the video shows how the music inspires the communication and the one on one work between fans and ourselves heightens the interconnectedness and filters back out to the people who are most hungry for change

3855647 el fiscal de la forestal mininco ha estado amedrentando a las comunidades mapuche de chequenco y antinao oblig ndoles a declarar en contra de nosotros que actualmente nos encontramos recluidos en la c rcel de temuco y de angol a muchos mapuche de la comunidad se les est ofreciendo dinero y artefactos como celulares para que declaren y esp en a su propia gente
3855648 esto es una provocaci n inaceptable en un estado democr tico
3855649 es muy distinto venir aqu al lugar mismo donde est n ocurriendo los hechos y constatar que la denuncias son absolutamente efectivas esta situaci n no es tolerable en un estado democr tico
3855650 es una provocaci n inaceptable esta presencia pr cticamente militar con tanquetas micro cascos subametralladoras fusiles es algo que jam s hab a visto en mis tres per odos que llevo como parlamentario y como presidente de la comisi n de derechos humanos

3855665 since he took office martin omalley has used the maryland department of transportation for flashy environmental promises instead of providing core service to maryland travelers
3855666 the states marc train service is breaking down buses are being recalled and maryland drivers are still mired in horrific traffic jams on the states highways
3855667 what we have here is just another omalley broken promise maryland s mass transit systems are breaking down despite the governors campaign promise to make mass transit a priority this comes at a time when marylanders are turning to marc trains and mta buses more and more to get to work clearly this record of failure indicates a need for change in 2010
3855668 well the reason all of this infrastructure is falling apart is because george w bush and his oil company cronies are cutting out federal subsidies to mass transit
3855669 its a well known fact that property taxes inhibit population growth and business growth in upstate new york as a congressman i will propose that states cant pass those costs off to counties thereby reducing county property taxes in half

3855685 we categorically reject the suggestion the web ad focuses on yet another example of obamas lousy character judgment a growing list of examples that includes folks like the unrepentant terrorist william ayers the race baiting rev jeremiah wright the other race baiting preacher father phleger and the corrupt real estate wheeler dealer tony rezko
3855686 the mayor of detroit has nothing to do with tennessee but obama is running for president which does of course have something to do with tennessee
3855687 as democracy is perfected the office of president represents more and more closely the inner soul of the people on some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their hearts desire at last and the white house will be adorned by a downright moron
3855688 when fascism comes to america it will be wrapped in the flag carrying a cross
3855689 those who give up liberty for security deserve neither and will lose both
3855690 its important for our fellow citizens to understand when you think patriot act constitutional guarantees are in place when it comes to doing what is necessary to protect our homeland because we value the constitution
3855691 the power of the executive to cast a man into prison without formulating any charge known to the law and particularly to deny him the judgment of his peers is in the highest degree odious and is the foundation of all totalitarian government whether nazi or communist
3855692 to announce that there must be no criticism of the president or that we are to stand by the president right or wrong is not only unpatriotic and servile it is morally treasonable to the american public
3855693 if every single thing went extremely well id say that there is a chance he could play in a regular season game
3855694 theres just such a small window that i wouldnt say its likely but there is definitely a chance
3855695 new analysis suggests that from the end of july 2008 there is only in the atmosphere before we hit a potential point of no return
3855696 prioritise their campaigns based on what will have the biggest environmental impact on a global scale
3855697 you probably have noticed that we are not actively campaigning on this issue the main reason for this is the other organizations that have been set up to deal solely with this issue such as the vegan society www vegsoc org and of course your organization
3855698 researchers at the national institute of livestock and grassland science in japan have carried out a life cycle analysis of beef production which shows that a kilogram of beef leads to the emission of greenhouse gases with a warming potential equivalent of 36 4 kilograms of co2 new scientist 21 7 07 to help you get your head around this thats equivalent to the amount of co2 emitted by the average car over a distance of 250 kilometres
3855699 researchers at the university of chicago have calculated the relative carbon intensity of a standard vegan diet in comparison to a us style carnivorous diet all the way through from production to processing to distribution to cooking and consumption an average burger man that is not the outsize variety emits the equivalent of 1 5 tonnes more co2 every year than the standard vegan by comparison were you to trade in your conventional gas guzzler for a state of the art prius hybrid your co2 savings would amount to little more than one tonne per year
3855700 these were really old things that had been there for quite some time
3855701 is your carbon footprint the size of an ugg boot when it could be a manolo
3855702 you were found guilty of the culpable homicide of your wife who you were together with for many years
3855703 in normal circumstances this would attract a prison sentence in double figures
3855704 sentencing you would just be a token gesture i am anxious to impose a sentence that restricts your liberty you still go to the pub where you went with your wife that must annoy her relatives not being able to go there will be a more meaningful disposal than a prison sentence which will not last long
3855705 you dont walk away from a gift like that you stay grounded and steady in that bond of trust constantly tuned in to the message careful not to be distracted or diverted
3855706 da mesma forma que barack obama mark warner n o tem medo de enfrentar os desafios e reunir as pessoas para encorajar a mudan a a come ar
3855707 rather let our lives lovingly express truth in all things speaking truly dealing truly living truly enfolded in love let us grow up in every way and in all things into him who is the head even christ the messiah the anointed one

3855710 the current enemy did not install the button they just know how to push it
3855711 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3855712 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3855713 the system is putting the money in the hands of the scalpers
3855714 we were three days out of our departure and we had no tickets
3855715 right now weve got a gold medal on our mind
3855716 right now the job is to try to get on the medal stand
3855717 obviously were always thinking about the future the future of the game is very important to everyone
3855718 i just tried to black out the whole thing it was bad
3855719 growing coal use threatens nothing less than the end of civilization as we know it
3855720 vaclav havel never did choose to stand up and pull the stop cord on the train
3855721 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
3855722 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
3855723 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
3855724 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far
3855725 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt and whose background you are beginning to wonder about she has brought real results and even his words today are in doubt invented for a campaign ultimately he cannot win against john mccain
3855726 must now in earnest show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
3855727 does anyone believe it is possible to win the nomination without over these two months raising all these issues against him
3855728 a nice campaign that wins the states alone that can be won will that be enough or do serious issues have to raised about him
3855729 his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited i cannot imagine america electing a president during a time of war who is not at his center fundamentally american in his thinking and in his values
3855730 we are never going to say anything about his background we have to show the value of ours when it comes to making decisions understanding the needs of most americans the invisible americans
3855731 lets explicitly own american in our programs the speeches and the values he doesnt
3855732 make this a new american century the american strategic energy fund lets use our logo to make some flags we can give out lets add flag symbols to the backgrounds
3855733 this is not 1968 and the invasion of czechoslovakia where russia can threaten a neighbor occupy a capital overthrow a government and get away with it
3855734 i have heard the russian president say that his military operations are over i am saying it is time for the russian president to be true to his word
3855735 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3855736 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3855737 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3855738 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
3855739 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
3855740 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
3855741 an earnest desire for some type of achievement or distinction as power honor fame or wealth and the willingness to strive for its attainment
3855742 a mans got to do what a mans got to do
3855743 its not necessary for me to prove anything being here is more than enough
3855744 llevar tiempo y esfuerzo para recuperar la capacidad de los peque os agricultores y no parece que haya ning n deseo pol tico para esto sin olvidar el hecho que nafta debe ser renegociada
3855745 in til buscar un programa de recuperaci n que sea consistente con el pago de la deuda fijada por nuestros acreedores
3855746 nuestros peque os productores agr colas son masacrados por la brutal injusticia del entorno del comercio internacional
3855747 en la globalizaci n el campesino o campesina pierde su identidad social cultural y econ mica de productor ahora un campesino es consumidor de semillas y qu micos caros que venden las poderosas corporaciones trasnacionales por medio de poderosos latifundistas y prestamistas locales
3855748 a menudo lo han hecho en unos t rminos muy desfavorables para los granjeros pobres dejando a estos con m s inseguridad alimentaria y a los gobiernos a depender de unas ayudas internacionales poco predecibles
3855749 muchas de las empresas privadas que vinieron a reemplazar a los investigadores estatales resultaron ser monopolistas en busca de dinero
3855750 no pensamos que el coste humano de esos programas seria tan grande y que las ganancias econ micas tardasen tanto en llegar
3855751 el sector paraestatal continuar a siendo un riesgo para la exitosa implementaci n del presupuesto de 2002 03 las intervenciones del gobierno en la agricultura y otros mercados alimentarios est n socavando otras inversiones m s productivas
3855752 most engineering research deals with the laws of physics so im used to working with truth
3855753 now im working with the laws of bacteria but we dont know what the laws are yet its going to take collaborations between technology types and microbiologists to figure out what these laws are and my students and i want to be at the interface where were doing something that makes a difference
3855754 some of the broad implications of this research are to understand why plasmids persist and disseminate amongst humans and animals
3855755 i tell everyone to use triple acting antibiotic ointment on all their cuts now
3855756 people understand that biotechnology plays an important role in our future in agriculture healthcare the food industry and medicine
3855757 but a lot of people dont understand what biotechnology is
3855758 when we talk about vectors in engineering were referring to a mathematical quantity but in biology a vector refers to a causative carrying agent for example mosquitoes are the vector for malaria
3855759 this certainly helps the pc become a much better center of communications in the home
3855760 corning incorporated and dupont demonstrate an enterprise wide commitment to innovation and are highly successful in the continuous development of profitable new products and businesses
3855761 the practices employed by each of these companies leading to their selection as oci winners will provide significant learning experiences for the new product development community when the recipients share them at the international conference
3855762 the latest developments in hr management are about changing the way hr managers think and the questions they ask

3855764 a great slideshows is determined by the type of interaction a presenter has with their slides
3855765 if the presenter is addicted to reading bullet points then everyone in the room suffers
3855766 we can keep blaming software for the putrid output but in reality we need to take responsibility
3855767 as communicators learning to create visual stories that connect with our audience is becoming imperative especially in light of global competitive pressure
3855768 my most immediate task is to get us in the right financial position to take advantage of the sales pipeline and opportunities ahead
3855769 with strong support from key existing shareholders we believe we are close to securing the additional financing that will provide identiphi the capital for longer term stability and put us on the road toward profitability
3855770 my most immediate task is to get us in the right financial position to take advantage of the sales pipeline and opportunities ahead
3855771 with strong support from key existing shareholders we believe we are close to securing the additional financing that will provide identiphi the capital for longer term stability and put us on the road toward profitability
3855772 ive kind of given that up now and i just play along
3855773 its one of those dreams you have as a child in america
3855774 ive been working for this for the last eight years especially the last four and to time everything right on one day is an accomplishment of its own
3855775 lance lives a life im not at all familiar with
3855776 no movie stars or million dollar bank accounts for me
3855777 i had started having some pain in my hips for a few months but im kind of a self confident person and thought i could diagnose myself
3855778 i would ice my joints and take anti inflammatories and just push through
3855779 my doctor said i needed to stop running and quit doing impact sports and i handled it real well
3855780 i went home and told my husband my life was over my husband is a funny guy too he suggested my life wasnt over i was just going to have to join the real world and get myself a job
3855781 i could win a gold medal and people on the street would still ask me about lance
3855782 but thats ok i dont think he has a gold medal
3855783 we have grown in number to the point where our presence is perceptibly disabling the planet like a disease
3855784 when did you see the good scientific evidence of what everyone knew
3855785 the population of any species talking about we humans is directly related and proportional to the energy use and availability for that species
3855786 when the oil age comes crashing to a close human numbers must and will decrease
3855787 the walls looked like they were moving sometimes there were so many bugs and roaches on the wall when the door first opened roaches fell from the ceiling down to the floor so i knew then we were in for something
3855788 there was garbage packed up to the ceiling the smell was so overwhelming the investigator had to where a gas mask
3855789 it was probably the most disgusting scene that ive ever been involved in as far as human waste and filth and the sad thing about it is you had a wife and four kids who were confined to these four walls and were not permitted to go outside
3855790 from what i understand he just left and didnt come back and she got word somehow i dont know what happened but she got word somehow that he got involved with another lady
3855791 i dont understand why families that have a challenged child who becomes loud and abusive remain at a service where all participants are quiet and contemplative most of the time
3855792 i have known a few people over my lifetime who have had to deal with autism with their children
3855793 its as frustrating for them as it is for the public
3855794 ill tell you what autism is in 99 percent of the cases its a brat who hasnt been told to cut the act out
3855795 some of these stories really are the ones where the general public can absolutely identify with the other side of the story
3855796 i certainly sympathize with all the families who are in this situation
3855797 but when we got away from the concept of institutionalization in america we lost an important element of trying to maintain civility there is a place for mental institutions
3855798 if it were up to me he would be in an institution my brother doesnt agree and thats his prerogative
3855799 im an advocate for my child but we all have to play on the same playground
3855800 its not about clearing the playground so my child can be on it
3855801 were talking 50 to 60 oreos he didnt understand the effect it had on the entire class
3855802 certainly there are cranky people in this world if a mother glares at your child for something thats really pretty harmless quite honestly thats her problem
3855803 but if your child is going to have a meltdown i dont think its in anybodys best interest to bring the child along
3855804 they usually really do care but they have to weigh the considerations of others
3855805 but i would disagree with anybody who thinks they did that casually or it wasnt important to them
3855806 if jesus is supposed to be fully man and fully god and died on the cross then who resurrected him
3855807 my most immediate task is to get us in the right financial position to take advantage of the sales pipeline and opportunities ahead
3855808 with strong support from key existing shareholders we believe we are close to securing the additional financing that will provide identiphi the capital for longer term stability and put us on the road toward profitability
3855809 i think at one point his actions were referred to as thuggery or he was referred to as a thug we take offense to that
3855810 these are young professional people that are very good at what they do and are very sensitive to how theyre portrayed in the public light i was offended by that reference to him hes not a thug hes a young football player whos trying to be at his best who happens to play the game very physically
3855811 we talk about it and we understand that perception all the time is not reality
3855812 this is what we do not who we are we try to keep the lines clear in that regard but sometimes things are written that are hurtful and he smith was hurt by that
3855813 i never mugged anybody or robbed anybody i got a clean record so i dont know how i can be classified as a thug
3855814 youve never heard of anthony smith being in a bar brawl
3855815 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3855816 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie
3855817 really really good i went through a stage when i was in high school when it wasnt so good but now im at a stage where i really appreciate her a lot more
3855818 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby
3855819 sadly the name of lilias trotter is no longer remembered by many people except those 19th century art experts who recall her as the painter who caused art critic john ruskin to rhapsodically change his mind about the ability of women to be artists though all but forgotten now as an artist
3855820 this old leaf shall die and the new leaf shall live
3855821 every known sin shall go if there is a deliverance to be had i will have it
3855822 the death he died he died to sin once for all but the life he lives he lives to god in the same way count yourselves dead to sin but alive to god in christ jesus
3855823 look at it this way so she is let go today then she ends up getting an amazing job some where else that really enriches her life you would want that for her right well thats what its all about right now waiting to see what happens its a journey my dear one that we have no control over yeah its a major inconvenience at first worry about paying some bills and such but after that its an adventure where she goes from here well she has a new exciting path to explore
3855824 the brain is plastic and with relatively light injury like this the functions remap within a week or two
3855825 it could come back but i wouldnt bet on it
3855826 weve been following oil and gas development in the amazon since 2004 and the picture has changed before our eyes
3855827 when you look at where the oil and gas blocks are they overlap perfectly on top of the peak biodiversity spots almost as if by design and this is in one of the most if not the most biodiverse place on earth
3855828 the real concern is when exploration is successful and a zone moves into the development phase because thats when the roads drilling and pipelines come in
3855829 theyre not looking at the bigger picture of what happens if there are lots of projects going on at the same time
3855830 you could have each individual company thinking theyre being relatively responsible and keeping their own road networks under control and so on but what happens when you have 15 other projects around you all of a sudden when you look at the bigger picture you have a sprawling road network
3855831 the way that oil development is being pursued in the western amazon is a gross violation of the rights of the indigenous peoples of the region
3855832 international agreements and inter american human rights law recognise indigenous peoples have rights to their lands and explicitly prohibit the granting of concessions to exploit natural resources in their territories without their free prior and informed consent
3855833 you know the truth is that right after 9 11 i had a pin
3855834 shortly after 9 11 particularly because as were talking about the iraq war that became a substitute for i think true patriotism which is speaking out on issues that are of importance to our national security i decided i wont wear that pin on my chest link
3855835 the north american jet that flew obama and his traveling crew around for much of the primary season was refurbished with new seats and power for each passenger a must on the campaign trail and the plane that once had an american flag on its tail now sports the obama o
3855836 we are kidding ourselves if we think we can drill our way out of these problems
3855837 i think that i would have preferred a gradual adjustment the fact that this is such a shock to american pocketbooks is not a good thing
3855838 if we take some steps right now to help people make the adjustment first of all by putting more money into their pockets but also by encouraging the market to adapt to these new circumstances more quickly particularly u
3855839 were not happy we werent selected but we rarely protest
3855840 its only when we see something untoward or that a committee missed something
3855841 he was two hours late cut his show short didnt once acknowlegde the crowd that waited two hours on an already late show not even a wave goodbye im no longer a kanye fan huge disappointment
3855842 its not the stage hands fault that stage was set up for well over an hour before kanye decided to grace us with his presence
3855843 the next time he holds that finger up and proclaims himself as 1 i hope someone tells him what he can do with that finger
3855844 as americans pay almost 90 percent more to fill their gas tanks since president bush took office oil companies continue to reap gigantic profits and oil executives receive astronomical compensation
3855845 the republican rubber stamp congress has passed two energy bills costing taxpayers 12 billion for giveaways to big oil companies
3855846 democrats have a plan to lower gas prices taking america in a new direction that works for everyone not just the few our plan would empower the federal trade commission to crack down on price gouging to help bring down skyrocketing gas prices increase production of alternative fuels and rescind the billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies tax breaks and royalty relief given to big oil and gas companies
3855847 if they have a difference with me on policy they should debate me not her
3855848 i can no more disown michelle as i can disown the black community
3855849 for the first time in my adult life i am proud of my country
3855850 barack is one of the smartest people you will ever encounter who will deign to enter this messy thing called politics
3855851 i had been waiting for this moment for a long time im thrilled
3855852 im much more moved today than on the day of my serie a debut
3855853 life in italy is much harder for a foreigner than for an italian
3855854 i could give you many examples like when youre forced to stand in endless queues to get into the offices of the police headquarters
3855855 i did it once with my mother and once was enough for me she has done it tens of times for me
3855856 its not a nice thing knowing that i was born in italy and had never lived outside italy but this is certainly one of the minor inconveniences
3855857 inter are very strong this year im expecting to have a season like last year and besides the league i also hope to win both the coppa italia and the champions league
3855858 the ballon dor is every players top target together with the world cup
3855859 a call up for italy would be the best birthday present i could receive
3855860 one of the reasons people cling to their hates so stubbornly is because they sense once hate is gone they will be forced to deal with pain
3855861 that was special but it was also strange because shes sister jamie lynn always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby it was mind boggling i was shocked a little bit but it was really cool
3855862 i stay away from the tabloids im not going to talk about lindsay because shes my friend you know shes great shes also 22 years old i think people forget that with the internet the way it is one second were enemies one second were best friends one second were lovers and then were broken up
3855863 it was there during the ceremony when we saw other people doing stuff and i thought well lets one up everybody
3855864 and i gave him a little body language so he knew what i was about to do so i didnt knock the president on his rear
3855865 office connector really ramped up our adoption of the wiki across the company
3855866 those not familiar with wiki editing now have a much simpler way to publish and edit the wiki through microsoft office
3855867 the new search capabilities are a major bonus to users all around search is easier faster and more intuitive
3855868 weve also made improvements to some of our most popular macros galleries and charts in addition there s a new pagetree macro designed to make documentation management much easier
3855869 this represents not only the best integration with microsoft office of any enterprise wiki application but also a very smooth experience across both microsoft and atlassian products
3855870 hh hh also eigtl bin ich ja nur dummer azubi oh da sind wir schon dann mal sch nen tag noch und viel spass
3855871 last i checked there is nothing in the canon of scriptures that i am aware of that requires a ward to do these sort of things over the hill is a wendys that i am sure is happy to take your money in exchange for food that you can complain about there when the food and entertainment is free you have two choices 1 enjoy it for what it is or 2 shut up
3855872 this is a legitimate question to be asking in light of the fact that he is apparently renting from someone with an interest in his official actions as a senator
3855873 it would be one thing if he was paying above market value and they could argue that it is included in his rent but he is paying below market for this apartment at a minimum not paying utilities would be a violation of the congressional gift ban certainly under no way is it okay for a member of congress to be taking free or subsidized rent or benefits from anyone particularly from someone you are working with
3855874 es una campa a para ayudar a los ni os del hospital garrahan entramos en internet en una oportunidad y vimos que la fundaci n garrahan recibe las tapitas y las vende como materia prima a una f brica la recolecci n no tiene l mites es una cosa que permanentemente se puede hacer en realidad es una hermosa actividad porque con tan poco esfuerzo uno recoge basura recicla y hace una obra de bien de acuerdo a la informaci n de internet 600 tapitas equivale a una di lisis y 5 000 a una quimioterapia
3855875 la idea es juntar en la capilla de f tima en la bajada vieja porque lo que podemos juntar en cada casa es poco pero con un poco en cada lado se puede hacer mucho ahora ya juntamos 10 000 tapitas y empezamos a mandar esta semana las tapitas tienen que ser las de cualquier gaseosa y de agua mineral nosotros tenemos una urna en la capilla de f tima y entre toda la comunidad afrontaremos los gastos del traslado del flete
3855876 la fundaci n garrahan tambi n tienen un programa de reciclado de papel pero nosotros desistimos de ese programa porque el papel pesa mucho y los gastos saldr an m s caros y no lo bamos a poder enfrentar
3855877 y ese mucho es una obra de saneamiento al ambiente de limpieza de la ciudad y una obra de caridad caminando por la costanera recojo 30 tapitas en una hora alguna ventaja ten amos que sacar de la mala costumbre de tirar la basura
3855878 la verdad que no se nos ocurri porque nos esta superando la cantidad de gente que colabora el colegio san basilio tambi n se sumo y as distintos lugares y no damos abasto a recoger las tapitas una de las profesoras de ese colegio teresita con sus alumnos ya recogieron 1 000 tapitas
3855879 i love the blogs name its also an appropriate moniker for middle age cyclists who i suspect use that third chainring occasionally
3855880 i really like your blog going to have to add it to my daily websites
3855881 it covers a wide spectrum of cycling issues european and domestic racing as well as some of the history and tradition of the sport very well written and presented
3855882 lately ive been enjoying the collaborative cycling blog run in part by former chicagoan leonard basobas as someone who admittedly doesnt follow the nrc much except for when its racing nearby this fans point of view is useful for staying abreast of the various personalities and storylines

3855915 when i came on they asked do you want him in the movie and i was like of course not to include him in the movie would have been sacrilege i had to have isaac in the film
3855916 when i went to shake his hand and tell him how much i loved him and what a great job he did he hugged me back and looked me in the eye and said make a great film man

3855930 if we can show that we can burn helium 3 it is a much cleaner and safer energy source than other nuclear fuels
3855931 i dont think that the main motivation to go back to the moon is helium 3
3855932 but over the long term we do face an energy problem
3855933 this reduces radiation issues and also greatly simplifies the engineering
3855934 helium 3 is present on the moon but in very small concentration levels meaning that many hundreds of millions of tons of soil must be processed to extract a ton of helium 3
3855935 our real challenge is not obtaining the helium 3 it is demonstrating that we can burn it
3855936 one should never say never it may come to pass that helium 3 could become an important source of energy in the coming century
3855937 that time has not come yet and i suspect that it is still some time off

3856007 robert talks a good game but at last nights debate he made the amazingly revealing statement that he was in total support of the illegal confrontational city hall budget action taken by mayor wilder that has created an unprecedented budget situation in richmond

3856019 there can be little surprise therefore that russia responded to this unprovoked assault on its citizens by launching a military incursion into south ossetia
3856020 ostensibly this war is about an unresolved separatist conflict yet in reality it is a war about the independence and the future of georgia
3856021 the invasion was clearly timed to take the russians by surprise
3856022 peaceful and lasting resolution to the situation in the region
3856023 the region of south ossetia which has enjoyed de facto independence for more than 16 years
3856024 the plucky republic of georgia with just a few million citizens was attacked by its giant eastern neighbour russia

3856027 this was an incredibly fast turnaround to provide this solution something we never could have obtained this fast from industry
3856028 we had the right people at the right time to develop a great solution
3856029 we established goals for the round by looking at the test targets and working backwards we recognized the critical need for our solution to work and our team just clicked
3856030 we were lucky to have everything locally we needed to produce this solution the customer developer and test capability are all here on the emerald coast
3856031 this round will enable ac 130 crews to train effectively with the armor piercing round and conserve available quantities of scarce and expensive high explosive incendiary ammunition for combat use

3856040 this is a historic day for the town of florida and for verizon
3856041 we are proud to be able to bring the benefits of broadband internet service to consumers in florida today and soon to thousands more consumers in western massachusetts
3856042 verizons investments in massachusetts have and will continue to be a major contributor to growing the states economy
3856043 after years of working toward this goal it is good to see that the residents of florida and many other unserved towns in the north berkshire franklin county communities will be able to get online
3856044 i look forward to working with verizon to roll out broadband in all of our communities
3856045 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement

3856050 ini yang mesti dipahami semua pihak bahwa tunjangan profesi tidak serta merta diperoleh guru ketika mereka lulus sertifikasi masih ada dua syarat lain yang harus dipenuhi yakni mendapat nomor induk registrasi guru bersertifikat dan sudah menjalani 24 jam tatap muka dengan murid selama seminggu
3856051 berbeda misalnya dengan kabupaten kabupaten atau kecamatan kecamatan yang jumlah gurunya tidak terlalu banyak mereka dengan mudah memenuhi syarat tersebut kalau guru di kota besar kan harus berebut juga dengan guru guru yang lainnya
3856052 kondisi ini yang membuat kami kadang dituduh berlama lama memegang dana tunjangan profesi padahal kami siap memberikan tunjangan tersebut kapan pun sejauh guru guru tersebut memenuhi syarat mendapatkannya kami tak berani menahan dana tunjangan profesi karena ini sepenuhnya milik guru guru bersertifikat

3856059 there is no reason that soldiers reporting for duty should have to pay out of their pocket for the cost of transporting the equipment they are required to bring
3856060 when travelling to training or a war zone the last thing these brave men and women should have to worry about is unanticipated expenses and bureaucratic forms i call on secretary gates to initiate a plan that will ensure our troops do not have to pay excess luggage fees while reporting for training or deployment given the outrage over recent reports of soldiers being burdened like this it is my hope the department will promptly respond to my request
3856061 because the soldiers dont pay a dime our waiver of the fees amounts to a discount to the military not a discount to soldiers soldiers should not have to pay a penny of it

3856075 there is a snowstorm today monday evening but the team is hoping to get a couple of clear days to go up to c2 or c3 before the weather forecasts predict more unsettled weather
3856076 they are looking for a minimum of 3 days of good weather in order to make a summit attempt
3856077 they are still planning to take their own o2 up the mountain to ensure they have an adequate supply although it is rumoured that oxygen tanks were left on the mountain
3856078 there was a lot of equipment left on the mountain as many teams left in a hurry after the accident
3856079 the entire norit k2 expedition team is very much affected by the dramatic developments and the tragic loss of their team member
3856080 after extensive meetings with the relatives of mcdonnell in pakistan the team is now willing to share their personal experiences and answer questions during a press conference in dutch language
3856081 after the successful summit on august 1st expedition leader wilco van rooijen cas van de gevel the nepalese pemba gyalje sherpa and the irish gerard mcdonnell the team faced serious troubles together with at least 15 climbers while descending from the top
3856082 unfortunately 11 mountaineers died including gerard mcdonnell van rooijen and van de gevel are suffering serious frostbite but are in relatively good shape given the severe circumstances
3856083 given their late arrival there will be no opportunity for individual interviews after the press conference personal interviews can be scheduled as from next week after the team returns from the memorial services for the late mc donnell which will take place this weekend in ireland
3856084 on august 5th only 3 days after arriving in islamabad we trekked into herligkoffer base camp which was the same launching spot as humar had for the rupal face
3856085 our cook staff said it was only a half hour easy glacier crossing to reach the start of the messner our intended acclimatisation route 7 hours of trying later we realised that the glacier crossing was not possible without a ladder or 2 and a lot of fixed rope constant rain has changed the glacier significantly we called for extra porters this evening as we must move our base camp further south about 4 to 5 hours away to another grassy meadow
3856086 this was such a road these were such gold splashed peaks
3856087 there were a number of candidates to sing that song and at the end of the day the artistic directors picked the best voice and the best performer

3856089 the counterfeit games designed to look good from every angle
3856090 bring some sanity and proportion back to both the opening ceremony and the games themselves
3856091 our president may have gone there just to watch the games the chinese leadership does not take that view
3856092 they want to send a message the message of flawless execution
3856093 shows once again how political the sponsorship of the olympics is for the chinese
3856094 this is pretty unfair for the girl who was not picked to perform live
3856095 this girl has a great voice and they should recognize that she deserves to be seen she should definitely perform at the closing ceremonies
3856096 if your son is playing on a football team suddenly the coach may decide that hes not playing hes going to stay on the bench
3856097 the right information has to be given to the people
3856098 last year we finished towards the bottom in the nation in passing thank god for rashard mendenhall he would carry this team a lot last year but now hes gone
3856099 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3856100 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3856101 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3856102 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3856103 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3856104 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3856105 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

3856107 the unprecedented brutality unleashed by indian paramiltary troops on unarmed kashmiri protestors marching towards muzaffarabad defies all logic
3856108 i wonder whether the murderers of these thirty protestors will ever see the justice or will they be treated as heroes as all other previous indian paramilitary personnel have been for similar crimes in the past
3856109 i heartily pass condolences to those persons who have lost their lives in the recent agitations all over the kashmir i am from west bengal and this type of act should be actively restricted i and all my fellow friends from west bengal love the land of god the people of kashmir and their tradition
3856110 i sincerely regret whatever happened in the valley yesterday if i could maybe i would want to erase the entire day from history
3856111 just logged online to see what the world had been writing about the situation in kashmir the civil curfew is so strict that we cant even step outside our houses to breathe the fresh air of the valley leave aside the daring task of buying very few local newspapers with an unheard side of kashmirs story
3856112 he sees only what the media wishes him to see an ordinary patriotic indian who thinks that kashmiris are some religious fanatics seeking independence from india without any explainable reasons or maybe some other fellow indians putting the situation in kashmir as a work of some separatist kashmiri leaders misleading the otherwise innocent and peace loving people of kashmir
3856113 when the media fails its the responsibility of the ordinary people to find out the actual truth hiding beneath the superficial truths
3856114 i had to deal with it on my way up now im dumping it all on you
3856115 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3856116 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3856117 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems

3856122 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3856123 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3856124 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3856125 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3856150 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
3856151 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
3856152 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
3856153 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
3856154 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country

3856228 leuke idee n voor mn eigen inrichting was de nieuwe ikea gids niet onlangs uit de kamers in dat paleis waren nogal somber donker met veel bruin en rood dat de bewoners er niet depri van werden vooral in een tijd dat de belichting kaarslicht nogal schamel was verder moet het er niet al te fris hebben geroken de mensen waren een paar eeuwen terug niet zo schoon op hun lichaam ik zag ook nergens een badgelegenheid of een toilet of moesten ze eerst het hele paleis door om te kunnen toiletteren
3856229 als je zo door zon paleis wandel krijg je wel een beetje de indruk dat die prinsen en prinsessen vroeger in een geheel andere wereld leefden dan de gewone burger een grote tuin tot de beschikking afgeschermd van de grote boze buitenwereld de tegenwoordige royals begeven zich toch meer tussen het gewone volk de prinsen huwen met burger meisjes
3856230 armoede heeft nu een andere betekenis meer op sociaal vlak dan materieel
3856231 maar dat vond ik gewoon een leuk plaatje van een jonge vrouw in een romantische witte jurk
3856232 in het begin toen zij pas het vaandel van paul rosenm ller had overgenomen was ik niet zo van haar onder de indruk maar in de loop der jaren heeft zij zich ontwikkeld tot een goed debater en daar gaat het in de politiek toch om dat je anderen weet te overtuigen zodat men op jou voorstel gaat stemmen of omgekeerd dat de leden van de 2e kamer tegen een bepaald idee stemmen door jou overtuigende argumenten
3856233 is het je trouwens ook opgevallen dat alleen de partij voor de dieren en groen links een vrouw als lijsttrekker hebben tja die politiek blijft toch een mannenwereld
3856234 al dat hanige gedrag van die mannen in die debatten gaat toch ook vervelen wouter bos maakt in een poging serieus over te komen een chagrijnige indruk en balkenende spreekt niet eens behoorlijk engels het gaat nu wat beter hij heeft zeker uitspraakles gehad maar in het begin het leek wel steenkool engels daar kun je als premier van een land toch niet mee voor de dag komen en dat voor een hoog opgeleide
3856235 en komt het niet door de leiding van jan peter dat we nu al voor een derde keer naar de stembus moeten
3856236 ik zie niet in waarom ik mijn stem zou geven aan iemand die zich nooit om mij bekommerd heeft laat staan dat ie politiek iets voor mij zou kunnen betekenen alleen maar om diens ego te strelen mijn stem hebben ze ook niet nodig gehad ook zonder mijn steun is de overwinning behaald ze hebben dus niet te klagen
3856237 op de sp en die hebben ook niet slecht geboerd of ze er uiteindelijk wat van bakken moeten we nog afwachten in ieder geval waait er weer een frisse wind door die gemeenteraad
3856238 nee ik heb wel eens zon vergadering bijgewoond en vond het supersaai al dat geneuzel over kleine onderwerpjes en besluiten voor de politiek moet je toch bepaalde kwaliteiten hebben ik denk dat dat familielid van mij wel kwaliteiten heeft en kennis van zaken maar mijn sympathie heeft hij zeker niet en daarom heb ik er niet op gestemd
3856239 maar ik deed deze cursus alleen omdat ik creatief bezig wilde zijn en niet om later in een atelier productiewerk te gaan doen
3856240 het was een minuscuul advertentietje waarin een kledingatelier meisjes zocht ervaring niet vereist stond erbij
3856241 nee want de naam van het bedrijf kwam me bekend voor ze maakte er kleding voor grote maten en waren al eens op tv geweest zo wist ik dat het zuivere koffie was
3856242 de eigelijke leidinggeefster was overspannen of zo en zat ziek thuis
3856243 het was er anders dan in een gewoon atelier per dag waren er 4 of 5 meiden aanwezig je hoefde je niet te haasten om een kledingstuk af te krijgen in je eigen tempo werkte een deelneemster aan een broek jurk blouse of jack je zat niet de hele dag kragen te stikken of alleen knopen aan te zetten de werksfeer was dus ontspannen en niet gehaast door deze praktijk ervaring leerde ik sneller te werken dan op de cursus
3856244 die andere gasten waren niet erg spraakzaam men wachtte braaf af op het volgende testje praatje op een gegeven moment zat ik achter een bureau waar een computer stond h ik kan wel even gaan internetten zeg ik zo gekscherend maar men reageerde niet echt daarop
3856245 wat dat inhield kon ik op het internet niet vinden maar ik beschouw het eigenlijk als een belediging het lijkt er veel op dat deze onderzoekers maar een label op je plakken om je in een bepaald hokje te kunnen stoppen
3856246 ik vind het gewoon quasi interessant gebral doet me sterk denken aan een psychisch rapport dat n van mijn zusters ooit over mij geschreven heeft in gewone mensentaal kan men ook zeggen heeft lichte lichamelijke klachten ten gevolge van overgewicht waar de p699 voor staat is mij niet bekend
3856247 door deze oogafwijking lijkt het soms of ik langs de mensen heen kijk
3856248 dit gebeurde slechts een enkele keer maar zoals het in dit rapport staat lijkt het alsof ik geheel niet luisterde naar de instructies
3856249 vooroordelerig en vol van de spiegelogische prietpraat volkomen overbodig en niets toevoegend waarom noemt men mij geen anarchist dat begint ook met een a eigenlijk is dit hele onderzoek tijd en geldverspilling maar ja we leven in een rijk land dus is er geld voor allerlei flauwekul geef dat geld beter direct aan mij kan ik er een leuke new age achtige ontdek je eigen creativiteit onzin cursus voor volgen ergens in de franse alpen
3856250 de letters van het geschrevene waren tamelijk groot dus leest zoiets snel
3856251 ter vergelijking heb ik een 4 tal van die andere bn glossys doorgekeken heleen vind ik niks al dat geneuzel van haar over seks en dat lekker stout gedoe infantiele spelletjes van zogenaamde volwassenen van de satcg zijn het buh niks an dan de linda hierin voornamelijk reclames van chique producten voor mensen met hetzelfde budget als maxima ik behoor dus niet echt tot de doelgroep overigens kon ik nauwelijks het verschil zien tussen wat nu een reclame was en wat een item fotoreportage lekker verwarrend vandaar dat het blad ondanks de dikte niet al te veel kost het is gewoon een vette reclame folder dan heb je nog de catherine kennelijk gericht op de rijpere vrouw naast een paar interviews wordt ook dit blad voornamelijk gevuld met subtiele reclames in de vorm van stijltips mode en make up het enige blad wat ik wel aardig vond was de felderhof hierin meer geschreven items en interviews de reclames zijn niet al te storend aanwezig gericht op mensen met een bewustere levensstijl verschijnt ook maar 4 keer per jaar

3856257 since i was a teenager ive been involved in anti fascist campaigning so ive put up with day to day political jibes ive been on marches and had things shouted at me but never anything as serious as this

3856266 i should love to have everybody taught about evolution from a fairly early age because it is so important so exciting it answers so many questions and mysteries it solves so many problems until you know about it youre wandering around on this earth looking at trees and birds and flowers not knowing why any of them is there evolution is the answer to that riddle so youre not really a whole person if you dont know where you come from and why you exist and its not difficult its not like relativity its not like quantum theory its something teachable to fairly young children

3856391 i always say you could publish rules in a newspaper and no one would follow them the key is consistency and discipline
3856392 personally i have known the zimbabwean leadership for a long time
3856393 even if it means spending six months in zimbabwe then we will do it as long as it will bring an end to the challenges that the country is experiencing
3856394 let us give the zimbabwean leaders breathing space to resolve their differences
3856395 and in the days ahead we will use u s aircraft as well as naval forces to deliver humanitarian and medical supplies
3856396 russia has also stated that it has halted military operations and agreed to a provisional cease fire
3856397 unfortunately were receiving reports of russian actions that are inconsistent with these statements
3856398 we expect russia to meet its commitment to cease all military activities in georgia and we expect all russian forces who have entered georgia in recent days to withdraw from that country
3856399 were concerned about reports that georgian citizens of all ethnic origins are not being protected
3856400 all forces including russian forces have an obligation to protect innocent civilians from attack
3856401 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3856402 the us has for several years now mishandled the situation in georgia
3856403 the way that mikheil saakashvili has approached this has been by thinking that he could be an extension of the west a partner of the united states
3856404 in many ways we have given him cause for thinking that with the many visits to the united states the talk of georgia as a beacon for democracy
3856405 i think in many respects saakashvili got too close to the united states and the united states got too close to saakashvili
3856406 it made him overreach it made him feel at the end of the day that the west would come to his assistance if he got into trouble
3856407 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3856408 underlying all this is a larger more significant contest a geopolitical struggle between russia and the west over the export of caspian sea oil and natural gas
3856409 the united states seeks to use georgia as an energy corridor to transport caspian energy to the west without going through iran or russia to this end it helped build the btc pipeline across georgia and helped beef up the georgian military to protect it
3856410 by declaring the caucasus a region that is thousands of miles from the american continent a sphere of its national interest the united states made a serious blunder
3856411 the kremlin made abundantly clear that it would view kosovos independence without serbian consent and a un security council mandate as a precedent for the two georgian de facto independent enclaves
3856412 you have heard the statement by the u s president that the united states is starting a military humanitarian operation in georgia
3856413 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
3856414 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3856415 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3856416 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3856417 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3856418 were doing our best to keep up with them and to best understand the situation its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3856419 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3856420 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3856421 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3856422 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3856423 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react
3856424 the path of freedom you have chosen is not easy but you will not travel it alone
3856425 my intent in the future is to make it so there is no such thing as a refusal you can refuse all you want but we are going to aggressively seek search warrants
3856426 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3856427 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3856428 lets make no mistake about this a deal that does not involve opposition leader morgan tsvangirai the man who won the free and fair election in march is null and void and it seems the old man president robert mugabe is just not ready to hand over power to those that have legitimacy
3856429 we are moving in circles and that makes me sick very frustrated
3856430 there has been a disagreement with one element of the talks which has to do with an agreement with power sharing morgan tsvangirai asked for time out in order to reflect on this matter so that we reconvene them later
3856431 just like in the run off where mugabe contested alone this empty deal is in all essence a zanu pf agreement
3856432 mutambara did not run in the presidential elections and is just too happy to have some relevance in zimbabwean politics
3856433 all my hopes of returning to a normal life in the near future have been dashed by mugabes unwillingness to relinquish power
3856434 prices keep going up as our pockets shrivel there is no electricity no water and unemployment will rise even further as industries close all because of an obsession with power an obsession that benefits a few people at the expense of the majority
3856435 many in formal employment thought that an internationally accepted deal would bring back the spark to their jobs but there seems to be no light at the end of the tunnel
3856436 i am convinced that mugabe is living in perpetual fear and the brave face that we see on television masks a man who is in a deep quandary
3856437 even if he mugabe wanted to give tsvangirai some executive powers there are many powerful people within his party who would lose out and these people seem to be pressuring him to deny the mdc leader what rightfully belongs to him and to the people
3856438 after parliamentary elections the opposition won more seats than zanu pf and that was good since it reversed the then ruling partys ability to make decisions based on its majority in parliament
3856439 however with the stance taken by mutambara the opposition is now divided there are some in the opposition who would grab any chance to be in positions of power and i am afraid that mugabe might announce a cabinet that includes members from tsvangirais party a development that could further weaken his party if some of those members decide to accept what is offered
3856440 since january everyone has been talking about elections and nothing has been moving we have gone for too long without a parliament
3856441 and who is tsvangirai to think that he can hold us to ransom after all he is nothing but the mouthpiece of britain and the united states and is responsible for all the suffering we are experiencing today
3856442 legitimate leader of zimbabwe because he won the 27 june run off and led the war against imperialism while he spends sleepless nights trying to find ways of totally empowering the people of this country
3856443 the political leaders acknowledge that none of them on their own with their political parties have the capacity to solve these problems and so they have to work together
3856444 tsvangirai was not happy that he would have presided over a few social and economic ministries while mugabe retained executive powers as executive president while security ministries would have fallen directly under the control of mugabe
3856445 no the talks have not collapsed they can never collapse as long as we have tongues for talking
3856446 shes going to come out here for the kids birthdays
3856447 it will be the first time the cousins meet im sure the boys will be like big brothers to maddie

3856449 that was special but it was also strange because shes always been the baby and now the baby was having a baby

3856451 because i knew if they had those it would be harder to go back
3856452 you will regret the day you have given up control
3856453 early childhood and elementary teachers are often left out of science professional development offered by colleges and universities when in fact research supports the importance of this age in developing lifelong positive dispositions toward science and nature
3856454 we are excited that we will be able to impact and empower 25 more teachers this coming year
3856455 our summer courses for professional educators have attracted teachers from throughout northeast ohio to hirams campus for intensive workshops across many disciplines science in the schoolyard was among our most popular last year thanks in part to support from the board of regents
3856456 the trip is going fabulously well much better than i could have ever hoped for these students are so fortunate in each location we have seen things that i have never seen in 30 some years of being a biologist it just gets better and better

3856525 no one is in a jam more than leah daughtry the religious point person for the democrats and ceo of the convention
3856526 to begin with the democratic convention is not starting with a religious service it is being held on august 24 the day before the convention begins

3856529 utopian fantasy that gun control laws will somehow make neighborhoods safer
3856530 while promising to preserve our second amendment rights the party platform demonizes semiautomatic sport utility rifles and wants them banned calls for anti gun show legislation and proposes so called common sense gun laws
3856531 boiled down all it really means is that the democrats are still the party of gun control no matter how they try to re package the rhetoric
3856532 shamelessly telling american gun owners that they embrace the rights of millions of shooters hunters and gun collectors
3856533 as democrats descend on denver to nominate a candidate who is on record in opposition to sensible concealed carry laws we encourage gun owners across the country and especially in colorado to remind the party that the supreme court in june held that gun bans are unconstitutional

3856558 somehow we felt that as long as there is mahmoud darwish there is a sense of goodness a sense of hope a sense of possibility for salvation
3856559 he left a legacy of poetry behind him he is immortal in our hearts
3856560 darwish has managed to break many of the taboos between the occupier and the people who resist the occupation
3856561 darwish was palestine personified in a man a man full of love nationalism and passion

3856617 im also told that its not the majority reason the majority of the off take is coming from increased demand in expanding economies around the world and their consumption of meat corn is the main ingredient that goes into that product so for a multitude of reasons demand for corn globally and ethanol is part of that is up

3856739 we have seen first hand how asbestos has wreaked havoc on americans working in naval shipyards automobile plants and the construction industry most often this is through their employers conscious choice for profits over a workers health
3856740 now we all have clarity about the nasty nature of putins russia
3856741 its all of the above time gang domestic drilling nukes concentrated solar deep geothermal clean coal and whatever else silicon valley and heroic capitalists everywhere can dream up as we conduct a market driven transition to a post hydrocarbon economy

3856744 after they phone their doctor she promised me i will be the next call

3856755 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3856756 were aware of it were helping the state police right now
3856757 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3856758 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3856759 they had a wonderful summer together and have moved on with their lives
3856760 since i was a teenager ive been involved in anti fascist campaigning so ive put up with day to day political jibes ive been on marches and had things shouted at me but never anything as serious as this
3856761 ive obviously had to take it very seriously because of my family they said they were going to shoot me and have identified what gun theyre going to use so it shows they know what theyre talking about for people who know redwatch when they do identify you you usually become a victim of violence
3856762 we are investigating a threat to kill recently made on a website
3856763 we are following a number of inquiries and working closely with the victim to trace the person or people responsible if anyone has any information about the threat please contact us on 856 9255
3856764 weve been getting calls from neighbors and people driving by theres a dog trapped on the island
3856765 the geese are very wary of them then eventually they figure it out
3856766 theyre very striking when you first come upon them i could see how it would be for someone driving by at 70 miles per hour
3856767 they dont seem to be doing any good anymore and it appears they are upsetting some people
3856768 were very pleased to partner with econo foods for this promotion
3856769 it has been very successful and a great benefit to both the community and to our teams we look forward to a continuing relationship with econo
3856770 mi sono proprio rotto le scatole e adesso le prendi
3856771 zo groot is dat je er even goed een sjaal mee kan breien of een vermomming voor de komende halloween
3856772 i think were definitely on the right track as a team
3856773 of course ken lucas played a big part in that
3856774 guys are still working and still battling and i think that is a great sign
3856775 like always there are always tougher times than others but i think we worked through everything pretty well i like this group so far
3856776 no child should have to go though something like this they are playing with toys they shouldnt be harmed because of it
3856777 there was no way i was going to buy my children a toy again
3856778 this bill represents the most significant improvements to product safety since congress created the cpsc in the 1970s
3856779 congress responded to the wishes of parents and children all across america and passed legislation that will help restore our confidence in the safety of our toys and everyday products
3856780 god has blessed us with our son being ok and now gave me a tool to say we need to have this stopped
3856781 its not ok for lead to be in childrens toys
3856782 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
3856783 i virtually had no hope of ever knowing what happened to my dad
3856784 i wouldnt say ive processed it i think im still a little shell shocked by it all
3856785 i think they kind of grasp what is going on
3856786 i dont know that the military even looked for him
3856787 i guess they figured he was gone and thats about it
3856788 im just so proud of him and what he did for his country
3856789 anything i can do to see he gets the honors he deserves thats what im working for
3856790 its never finalized until the board approves it kelley said

3856793 basically all federal money is in jeopardy they dont mess around
3856794 wed have to find a parking spot close because thats hard on us older folks to walk far
3856795 its a little bit better for us to ride than to walk
3856796 why should taxpayers subsidize for profit organizations like professional sports teams that can well afford to pay for shuttle services
3856797 transit agencies have historically charged less than market rates for its charter services because of the federal subsidy and usually another subsidy from the event sponsor this has put transit agencies in direct competition with private charter operators for these services and transit agencies always win because public subsidized transit agency rates are lower
3856798 if anything this is going to be a win win for game day ridership because you have true market competition delivering the bus service at the best price
3856799 the system that theyve set up now what weve seen is it allows a very small distinct portion of the private operators to really skew the industry
3856800 what were being told by this regulation is we cant do it anymore
3856801 weve got to turn it over what were trying to do is make sure its turned over in as effective a manner as we can would we like to be able to continue to do it absolutely
3856802 i dont want to beat a dead horse here but i think its going to be very difficult for them to have to make a profit and charge a reasonable price
3856803 it is also equally important for universities to continuously improve their standards to gain international respect
3856804 we are so proud to have been selected to be a major part of such an exciting and positive campaign
3856805 no one has ever seen this level of performance technology fused with both contemporary and classic mens footwear styles
3856806 i think when the public sees their favorite stars wearing these very unique and recognizable shoes on all of the major red carpet events in the coming year it will create some serious buzz about both the cause and this brand

3856812 our opinion is that its still a restless volcano and it would not be a big surprise if we saw some more activity out at kasatochi

3856822 a name to keep an eye on is linebacker jonathan willard willard may be exceeding expectations more than anyone he would certainly still benefit from a redshirt but the tigers might not have that luxury at middle linebacker they have brandon maye an unproven redshirt freshman and behind maye is senior josh miller a career backup a few others are being cross trained at mike but it could be argued they are one injury away from needing to have willard ready to play
3856823 the fourth year player from conway made a couple of nice moves on a 25 yard touchdown pass from stephen garcia on saturday though he also dropped a pass steve spurrier said he needs to get wallace more touches

3856837 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analyzed clearly
3856838 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3856839 the mere suspicion of possible hostilities should not be enough to justify overwhelming deadly force

3856880 the decision to authorise the shot was reasonable given the circumstances of the incident
3856881 the facts show that the incident occurred against the backdrop of severe hostilities in the area earlier in the day three idf israeli army soldiers had been killed in an attack
3856882 only in retrospect was it discovered that the suspicious figures were reuters cameramen wearing vests and that the object mounted on a tripod was a camera and not an anti tank missile or a tripod mounted mortar
3856883 im extremely disappointed that this report condones a disproportionate use of deadly force in a situation the army itself admitted had not been analysed clearly
3856884 they would appear to take the view that any raising of a camera into position could garner a deadly response
3856885 the latest in a long line of cases clearing soldiers of deadly negligence
3856886 la predisposici n del jugador y sus agentes por quedarse
3856887 papel relevante del presidente para que el futbolista continuara aqu
3856888 los jugadores echamos ra ces y aqu silva se siente importante a pesar de las posibilidades que pueda tener quiere seguir con nosotros y queremos agradec rselo
3856889 el club ha llegado hasta donde ha podido y el jugador ha bajado tambi n hasta donde consideraba necesario
3856890 el valencia tiene muy claro que tipo de gesti n quiere llevar a cabo y no va acometer locuras ni se va a salir de las l neas generales para la estructura econ mica y deportiva actual ni para el futuro
3856891 si silva hubiera salido del valencia hubiera tenido donde elegir
3856892 las dos partes quer an llegar a un acuerdo y al final se ha producido de manera satisfactoria
3856893 tanto el jugador como nosotros quer amos que siguiera muchos a os defendiendo al valencia y al final hemos llegado a un acuerdo que se preve a por las intenciones de ambas parte
3856894 lo que nos deja a todos muy contentos a todos es anunciar que el acuerdo es total para el jugador ha sido una decisi n muy importante y hay que recalcar el esfuerzo del valencia por mantener en su plantilla a un jugador como silva
3856895 no hemos trasladado al valencia ninguna oferta porque la prioridad del jugador era seguir aqu siempre y cuando se llegara a este acuerdo no bamos a revolver en temas que no ven an a cuento es importante que todos sepamos que el valencia ha hecho un esfuerzo muy grande y que el jugador ha mantenido esa prioridad desde el principio

3856950 we are very honored to have california florida and arizona regulators come together to share their knowledge and experience with life industry compliance professionals
3856951 these regulators have been leaders at both the state and naic levels on senior protection and other important industry issues
3856952 their participation and perspective will be of great value to attendees who need to stay on top of regulatory needs and expectations
3856953 we are very pleased to report continued record production and financial performance in the second quarter these results exhibit how we are consistently improving our mining operations
3856954 in addition our exploration successes at guanajuato topia and mapimi give us a strong sense of confidence in the companys future
3856955 newly acquired mobile equipment will enable us to extract more ore from the mines and deliver it to the guanajuato plant the plant has the capacity to double the output of the previous quarter
3856956 it is important to understand that extra credit card fees will occur when you are vacationing in another country
3856957 canadians need to understand these foreign exchange and cash advance fees in order to budget for their travel expenses and determine their best course of action for making purchases abroad or withdrawing funds
3856958 there is a lot to consider when it comes to using your credit card while travelling abroad
3856959 to learn more about foreign conversion and cash advance fees i invite consumers to read our booklet called service fees on credit card transactions i also encourage consumers to use our interactive tool if they are shopping around for a new credit card so that they can pick the one that best suits their needs
3856960 when products releasing high levels of vocs are applied indoors voc emissions can adsorb into porous construction materials and furnishings causing the emissions to linger even longer

3856982 im very happy to come back to the race of champions as its an event that i really enjoy
3856983 it will be very nice to compete against michael again like in 2004 we live very close to each other but rarely have a chance to meet
3856984 last time we actually met was on a track racing motorcycles michael was a little bit faster than me but i hope to get my revenge in identical cars at the race of champions
3856985 i think we all knew the restructuring plan was going to take a lot of time to put together
3856986 whats shocking to me is how long the court of appeals is taking
3856987 ive heard people give me stories like the court should not be rushed into making decisions like this but we do have 2 000 retail investors who have their life savings in limbo
3856988 i think this is a unique enough situation that the decision should be expedited
3856989 im hoping and im hoping and getting really scared they might not pay back the money
3856990 i was looking after money for my niece because she lost both parents and im feeling very guilty
3856991 at this stage i really dont know what ill do going back to real estate is difficult this stage because of the housing market
3856992 i could sell my house but i still have two kids who are living here
3856993 having taken lessons from the past we made diversification a priority and remain disciplined in our execution
3856994 the strategic direction we have chosen has effectively prepared cae for conditions like the present when not all segments of the market and not all regions of the world are firing on all cylinders
3856995 we continue to believe that this guidance is conservative in light of the current market environment and given the 14 full flight simulator orders that cae has received so far this fiscal year
3856996 while we are cutting costs across the organization it is important to note that we intend to increase our investment in research and development projects which will remain the lifeblood of the company
3856997 we are also actively evaluating a number of companies as potential acquisition targets
3856998 these engagements have taken place both at an individual company level and at industry level
3856999 elections are the way we have conversations about the direction the city is going in
3857000 i hope that theres a contested election amp so we can have a conversation about the direction the city is going in thats the way we have the conversation
3857001 i think there are people who dont like the results but i dont think there hasnt been enough public dialog
3857002 what were trying to do is move forward and think about transformative justice what local communities can do to solve problems on their own without relying on the police dss all the major institutions
3857003 how can we right our wrongs when these institutions arent really set up to help us in any case righting our wrongs in more humane ways that dont depend on the state
3857004 this thing is just really a stacked deck for the police
3857005 look at the people who are on it they all have city or police ties its not a true civilian review board who are the civilians on it
3857006 all the young people who come to out now have a story to tell about police harassment
3857007 theres all these complaints stacking up but this board has apparently done nothing theyre still being oriented
3857008 the moral of the story i think is they dont have a lot of power theyve had a few meetings which have apparently been closed door how discouraging for our community when people feel this things just another extension of the state
3857009 we would flip that coin around and teach people to know their rights
3857010 well let the market decide amp if the poor want to eat french fries and tasty cakes thats their decision
3857011 among other restrictions panhandling would be prohibited within 15 feet of a bank atm parking pay box pay phone public toilet or bus stop panhandlers would not be allowed to solicit from any park bench in any public park or under any railroad or street overpass panhandlers would also be barred from passively standing or sitting while asking for money
3857012 i have been approached numerous times by panhandlers when i was at the atm in northampton or putting money in the parking meter
3857013 i do not feel safe when there is someone outside of the atm at 10 at night knowing i just got done withdrawing funds from my bank account
3857014 ive definitely been made uncomfortable by panhandlers especially when im with my kid who will strike up a conversation with anyone i bet more women than men would tell you theyve felt uncomfortable either because theyre more likely to be targeted by aggressive strangers or because theyre more likely to feel vulnerable in public places but often its by people whom i think have some sort of mental illness too or theyre just the general kind of asshole who would say creepy things to passersby whether or not they were looking for money maybe we should make a law against assholes that would be brilliant especially if it applied to lawmakers
3857015 i lived in town for 32 years and no one ever bothered me nor anyone i know
3857016 i have never heard a story about it from anyone except online via masslive or blogs the only time i saw someone get bothered downtown was via physical violence and always between familar parties i never saw a panhandler accost or harass anyone or do more than simply and quietly ask someone for change and i lived downtown it was my backyard for every one of those years
3857017 they cant go back and say you know what we want to ask this witness questions amp theyre a watered down version of the former police commission
3857018 i dont know what action the council will take on it
3857019 but with or without the council i intend on pushing for a model that has some teeth that has some statutory authority that actually can do some independent investigations on police misconduct cases and not just settle for a board in a name only
3857020 one of the things our city has successfully done is to quiet those who have spoken with a loud voice about police reform police brutality and those types of issues
3857021 slowly but surely those individuals found themselves at points of scrutiny in their own personal lives they found doors being closed in their faces and they decided the level of activism they were doing was not worth the personal loss
3857022 its not like the 90s when you had a number of us out there
3857023 now its at a point where any of us who are willing to say anything are just kind of flapping in the wind by ourselves at least before we had several other strong members of the community to stand behind us
3857024 one of the real issues for me is that the administration has not looked at the criticisms in a constructive manner
3857025 theyve interpreted those of us whove been vocal about this as attacking the character of individuals amp i dont think anyone was trying to impugne the integrity of anyone on the review board nor was anyone saying denise jordan didnt have the right abilities to be the administrator what were saying is the civilian review board is too important to receive a limited amount of time from a chief of staff who already has a thousand things on her plate
3857026 no intention of moving hastily simply to satisfy the timeline of others
3857027 there are many of us whove been pushing for police reform like this for the last 15 years
3857028 its not like the clock started ticking when mayor sarno took office in january
3857029 its not like time stopped on every issue this is a continuation of a process that started three years ago it hasnt only been seven months its been three years
3857030 im not sure that anybody can legitimately say that mccain is conservative
3857031 they had a great time together but they are just in different places in their lives right now
3857032 he never ends things with a clean slate he likes to dwell on these relationships and sort everything out before saying goodbye for good
3857033 so dont be too worried about all that traffic going to youtube
3857034 id be worried if people werent using to youtube since its an enormous success globally we know we will eventually benefit from it
3857035 people think that the value of a stock is really the dollars
3857036 we dont want it to get in the way of running the business
3857037 if we started giving quarterly guidance all of a sudden the whole company would start focusing on the quarter rather than trying to change the world

3857044 we are very excited to begin working with one of the top developers and publishers of online gaming content in the world signing this licensing deal is the next step in securing our position as a professional market player across the region i am sure that this is the start of a long term partnership between both companies and we look forward to working closely with codemasters online and netdevil on this incredible next generation mmo
3857045 i was lonely but that was fine it seems now that back then i was intent on gathering together all the forms of loneliness that i could
3857046 my whole thing is that that i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and script writing and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so high brow and so f king smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what f ck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
3857047 as we began 2008 we recognized that this would be a year of rebuilding for menu i am pleased to report that the good progress made against this objective in the first quarter of 2008 continued in the quarter ended june 30 2008
3857048 while the 2007 recall is now largely behind us its impact on our profitability and on our leverage ratios will be felt for some time to come
3857049 i have a keepsake mold of caitlins hand that was made just before she died and its the one thing that i can look at and touch
3857050 besides pictures thats all i have left of her and it means a lot to me
3857051 i didnt know what i was doing the first time
3857052 there were around 100 people and i just opened up my house in glen ellyn and it was combination raffle and auction and we made 7 000
3857053 and he spends about six months a year on this project writing letters to people with ties to famous people to help out
3857054 we tell people they can bring friends if they want
3857055 i think it touches a lot of people because its for sick kids
3857056 and people love matt and know what hes been through and want to support him because they know this is important to matt
3857057 a lot of parents give back to the hospitals that took care of their children but matts been amazing
3857058 just the stamina that hes had year after year and the proceeds from the event increasing exponentially thats whats unbelievable
3857059 literally last year we were in a tight financial situation until we got matts 14 000 donation which was enough to keep us going where we could line up more funding
3857060 when you look at our budget which is in the low 50 000s the donation is a big chunk of our budget and unlike grants matt allows us to use the money for more than just the handmolds
3857061 if done well it gives a very real replica of the childs hand that captures the lines and prints
3857062 she was kind of always up for anything when they asked if she wanted to go to opening day at the cubs game she was ready for it she was just full of life no matter what she was going through
3857063 they ask if you want a keepsake and we just said yes im so glad we did
3857064 its just like having a little piece of the person with them thats tangible that they can look at and feel
3857065 with children there are often so little memories because of how short their lives are and to have that actual concrete piece of that person is very meaningful to many parents
3857066 i know what it is for me and it may not be the same for someone else but i just want others to have this available to them
3857067 i know what happened to caitlin is not hereditary but in the back of my mind its there

3857074 tomorrow were going to negotiate all day i cant predict the result but its clear that were closer to the demands of prime minister donald tusk than we were a month ago
3857075 we are perhaps going to reap the reward of our efforts
3857076 the american side has considerably softened its stance over recent days
3857077 they are much readier to accept polands two cardinal conditions
3857078 today were facing a new international situation the situation doesnt change our arguments but in my view reinforces them
3857079 the rising international tension which has caught us by surprise makes security guarantees even more important than ever
3857080 the events in the caucasus show clearly that such security guarantees are indispensable
3857081 as soon as we are sure that polands security has been reinforced to the degree we want were not going to wait for hours to sign a deal
3857082 money is merely a method of exchange and is only worth what someone else is willing to give you for it

3857128 i think they kind of grasp what is going on

3857139 las dos partes quer an llegar a un acuerdo y al final se ha producido de manera satisfactoria
3857140 tanto el jugador como nosotros quer amos que siguiera muchos a os defendiendo al valencia y al final hemos llegado a un acuerdo que se preve a por las intenciones de ambas partes
3857141 lo que nos deja a todos muy contentos a todos es anunciar que el acuerdo es total para el jugador ha sido una decisi n muy importante y hay que recalcar el esfuerzo del valencia por mantener en su plantilla a un jugador como silva

3857200 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3857201 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3857204 nothing i just knew you would want to contact that couple once you saw their profile
3857205 so if the chemistry is right would you guys be interested in continuing the party back at our place
3857206 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3857207 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3857208 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3857209 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3857210 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3857211 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3857212 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3857213 not every fighting is warfare while georgia is obviously under a ddos attack and it is political in nature it doesnt so far seem different than any other online aftermath by fans political tensions are always followed by online attacks by sympathizers
3857214 coulda shoulda the nature of whats going on isnt clear but until we are certain anything state sponsored is happening on the internet it is my official opinion this is not warfare but just some unaffiliated attacks by russian hackers and or some rioting by enthusiastic russian supporters
3857215 what matters is that the internet is being used as a tool in warfare
3857216 lets not put a diminutive feel on these cyberattacks a ddos attack is still a serious event and according to some of the statistics provided very few web sites would have been able to withstand these onslaughts
3857217 these days it doesnt take a tank to participate in a war but only home broadband and a computer the internet can bring a war right into your own home in more than one way
3857218 the attackers are using the same tools and the same attack commands that have been used by the rbn and in some cases the attacks are being launched from computers they are known to control
3857219 we are simply seeing the attacks coming from known services
3857220 hes so quiet that you dont think hes focused or into this thing
3857221 but you click on a film or its game day and hes right there
3857222 great teams have adversity and we got to find a way to fight through the adversity
3857223 we all went into the training room and gave him a hug and told him we were thinking about him and i think that brought us together closer
3857224 you got to trust whoevers in there no matter who they are
3857225 hes shown good steps and good initiative to get better
3857226 honestly i didnt expect him to jump to a starting roll but hes come into camp and hes worked his butt off hes earned everything hes gotten
3857227 i took the housing portion of the loan moved back in with my parents and started the ecoproducts company thats what mbas are supposed to do i just advanced the timeline a little
3857228 of all the places in the world i found that the chinese government had commissioned research to develop a true cradle to cradle technology to reduce carbon emissions produced by slash and burn farming techniques
3857229 i was seriously terrified that matthew stafford was going to break his back trying to do a back flip
3857230 if one of those guys got hurt while i was guarding i would never forgive myself none of my friends would ever forgive me
3857231 when the weather hit like it did i had them convinced we were going to come over here and do a walkthrough like we normally do on a rain day
3857232 so we got in there and stretched a little bit and i told everyone to get nice and flexible so they dont pull a hamstring off the high dive
3857233 i dont know if i was truly vertical i dont know how big the splash was at the end were trying to minimize splashes
3857234 i think that those kids are definitely ahead of the game
3857235 not that the other guys cant make it up but its an advantage to get here and go through spring
3857236 were all the same kind of guys were all outgoing like to have fun when its time to work we work it worked out pretty well
3857237 hell go in the fridge and take out some jelly and leave it out hell come in the room from class take off his shoes and his bag in the living room and go in his room
3857238 we get on him all the time he dont listen
3857239 donatvius never ever finishes a meal hell buy loads of food and always have leftovers
3857240 richard is the total opposite of dontavius he eats like a horse
3857241 if anybody wanted to retaliate i wasnt going to do nothing
3857242 its about getting an education becoming a better man just growing i feel like weve done a good job of that
3857243 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3857244 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3857245 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3857246 asumir el aumento del gasto social por prestaciones de desempleo y mantener el esfuerzo inversor en las actividades fundamentales para la actividad econ mica
3857247 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3857248 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3857249 canadian regulatory approval is the culminating step to launch aurigen reinsurance company and provide the canadian life insurance market with greater choice for its reinsurance partners

3857251 she got to the point where she could joke about it
3857252 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real

3857257 conosco benissimo andrea magro il ct della scherma medagliato anche a pechino ndr
3857258 no perch sono convinto che arriveranno giocatori forti e ci faranno comodo completeranno la rosa per un campionato lungo e mi fido totalmente di chi gi c vedrete di che pasta sono fatti
3857259 e vero ma abbiamo vinto delle partite anche senza di lui il resto della squadra rimasto salvo giuly che poteva farci comodo la societ deve poter lavorare tranquilla nel rispetto delle regole interne facendo del proprio meglio sul mercato
3857260 anche stamani abbiamo sorriso e sorrideremo pure domani per ci fa piacere che francesco domani possa tornare a darci una mano in campo lintenzione quella
3857261 suazo uno che avevamo visto un anno fa e che conosciamo bene abbiamo sotto tiro una serie di nomi valuteremo strada facendo chi pu fare al caso nostro
3857262 quando a un calciatore vengono offerti pi soldi va altrove
3857263 parto sempre dal presupposto della disponibilit al lavoro ci presenteremo allinizio della stagione nelle condizioni ottimali e chiaro che nellambito del campionato bisogna fare attenzione a completare la rosa ma la squadra che ha ottenuto tutti questi grandi risultati negli ultimi anni questa qui tranne mancini e poi vucinic il valore aggiunto ha delle grandi potenzialit lavete scritto anche tutti voi
3857264 su doni sono stato tranquillizato dal medico per la supercoppa sar pronto poi per i dettagli nella roma lavorano dei professionisti chiedete a brozzi sul vice doni artur per ora non lo conosciamo ancora approfonditamente stiamo valutando delle situazioni di mercato prenderemo in considerazione alcune cose che vanno analizzate in profondit pu essere che servir un quarto portiere la stiuazione che stiamo vivendo pu esserci dinsegnamento
3857265 non lo so chiaro che se c qualcuno che ti crea difficolt che usa il nome della roma bene farci attenzione gurdate i procuratori di ciss e nen sfruttano la roma perch non sono giocatori che non abbiamo mai richiesto e che non ci interessano invece voi dite di s ci sentiamo presi per il naso e non ci va bene
3857266 lho vista ha fatto una buonissima partita al di l del potenziale dellavversario ha dato continuit a quanto espresso lanno scorso ha una rosa importante per le prime quarto posizioni
3857267 non sono queste le partite che indicano il valore delle squadre sappiamo quali sono gli organici competitivi milan juve e inter li hanno di primordine sono tutte in lotta per lo scudetto e per la champions lippi ci ha fatto dei complimenti importanti che ci fanno piacere parla cos perch conosce i nostri giocatori per essere alla pari dellinter servirebbe un allenatore come lui
3857268 a un elemento di quel calibro gli ci vuole poco giocatori cos sanno inserirsi subito
3857269 s se arrivano allultimo per poi ce lo devono dimostrare sul campo di essere dei giocatori importanti
3857270 i miei colleghi per arrivare fin qui meritano rispetto sar cos pure per mourinho non entro per nel merito delle polemiche
3857271 alberto sta facendo bene si sta allenando intensamente in questa prima parte di allenamenti dedicata alla fatica lho visto con le intenzioni giuste ed la cosa pi importante alberto lo conosco bene in tutte le posizioni del campo
3857272 ci ho vinto una coppa con questo modulo sviluppando risulatati in partite importanti e che non ci fa stravolgere i ruoli dei giocatori permette di aumentare il quantitativo di palloni a centrocampo in base alle caratteristiche dei nostri giocatori ti d dei vantaggi nellimpostazione del gioco e un modulo che conosco bene
3857273 forse quello che gli capitato un po di tempo fa gli lasciato qualche segno magari meno tranquillo ma non nervoso philippe vuole mettere in campo questa sua aggressivit e ci sta a volte di oltrepassare il limite e di sconfinare nel nervosismo e una carica nervosa che gli viene richiesta sempre nel rispetto degli avversari comunque se ne parla tra di noi e i giocatori trovano la soluzione sempre da soli
3857274 creer disturbio ma dar pure dei vantaggi alla societ per la maggiore visibilit che viene data alla squadra domenech ha preso coscienza dellimportanza di mexes e un segnale che phil deve saper sfruttare
3857275 sicuramente s un allenatore deve stare attento a sfruttare le caratteristiche dei giocatori per metterli a proprio agio
3857276 bisogna completare la rosa vediamo quello che ci sta succedendo con dei giocatori che non si pososno schierare il momento difficile ci pu sempre capitare ci star sempre di vincere o perdere ma cercando di offrire una buona prestazione
3857277 i am deeply concerned by reports that russian troops have moved beyond the south ossetian zone of conflict attacked the georgian town of gori and are threatening georgias capital of tbilisi
3857278 none of these prophylactic measures will have a significant impact in todays fragile markets if the sec fails to promptly bring enforcement actions against those who are engaged in abusive and manipulative short selling

3857280 my idea of heaven tastes like a trevisana from fornino
3857281 i had something called the greg roll and it is one of the best rolls i have ever had
3857282 10 for a bar on the upper east yah no thanks
3857283 mark is one of those what do you call them self realization guys
3857284 some coaches get so wrapped up in what theyre doing in doing things their way and not changing it becomes counterproductive part of mark i think was concerned could that be happening to me
3857285 only somebody in the crowd thought i meant everybody and everybody went
3857286 but when i saw that exuberance when i saw that energy when i saw the passion and the fire get unleashed that had been dormant in this football team i got excited i got fired up
3857287 youve got a pretty good chance to be playing in that big game at the end of the season
3857288 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
3857289 theres no way you can say it hasnt been a distraction
3857290 go back to last year and we shouldnt have been dancing on vanderbilts v shoot we probably shouldnt have been dancing against florida but whats done is done
3857291 it was a bad deal it will forever be in the mind of urban meyer and our football team well handle it and its going to be a big deal
3857292 wow i never would have thought of that and couldnt get it anywhere else
3857293 i have yet to wait on a line at this grocery and the girls at the register are always so quick and pleasant
3857294 wouldnt it be nice to go somewhere with a fireplace
3857295 i frequent this place for lunch every chance i get
3857296 yes but to be honest the guys might not feel like making it
3857297 i had something called the greg roll and it is one of the best rolls i have ever had
3857298 would have shared with us if it werent so good

3857301 to promote the progress of science to advance the national health prosperity and welfare and to secure the national defence
3857302 vooral op plekken waar stroefheid noodzakelijk is zoals in bochten of rechte stukken waar autos vaak moeten remmen kan achtergebleven rubber op het asfalt linke soep zijn zegt walter gerritsen deskundige bij koac npc
3857303 maar na een miezerbuitje is het oppassen geblazen en kunnen gevaarlijke situaties ontstaan door een verminderde grip van autobanden op de weg de rubberdeeltjes vormen met weinig regenwater een glijlaagje tussen band en asfalt
3857304 als een automobilist na afloop een ongeluk krijgt door een gladde plek ligt de aansprakelijkheid daarvoor niet meer bij de organisatie maar bij de gemeente
3857305 als deze dienst vindt dat de fraaie handtekeningen van coureurs gevaar opleveren betalen wij de kosten die rotterdam maakt voor het weghalen van het burned rubber
3857306 de organisator moet het asfalt opleveren zoals het voor de race was en zelf een bedrijf inhuren voor reiniging
3857307 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3857308 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3857309 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3857310 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3857311 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3857312 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3857313 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3857314 obviously theres history here its been liberal for quite some time
3857315 this riding may surprise some people that feeling of being taken for granted is a disagreeable sentiment
3857316 there wasnt a period in my life like serena went through where i was doing drugs and having sex with my best friends boyfriend
3857317 i never went through that kind of crazy ive kissed just three people in my life other than stuff that ive done for tv or movies i know im weird i hope brad pitt doesnt hear this hes never going to want to marry me
3857318 declared war on everything called arab american and everything called muslim
3857319 grand jihad in eliminating and destroying the western civilization from within
3857320 rather than denying that she made these remarks or criticizing the translation
3857321 she instead insists that the negative spin andrews applies isnt warranted and then digs herself into a hole in an attempt to explain
3857322 that was a real pretty dance that dance they just did
3857323 sounded like somebody hitting a milk bottle with a ball peen hammer
3857324 id think it would be real interesting hearing all the different sounds
3857325 only if i was handicapper general you know what i would do
3857326 id have chimes on sunday just chimes kind of in honor of religion
3857327 why dont you stretch out on the sofa sos you can rest your handicap bag on the pillows honeybunch
3857328 go on and rest the bag for a little while
3857329 i dont care if youre not equal to me for a while
3857330 i dont notice it any more its just a part of me
3857331 if there was just some way we could make a little hole in the bottom of the bag and just take out a few of them lead balls just a few
3857332 two years in prison and two thousand dollars fine for every ball i took out
3857333 if you could just take a few out when you came home from work
3857334 i mean you dont compete with anybody around here you just set around
3857335 then other peopled get away with it and pretty soon wed be right back to the dark ages again with everybody competing against everybody else you wouldnt like that would you
3857336 the minute people start cheating on laws what do you think happens to society
3857337 he tried thats the big thing he tried to do the best he could with what god gave him he should get a nice raise for trying so hard
3857338 has just escaped from jail where he was held on suspicion of plotting to overthrow the government he is a genius and an athlete is under handicapped and should be regarded as extremely dangerous
3857339 do not i repeat do not try to reason with him
3857340 do you hear i am the emperor everybody must do what i say at once
3857341 crippled hobbled sickened i am a greater ruler than any man who ever lived now watch me become what i can become
3857342 let the first woman who dares rise to her feet claim her mate and her throne

3857345 simply the best rss reader fast lightweight and cross platform
3857346 best rss reader there is very polished and attention to detail
3857347 i would give rssowl my first newborn yes its that good
3857348 its my job to be the kind of partner i want
3857349 i think instead of criticizing what can i do differently or what am i doing that is upsetting him
3857350 counting prevents fights from escalating because by the time im done i either forget why i am mad or i realize that what im angry about is unimportant
3857351 but theres a big difference between we never go out to dinner and id like to go out for dinner
3857352 asking sets a positive tone and is more likely to get results
3857353 just because the honeymoon ends doesnt mean the romance has to stop
3857354 we are still holding hands making love and skiing down mountains together we knew wed be happy when we met more than five decades ago but the reality is better than our dreams
3857355 last year we finished towards the bottom in the nation in passing thank god for rashard mendenhall he would carry this team a lot last year but now hes gone
3857356 regular income into the account for at least a decade and had no credit history had no qualms about giving me a credit card with a very small limit the sole purpose of which was fraud protection i e something i could use online and that didnt expose my main account to vulnerability
3857357 i really think its realistic i give it a 50 50 chance
3857358 i would love to be the class of olympic athletes to sweep but everything has to go right
3857359 if we dont go out there and hit the marks that were supposed to hit then we dont dominate because there are a lot of quality european athletes
3857360 its always important to win your first game in the olympics
3857361 next time i think i need to have more control

3857366 there wasnt anything that occurred that she could be suing over
3857367 just a power of the wills it was very authoritative on both parts
3857368 we have instructions from gen oviedo to collaborate as much as possible with lugo because this is the only way to lift this country out of poverty
3857369 will not sabotage fernando lugo nor create a climate of hostility during his term
3857370 on the clock striking twelve he appeared slightly agitated but he soon recovered walked twice or thrice along the coach house stopped to bark staggered exclaimed halloa old girl his favorite expression and died the children seem rather glad of it he bit their ankles but that was play
3857371 i lost about 20 pounds but beyond that im feeling fine
3857372 i was just worried about him and just wanted him to know that we still love him
3857373 we got together in the locker room and gave him a big hug and just told him how we felt about him
3857374 hes too passionate just to give it up like that
3857375 he loves the game he loves the game so much hes going to ride this thing until the wheels fall off ill tell you that
3857376 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything
3857377 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him
3857378 on the court hes crazy but off the court hell do anything for you
3857379 all the guys who played at uconn have calhouns voice in there mind somewhere in the back of their head somewhere as they are moving throughout life whether doing something right or wrong
3857380 you know that there is something that he instilled in you that allowed you to be who you are today
3857381 its not just music for the united states its world music
3857382 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
3857383 its totally given me a new energey a new everything
3857384 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
3857385 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
3857386 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3857387 with my fan base being broader and larger now im looking to somewhere where somebody can really take advantage of that and take it to the next level
3857388 this senseless tragedy comes as a shock to all of us we pray for his full and speedy recovery
3857389 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3857390 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3857391 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3857392 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3857393 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3857394 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3857395 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem
3857396 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3857397 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3857398 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3857399 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3857400 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3857401 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3857402 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3857403 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory
3857404 ive seen the theories that he was a pawn like lee harvey oswald thats going to be hard to disprove
3857405 how do you disprove that a dead man was not a puppet being manipulated by the cia youre talking about proving a negative you cant prove aliens didnt mail the letters
3857406 but i never saw anyone else like family or kids
3857407 were just glad we were able to get to them
3857408 not enough of the symptoms to meet the diagnostic criteria but enough to be considered especially persnickety
3857409 if my parents didnt give me separate plates for my chicken mashed potatoes and spinach i would get visibly anxious and wouldnt eat anything
3857410 hello ladies whats a bunch of pretty women like yourself doing in a place like this
3857411 yea were just here minding our own business why dont you do the same
3857412 if i wanted to have lunch with my mom i would have invited her
3857413 hey honey why dont we go over to one of those little tables over there
3857414 oh itll be alright i blow the boss whenever he wants so he doesnt say much to me about me leaving early or showing up late
3857415 oh fuck hes home early you got to get out of here

3857432 ill forgo my own immediate gratification to help a team member succeed because i know the personal joy that i experience when i help another team member
3857433 one of the things i like best about you is
3857434 has priority of use at the very least with respect to key rings calendars decals specification sheets and owners manuals all relating to rambler automobiles
3857435 so there is not enough residual goodwill to avoid abandonment of the rambler mark for automobiles but there apparently is enough to cause consumers to associate ancillary goods with the old automobile
3857436 i guess one can eat his cake and have it too
3857437 you always do what you want to do this is true with every act you may say you had to do something or that you were forced to but actually whatever you choose to do you do by choice only you have the power to choose for yourself
3857438 dont rush to follow through on an idea until you by yourself find yourself getting excited about it if you are going to become a champion of a new idea a new method or a new product make sure youre a believer before you become a preacher

3857449 mr mashaie probably does not know that those he calls people israelis are the same occupiers of houses of millions of palestinians
3857450 the position of the united states is well known they do not want for the time being any military action against iran
3857451 our position is that no option is to be taken off the table but in the meantime we have to make diplomatic progress
3857452 mr mashaei does not have the right to take such a disgraceful stance and he is not competent to hold such a responsibility
3857453 condemning this regretful position we deputies ask dr ahmadinejad to deal with him seriously
3857454 cyberbullying can have a devastating effect on a young person or teacher
3857455 i hope every school will send somebody to this conference so that here in cumbria we can help young people to understand that what might seem like harmless fun can and does put people at risk of taking their own lives
3857456 cyberbullying is one form of bullying that is on the increase and it doesnt end at the school gate or at hometime
3857457 it can go on 24 hours a day every day until it stops if it stops
3857458 we have organised this conference aimed primarily at schools to raise awareness as teachers are often the only people a bullied child can turn to
3857459 i am delighted that we have been able to attract key speakers from leading childrens agencies such as childnet international childline and ceop
3857460 this is a great opportunity for the countys schools to gain really useful information about the issues surrounding cyberbullying

3857508 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything
3857509 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him
3857510 on the court hes crazy but off the court hell do anything for you
3857511 all the guys who played at uconn have calhouns voice in there mind somewhere in the back of their head somewhere as they are moving throughout life whether doing something right or wrong
3857512 you know that there is something that he instilled in you that allowed you to be who you are today
3857513 he has no one to stand up for him at all he has no friends now no one wants to get involved someone has to stand up for him
3857514 theyre trying it in the press and if you dont fight back your clients convicted before you even have the trial

3857526 its not just music for the united states its world music

3857561 not only could mhc similarity in couples lead to fertility problems
3857562 but it could ultimately lead to the breakdown of relationships when women stop using the contraceptive pill as odor perception plays a significant role in maintaining attraction to partners
3857563 when women are pregnant theres no selection pressure evolutionarily speaking for having a preference for genetically dissimilar odors
3857564 and if there is any pressure at all it would be towards relatives who would be more genetically similar because the relatives would help those individuals rear the baby

3857609 but in saying that i also dont want my kids being guinea pigs where every two years something new is being changed or adapted
3857610 to me going into french immersion in grade 3 is better than starting them at grade 6
3857611 i still think it should be offered at primary to give people a choice what program they want to put their kids in at the entry level
3857612 i think thats going to make a lot of kids turn on the language rather than get them to enjoy it
3857613 im pleased that they have decided to introduce french immersion in grade 3 as opposed to just the grade 6 proposal because i think thats way too late
3857614 when you introduce kids at a very young age into french immersion its no big deal for them kids are sponges those first couple years and theyre fearless about learning but if you try and do it in grade 6 theres the social pressures
3857615 i love the idea of my kids being able to learn more than one language
3857616 our sincere hope is that our kids can stay and work in new brunswick when theyre older
3857617 and i think having some basis in french gives them a greater opportunity to be able to stay and work in the province it just opens up more possibilities for them
3857618 i think this whole thing has done some lasting damage to the graham government and to the liberal party
3857619 that old division has been stirred up in a way i think pandoras box has been opened and its not easily shut
3857620 theyre rolling the dice in terms of something that will work
3857621 people are developing an impression of the government and this is adding to it my sense is that the graham government is developing a reputation for itself as not inclined to stick to its guns
3857622 i can remember a time in my life when i was confused about what i was supposed to do with my life
3857623 the town is not in a position to provide a practice track and field facility due to the fact that we have been unable to secure sufficient funding and our town is not in a position to carry the full financial load
3857624 we did a lot of legwork to try and make this happen and not once did we get a commitment there that there was going to be funding available
3857625 i think their silence is telling us theyre not upset that were not in their camp
3857626 that disappoints me more than anything but this town simply cannot afford this on our own
3857627 we havent gotten any more help from them in any way shape or form so were just not able to move ahead with this project were just not able to do it not at the expense of the taxpayers
3857628 we could not have chosen a better spot for todays announcement
3857629 as we work towards a better new brunswick and self sufficient new brunswick we need to build on respect and also to enhance our very special quality of life here in this great province
3857630 we are taking concrete action to protect species at risk their habitat and the scenic beauty that so many associate with this province
3857631 the organizations conservation planning identifies sites which have the highest biodiversity values and are most in need of protection so that investors funds are focused on where they can have the most impact

3857642 health has been a feature of our community for a long time and its obviously under stress we need to find a way to make it better
3857643 theres no question we need doctors and the only way were going to get them here is through community volunteer teamwork
3857644 everybody agrees that something needs to be done and this is probably the way to do it
3857645 we all know we cant expect the provincial government or a non existent health authority to help us out we need to do our bit
3857646 its a starting point to show new doctors about the great lifestyle that exists here
3857647 if you want the best doctors you must compete in the market for them

3857659 fico triste pelo vasco pois essa foi uma declara o infeliz ofensiva a mim institui o e torcida do corinthians ele foi um irrespons vel e a julgar pelo que disse ter um futuro muito curto na carreira de treinador

3857661 a nossa conversa com o cuca foi no sentido de saber o que ele acha dos nossos planos haja vista que todos os treinadores gostam de trabalhar com atletas que fazem o seu estilo mas estamos em sintonia e as novidades n o devem ser muito diferentes daquilo que j vem sendo especulado
3857662 acredito que todos voc s jornalistas a diretoria e at mesmo os jogadores sabem as car ncias do elenco do fluminense e a diretoria est trabalhando no sentido de refor ar o plantel portanto estou tranq ilo neste aspecto e concentrado apenas em trabalhar com os atletas que j fazem parte do grupo

3857670 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3857671 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3857672 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3857673 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3857674 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3857675 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3857676 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3857677 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3857678 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3857679 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3857680 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3857681 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

3857715 why did this give me concern because of the obvious abortion homosexual and other fundamental reasons would i have has the same issues had he been a mccain supporter probably not why because i too am accustomed to making spiritual decisions on those two major points the fact is they are major and i cannot ignore them nor can i understand how someone could support someone who does stand for those issues pro murder and pro homosexual at the same time i realize that is not the only issues i should be concerned with
3857716 there was one comment where dude was talking about how he loved your 20 amp a prayer campaign but because you supported obama he wouldnt
3857717 i really have strong feelings about this but since i respect ed so much i will keep them to myself
3857718 there was one comment where dude was talking about how he loved your 20 amp a prayer campaign but because you supported obama he wouldnt

3857727 i think its going to be one of the great conspiracy theories like whether we landed on the moon or whether lee harvey oswald acted alone
3857728 there are a lot of people in science who are weird or unstable
3857729 i dont consider myself among the hardcore conspiracy theorists that this is a total cover up it looks more like bungled investigation
3857730 these are people with what appears to be a potential significant motive
3857731 were i an fbi agent i would be investigating them to see whether they actually had means and opportunity to carry out an attack like this
3857732 they didnt decide to pin the job on bruce ivins after they sent out the anthrax letters they had already decided on using him beforehand
3857733 as dangerous as it could possibly be and also deeply mysterious
3857734 its almost a generic aspect of conspiracy theories that some of the most important witnesses or the fall guy for that matter think lee harvey oswald is now dead because they cant contradict or complicate a conspiracy theory
3857735 i believe there is less control in truth in advertising in the spanish media than the english media because ive seen these outrageous claims being made about vitamins and other products
3857736 but i am actually very impressed with the spanish media in terms of their news coverage they have a built in commitment to getting out a lot of information on health issues especially with diabetes
3857737 when asked about why they lack a usual provider 41 percent say the principal reason is that they are seldom sick

3857746 the lhc is a particle accelerator which has been built deep underground in a 27 km tunnel under switzerland and france
3857747 but so much could go wrong it could open a gateway to a parallel dimension or create a black hole and now voices from the past are calling out to people and scientists have started to disappear
3857748 i guess they are going for clean cut and boring when i do release mine and i am tempted to do it on the same day this would be the bigger hit if they change their minds im waiting

3857755 ill never forget the old japanese man who couldnt speak english so he decided to feel for himself if i was real
3857756 at guinness there were days when i felt like i was doing a freak show
3857757 when that feeling came too often i knew i had to come back home
3857758 she loved talking to kids because they would ask more honest questions
3857759 adults would kind of stand back and stare and not know how to approach her
3857760 we changed the collection so it would appeal to lots of different women and a lot more women and we injected a new focus on the design

3857766 if people only know the tv show theyll still find all the characters they love
3857767 and while i didnt read the books until i was an adult i was enthralled by the writing the storytelling and the sense of the american pioneer spirit what makes it worthy material for a musical is that you have in laura a strong protagonist surrounded by a family of fascinating and rich characters
3857768 but from the beginning shes completely reapproached the material theres a good story that melissa told when she came to rehearsal she went to read the books and discovered that all the parts about laura were underlined so she had to buy a whole new set so she could study things from mas perspective
3857769 as a cu city community we are committed to walking our talk when it comes to our communitys safety and quality of life
3857770 thats why the highest ranking staff members of both organizations are joining forces with student leaders to deliver this message in person to students living off campus
3857771 i and other cu leaders value the walkabout because of the interaction it affords us with boulders student residents
3857772 we want to send a personal message to cu students on the value of being considerate neighbors i want to challenge all our student residents of boulder whether they live on campus or not to rise to the challenge of being engaged citizens and responsible residents

3857787 its my appeal that we should adopt a reconciliatory approach so that stability should return
3857788 because if there is stability we can fight terrorism if we have a strong economy we can fight terrorism and we should all put aside our differences and work to make pakistan strong
3857789 in my view someone is conspiring against our institutions either internally or externally
3857790 but i assure you that the nation will stand together like it did in 1947 and it will prove that pakistan will remain intact despite the predictions of its enemies
3857791 it is the absolute height of hypocrisy for the mccain campaign to play the victim after launching attack after attack on for his strong and appropriate response to the conflict in georgia but its characteristic of the old washington tactics that have failed the american people empty words about bipartisanship mean nothing just days after the mccain campaign accused barack obama of being in sync with moscow and not putting his country first senator obama is focused on what the united states and the international community must do to resolve this crisis not on the tired political games that have stood in the way of progress
3857792 now is the time for action not just words it is past time for the russian government to immediately sign and implement a cease fire russia must halt its violation of georgian airspace and withdraw its georgia with international monitors to verify that these obligations are met

3857800 going forward the united states and europe must support the people of georgia
3857801 the relationship between russia and the west is long and complicated there have been many turning points for good and ill this is another turning point
3857802 let me be clear we seek a future of cooperative engagement with the russian government and friendship with the russian people
3857803 i just spoke separately with secretary rice and president saakashvili about the grave crisis in georgia i told president saakashvili that i was deeply concerned about the well being of the people of georgia
3857804 over the last two days russia has escalated the crisis in georgia through its clear and continued violation of georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity
3857805 as i have said for many months aggressive diplomatic action must be taken to reach a political resolution to this crisis and to assure that georgias sovereignty is protected
3857806 i strongly condemn the outbreak of violence in georgia and urge an immediate end to armed conflict now is the time for georgia and russia to show restraint and to avoid an escalation to full scale war georgias territorial integrity must be respected all sides should enter into direct talks on behalf of stability in georgia and the united states the united nations security council and the international community should fully support a peaceful resolution to this crisis

3857817 with gas prices soaring and many of our employees traveling long distances to get to work we thought that it would be a great idea to offer our employees an alternative workweek schedule
3857818 not only will it cut down the costs of travel for employees who in essence will have an additional month off per year when you add up all the fridays that they dont have to work but it will also reduce operating costs at the 8484 wilshire blvd building

3857849 these statistics make it clear that the boom in the prison industry is fed in part by the closing of our mental institutions
3857850 prisons have become the nations primary mental health facilities said jamie fellner director of human rights watchs u s program
3857851 there has been no increase in the relative number of people with mental illnesses in correctional systems the absolute numbers have increased but not the proportions there is an increase in absolute numbers of mentally ill prisoners because the prison population as a whole has increased

3857864 as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to the most serious environmental problems at every scale from local to global
3857865 one personal act that can have a profound impact on these environmental issues is reducing meat consumption considering the tonnage americans consume even modest reductions in meat consumption would substantially reduce the burden on our natural resources
3857866 the united states stands with the democratically elected government of georgia and insists that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of georgia be respected
3857867 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must keep its word and act to end this crisis
3857868 all lines of communication and transport including seaports roads and airports
3857869 there are confused reports and varying reports that are coming in
3857870 were doing our best to keep up with them and to best understand the situation its not the easiest thing in the world given the geography and the cutoff of information
3857871 russia has sought to integrate into the diplomatic political economic and security structures of the 21st century the united states has supported those efforts
3857872 now russia is putting its aspirations at risk by taking actions in georgia that are inconsistent with the principles of those institutions
3857873 a special project of the united states and we understand that the united states is worried about its project
3857874 either support for a virtual project or real partnership on issues that really demand collective action
3857875 not only those who commit atrocities are responsible but so are those who fail to react

3857879 i still dont think if you said to mccain flat out do you approve of that kind of message that he would necessarily agree with it or support it

3857882 everybody listened to the same music on the radio i miss monoculture i think its good for people to have a shared experience
3857883 expect large changes of pitch in a melody to be followed by a change of direction
3857884 the rise of cheap distribution means there are more genres and sub genres than there used to be and also that acts dont need to broaden their appeal so much as they once did if you dont need to get on a top 40 station to make it big you will lose the elements you once might have added to attract that audience
3857885 on most modern cds the music is squashed into the top 5 db of a medium that has over 90 db of range
3857886 not only are the volume differentials flattened when you compress music but bass and treble frequencies are pressed into the midrange and the space surrounding instruments is lost making them less easy to separate when you listen
3857887 by the time youve listened closely or tried to to a whole album thats heavily compressed you end up feeling like alex at the end of a clockwork orange battered fatigued by and disgusted with the music you love
3857888 the acceleration and splintering of media destroys the potential for cultural universals
3857889 there are fewer and fewer specific cultural touchstones that every member of a certain generation shares simultaneously johnny carson led zeppelin jaws etc as a result people end up feeling alienated by their own normalcy they feel lonely within a crowd and this is a huge cultural problem
3857890 i understand that we cant have it the monoculture back and that there are reasons why we shouldnt
3857891 although todays hits may no longer reach the sales volumes typical of the pre piracy era an ever smaller set of top titles continues to account for a large chunk of the overall demand for music

3857905 the chancellor is firmly convinced that this is not the time for looking into motives for allocating blame for denouncing anyone or for making final judgments
3857906 i think the eu should make russia a very clear proposal with clearly stated expectations in order to positively influence russias future behavior
3857907 i see no reason why there ought to be so many clubs able to black out in those territories thats my intention thats my goal i didnt get any pushback the whole thing is about making the game more popular and available

3857923 they just dont want freedom and thats why they want to stamp on georgia and destroy it
3857924 but you know its not in the 21st century to bomb a neighbor country its not a good idea
3857925 i say once again its better to compete on the field rather than outside the field
3857926 dont indulge yourself by showing off the moment that you begin to find that you can do something well you must control it and do it more selectively
3857927 do you think christ never laughed or told jokes he would have told the best jokes and laughed the hardest
3857928 at first when he came with a little knife i didnt realise he was trying to rob my shop i thought it was a joke
3857929 i thought he couldnt do much with his little knife so i went to the back of the shop and got a mop and started hitting him
3857930 i was just trying to defend myself and the shop i work from 9am until we close at 10 30pm seven days a week
3857931 i took my hands up and said go ahead and take everything
3857932 if i did some damage to him then id get in trouble too

3857956 i was thinking is this real hes a teacher it felt almost like a movie like it wasnt happening
3857957 we know there are a lot of people who believe in us and the music that were making
3857958 its a really cool feeling that our music touches people like that
3857959 we just stay motivated no matter what to keep creating conscious music for the people
3857960 were not trying to take what the pioneers set out with and change it for our convenience
3857961 we maintain within the principles reggae started out with our music has fusion in it but at the same time we try to keep it within the authenticity of how jamaican reggae was originally played
3857962 weve gone through a lot of drummers over the years
3857963 at one point we had like seven or eight drummers in rotation that we were using at our gigs
3857964 the way people come out and appreciate this band is just a great feeling all around
3857965 im not going to teach your boyfriend how to dance with you
3857966 im from where the gold and diamonds are ripped from the earth right next to the slave castles where the water is cursed from where police brutalitys not half as nice and makes the hood in america look like paradise
3857967 youre the finest thing that ive done the hurricane ill never outrun i could wait around for the dust to still but i dont believe that it ever will
3857968 i dont think being in a band right now is easy for anyone because folks went through the 60s and 70s where the only thing that could make your band huge was word of mouth and being completely amazing
3857969 you get around to the 90s and early 2000s and myspace is around and it becomes really easy to be in a band i dont want to sound pessimistic theres just a lot of crap out there
3857970 we recorded two albums before we ever went on tour
3857971 we just went through hell touring on these really amazing tours with really great bands but doing it in a van by ourselves was pretty much the most brutal thing in the world driving 12 hours a night and not sleeping or showering ever was intense it pretty much tore us apart then on our headlining tour we realized how stupid it would be for our band to break up because we realized that this is something special how could we possibly give this up
3857972 its pretty amazing watching the faces of the people and seeing them sing along its the coolest thing in the world because imagine writing a book and watching everyone read it just being so happy that youre reading it with them you get the ultimate high off of that you can have the audience do whatever you want and they love it and you love them back for it its a pretty circular and beautiful thing
3857973 with all respect to a lot of the newer american players
3857974 some of them are playing it safe theyre looking for the crossover appeal whereas the europeans remind me of the early stages of bebop when it was monk and bird and diz and bud powell and those cats theyre playing from their soul and are much more adventurous whenever you get some european or swedish jazz you know its going to be a treat
3857975 the last place i worked was pretty conservative and i needed a place people could be freely expressive
3857976 that and i took a landmark communication seminar and it really opened doors

3858038 our work is revealing how we may actually use more of the entire sugarcane plant millions of tonnes of unused plant matter or biomass for future manufacturing and energy production of which waterproof cardboard might provide just one very promising commercial option
3858039 the crc process requires the extraction of cellulose taken from the cane biomass and then combined with new fermentation technology to make a type of lignin that would form the basis of a waterproof coating for a variety of papers
3858040 our process would potentially allow sugarcane growers and mills to team up with paper manufacturers to produce an internationally sought after waterproof and biodegradable products waterproof cardboard boxes and containers waterproof paper bill boards even waterproof paper tarpaulins for emergency relief all made from natural materials and all 100 per cent recyclable and environmentally friendly
3858041 across the globe food and beverage manufacturers are dependent on paper based packaging and cardboard to store and transport their goods safely to the consumer today the only available technology to manufacturers is cardboard coated with a petroleum based wax which renders the packaging non recyclable or petroleum based plastics fully recyclable waterproof paper board could reduce billions of tonnes of landfill around the world

3858124 broadly speaking when it comes to americas engagement with the rest of the world it is important that the military is and is clearly seen to be in a supporting role to civilian agencies

3858126 americas civilian institutions of diplomacy and development have been chronically undermanned and underfunded for far too long relative to what we traditionally spend on the military and more importantly relative to the responsibilities and challenges our nation has around the world

3858200 without question we need to disarm saddam hussein he is a brutal murderous dictator leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation and now he is miscalculating americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real
3858201 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
3858202 the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 we are confident that saddam hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons
3858203 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
3858204 iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
3858205 we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region he has ignored the mandate of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them
3858206 we know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
3858207 without question we need to disarm saddam hussein he is a brutal murderous dictator leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation and now he is miscalculating americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real
3858208 in the four years since the inspectors left intelligence reports show that saddam hussein has worked to rebuild his chemical and biological weapons stock his missile delivery capability and his nuclear program he has also given aid comfort and sanctuary to terrorists including al qaeda members it is clear however that if left unchecked saddam hussein will continue to increase his capacity to wage biological and chemical warfare and will keep trying to develop nuclear weapons
3858209 the last un weapons inspectors left iraq in october of 1998 we are confident that saddam hussein retains some stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons and that he has since embarked on a crash course to build up his chemical and biological warfare capabilities intelligence reports indicate that he is seeking nuclear weapons
3858210 we have known for many years that saddam hussein is seeking and developing weapons of mass destruction
3858211 iraqs search for weapons of mass destruction has proven impossible to deter and we should assume that it will continue for as long as saddam is in power
3858212 we begin with the common belief that saddam hussein is a tyrant and a threat to the peace and stability of the region he has ignored the mandate of the united nations and is building weapons of mass destruction and the means of delivering them
3858213 we know that he has stored secret supplies of biological and chemical weapons throughout his country
3858214 without question we need to disarm saddam hussein he is a brutal murderous dictator leading an oppressive regime he presents a particularly grievous threat because he is so consistently prone to miscalculation and now he is miscalculating americas response to his continued deceit and his consistent grasp for weapons of mass destruction so the threat of saddam hussein with weapons of mass destruction is real

3858221 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
3858222 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
3858223 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
3858224 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
3858225 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
3858226 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
3858227 if we start losing these smaller reef fish as food to the lionfish we could be in a whirlwind for bad things coming to the reef ecosystem

3858245 tami was created not just for the olympics but it will be used for all our cross platform programming were starting out with the olympics because its such a huge event it provides a good jumping off point it measures exposure it is not a currency and were not selling off it its not an unduplicated reach no way to do that besides we want to measure duplication in fact the more duplication across platforms the better ill be happy when we can retire tami but until the industry adopts single source data but we couldnt wait for that
3858246 more data will be released later but so far half say they wanted to see what they missed 40 percent wanted to see events again by putting so much available online it allows us to catch to the way users watch on demand we feared in 2004 having seven networks it would be too much and dilute the main coverage on broadcast multiplatform has helped boost tv
3858247 these olympics are influencing how people are using new technology half of the people viewing on mobile are using it for the first time after the olympics it will be intersting if these habits become part of their behavior

3858255 we know of no other such seed grant competition where almost 100 asu faculty members submitted proposals the uniformly high quality of the applications as well as the high response rate signals a very bright future for global engagement at asu
3858256 we were thrilled to receive so many excellent proposals and we regret being able to fund only a relatively small number of extremely interesting submissions
3858257 but we are confident that the incredible response affirms to all that global programs are central elements of the universitys educational and research agenda and critical to the advancement of the new american university

3858295 neither is it that us foreign policy is cruel because american leaders are cruel its that our leaders are cruel because only those willing to be inordinately cruel and remorseless can hold positions of leadership in the foreign policy establishment it might as well be written into the job description people capable of expressing a full human measure of compassion and empathy toward faraway powerless strangers let alone american soldiers do not become president of the united states or vice president or secretary of state or national security adviser or secretary of the treasury nor do they want to

3858299 this content is kind of terrible do we really have to release this
3858300 i think its a well made picture but while its funny in spots its very english
3858301 i dont think its broadly commercial it feels like a film that deserves a spirited release but not a wide one joel has an 800 screen deal which well honour but we might not be willing to spend the marketing money he wants us to
3858302 the filmmakers have every right to do what they think is best in support of their movies but we have the right to do whats best for warner bros sometimes the pursuit of those interests results in a disagreement for now were preparing to release the film in october but i dont see it starting out on 800 screens if joel is thinking there is someone out there willing to spend twice as much money as were willing to im sure he will pursue that

3858420 inflation has reached 4 5 per cent yet paramedics are being offered annual increases of 3 25 per cent
3858421 basically theyre being offered a pay cut that is something they will not accept
3858422 not one member across the state has told me they support this offer they feel theyre being forced to take industrial action to get a fair deal
3858423 paramedics we surveyed said theyve fallen asleep driving and made mistakes because of their long hours and workload
3858424 they average six hours sleep a night and often less than that
3858425 ambos simply want to make sure they can get enough sleep so theyre safe to drive and do their jobs properly it seems like a no brainer but its been rejected its bizarre

3858429 i was just worried about him and just wanted him to know that we still love him
3858430 we got together in the locker room and gave him a big hug and just told him how we felt about him
3858431 hes too passionate just to give it up like that
3858432 he loves the game he loves the game so much hes going to ride this thing until the wheels fall off ill tell you that
3858433 hes a relentless personality a relentless coach and he just never allows himself to give in to anything
3858434 he attacked this the way he attacks the game and the way he attacks life and didnt let anyone feel sorry for him
3858435 on the court hes crazy but off the court hell do anything for you
3858436 all the guys who played at uconn have calhouns voice in there mind somewhere in the back of their head somewhere as they are moving throughout life whether doing something right or wrong

3858438 i am quite satisfied that this amounts to misconduct in the investigation and prosecution of this case and i categorise it egregious
3858439 but nothing can compensate for the trauma and stress of the past 15 years
3858440 it will go some way to helping rebuild his life and normal existence what he wanted from the outset though was an apology
3858441 reluctantly he has accepted though that he will not get it now from the police

3858468 this blog is my attempt to make peace with the events surrounding the loss of my stepmother kay ferry in writing it i hope to help the reader gain a better understanding of what i believe was an injustice done to my family out of either ignorance malice or even a little bit of both if after reading it you still feel that we are guilty then i can only ask that you offer the same forgiveness to us as we have chosen to offer you
3858469 it wont be the anxiety of oh my god we have to make this race
3858470 but were only in the top 35 by eight points and i dont want to say were good all it takes is one little mistake mechanical or driver error and were right back out friday will definitely be a much better day this week but we want to keep building on the momentum i dont want to just be in the top 35 i want to keep looking forward
3858471 ill figure out how to drive it all we need to do is finish we just need to not crash into anything and not have anything break for the next two or three races and well be fine
3858472 saya mau diusir dari sini surat pemberitahuannya sudah ada di lurah tahun 2009 saya harus sudah pergi
3858473 dia foke mau di lapangan depan dibangun rumah susun yang akan membangun menko kesra abu rizal bakrie
3858474 warna hitam itu warna tuhan bapak saya mengajari ilmu tertinggi sebelum manunggaling kawulo lan gusti adalah saka paraning dumadi dari mana kita berasal dan ke mana kita akan kembali sebelum kita manunggal kita harus memasuki alam kelanggengan keabadian yang disebut alam tan keno kinoyo ngopo itu simbulnya hitam
3858475 kalau sudah manunggaling kawulo lan gusti tidak ada sedikit pun rasa takut apa apa mau kritis mau nggak dapat amplop mau ngadepin siapa pun berani karena itu setiap hari saya selalu mengenakan pakaian hitam baju hitam celana hitam kaos hitam bahkan celana dalam saya pun yang jumlahnya 15 juga hitam
3858476 saya suka warna hitam itu sejak kecil sekitar umur 5 tahun meski demikian kadang masih selang seling dengan warna lain karena orang tua saya ingin baju anaknya tidak terlihat itu itu saja
3858477 baru setelah umur 25 an bersamaan dengan perlawanan saya kepada soeharto tahun 1965 1966 an saya konsisten mengenakan warna hitam sampai sekarang 2 periode manjadi anggota dpr saya sekali pun tidak pernah mengunakan warna lain
3858478 warna hitam itu warna yang paling konsekuen anda pakai baju apa pun apakah warna merah hitam kuning biru putih sekalipun kalau kena cahaya bayangannya akan tetap hitam artinya kalau orang sudah hitam apa yang dia pikirkan rasakan katakan dan lakukan akan sama
3858479 saya pernah diundang di satu universitas islam saya pakai hitam hitam seorang penanya dengan beraninya memaki maki saya dan menyatakan saya pengikut iblis karena selalu pakai hitam hitam saya tidak marah justru saya balik bertanya apakah saudara pernah lihat iblis itu warna hitam hantu yang bisa dilihat yaitu casper saja warnanya putih anda tidak berdasar saya katakan dia nggak bisa ngomong lagi
3858480 wah saya nggak tahu mas pastinya banyak sekali saya nggak pernah ngitung tapi sekarang yang selalu saya pakai sekitar 10 setel
3858481 i made sure i crossed the start finish line at the green dead last
3858482 i made sure a j allmendinger got by me so i could say i went from dead last to wherever we finished from 43
3858483 weve got a couple of weeks here where we can try things and have that flexibility but the good thing is that were not struggling and having to try new things we have the ability to do that if we want to because of where we are in the points but regardless were in a good spot our performance the last couple of weeks has shown that were finally hitting our marks for us its just a matter of going out and doing our thing now
3858484 walk on walk ooon with hope in your heart you never walk alone
3858485 not trying to be negative but the performance of our car just hasnt been there all year long and we cant go into reading and indy looking for miracles all we can do is try to straighten this thing out and try to do well
3858486 alan johnson has done a great job helping phil and trying to change some things around but even alan johnson doesnt have a magic wand
3858487 so im not going into reading looking for miracles im just going there to try to get a consistent race car that hopefully can be fast by the time we get to indy and maybe cause some havoc on the guys in the countdown
3858488 right now i just want to try to salvage a win or two or maybe more and try to keep team morale up its pretty frustrating and its difficult on the team right now
3858489 ive actually been there before when i tested an arca car there in 2006 i like michigan a lot its a cool race track because you can move around a lot even when i tested there im really looking forward to racing there because there are a lot of different grooves and it should be a lot of fun well have to see how the horsepower rule change will affect us there we just have no idea how that changes things for us or if it does at all so im really looking forward to michigan for a lot of reasons
3858490 im definitely eager to get back on an oval road courses are a nice change of pace but i just have fun racing on ovals the road courses are fun because they are different and you get out of the normal everyday routine but im a circle track driver i guess and thats more like what im used to racing at michigan will be fairly similar to kentucky in that both tracks are fast but michigan has even more grooves ive never really raced at michigan so theres some aspect that im not familiar with but i do know that ill need to keep some air under that nose to keep the car turning those kinds of tracks are fun to race for me
3858491 even though hes never been on a two mile oval he won a race at kentucky earlier this year and thats almost as big and almost as fast as michigan with a driver who has a much talent as joey i dont think it will take him too long to adapt im looking forward to working with joey theres going to be some things we are going to have to approach differently than we do with kyle busch the small changes we have to make to get him comfortable shouldnt be a problem its probably going to be the only race we run with joey so it would be that much more gratifying if we could go out there and win it with him i think joey and kyle are probably closer in driving styles than any other two drivers we currently have at jgr i thought i would have to set up a loose race car for kyle but dave rogers no 20 crew chief claims that kyle would get in one of joeys cars and say it was too loose for him joey likes a car to be free and he can drive it that way so thats the approach we are taking
3858492 its difficult to know how much its going to change things until we get through michigan its really hard to put a number on it it could be much less than we think or it could be even greater than we think sometimes when you are going faster its hard to get a car to turn if you are going a bit slower our car might turn even better and lap time wise it might not be as big of a deal as we think its going to be once you get all you can from the engine shop its tough to find more hopefully we can go to michigan and learn what we can do other than under the hood to try to get some of that speed back we would love to go to michigan and win and thats what we are shooting for the straightaways are long and when they take away 15 horsepower thats big i think our chances are going to be as good as anybodys but i think its just the unknown of how much it changes things for us on these types of race tracks
3858493 our sponsorship of the no 21 fusion for the bristol event is the perfect race to coincide with our major milestone of opening up our 500 th store
3858494 it is a great opportunity for us to expose our brand to nascar fans for the first time at arguably one of the most watched races of the year
3858495 our race team is really excited to put the quick lane brand in front of nascar fans for the first time in bristol
3858496 weve had a long relationship with ford and were happy to have their new brand with us out on the track
3858497 having our quick lane brand on the no 21 car allows us to showcase our brand and further builds our relationship with wood brothers racing
3858498 weve had a great relationship through our motorcraft brand on the no 21 for many many years and the addition of quick lane further demonstrates our commitment to high quality convenient service and parts for owners of not just ford vehicles but of all makes and models
3858499 en acceso a los mercados entre otros aspectos todav a no estamos cumpliendo con el corte arancelario promedio m nimo de 54 para los pa ses desarrollados ni estableciendo un techo arancelario sin excepciones ni eliminando la salvaguardia especial para los pa ses desarrollados tampoco estamos cerrando un paquete de productos sensibles sin la creaci n de nuevas cuotas ni eliminando el arancel intra cuota por ltimo pero por ello no menos importante no estamos tratando adecuadamente las cuestiones de particular inter s para los pa ses en desarrollo sin afectar a otros pa ses en desarrollo
3858500 por un lado est eeuu cuya posici n nicamente puede ser calificada de c nica quiere mantener el doble de los subsidios efectivamente utilizados y simult neamente obligar a los pa ses asi ticos a abrir sus mercados a una producci n agr cola subsidiada que liquidar su agricultura local

3858502 weve been in the top half of the ladder the last couple of races and our qualifying has been getting better and thats always a plus
3858503 were still fighting for the top 10 were still not mathematically out but unless we win the next two races and some other guys fall out its next to impossible its disappointing because its a long shot right now
3858504 all we have to do to hang onto a showdown berth is qualify in the top half of the field in reading and thats a big deal
3858505 its been extremely tough on the rockstar energy drink guys but theyre holding their heads high and theyre not giving up id love to win one for them and for dsr and give something back to the team
3858506 maple grove can be a very very fast race track and the conditions should be good if thats the case we should see some good numbers we get that east coast crowd and theyre terrific fans
3858507 the track has been there for a long time and i look forward to it well do the best we can
3858508 i made sure i crossed the start finish line at the green dead last
3858509 this schedule demands the ability of both drivers and teams to master a variety of venues and the challenges each one brings with the end result being a true champion and a driver that is fully prepared to be an indycar series driver
3858510 the opportunity to compete on carb day at indianapolis in front of more than 100 000 fans is an experience that is second to none for our drivers teams and sponsors
3858511 adding two events in canada will also allow us to showcase the future stars of indycar series racing to a new audience
3858512 it will be absolutely fantastic to see the firestone indy lights name back on the streets of long beach where we held our very first firestone indy lights race back in 1991 and in toronto another great venue at which we have a lot of history and as the sole tire supplier to firestone indy lights the diverse schedule presents our engineers the opportunity to provide different tires and technology that are suited to the both the ovals and road street courses we are quite eager to see the 2009 challengers in action in st pete
3858513 i cant wait for you i waited a year for someone to make up his mind and he never did

3858531 when i started in wine about 10 years ago spain was the up and coming wine region and its still the up and coming wine region
3858532 in that period of time south africa up and came other regions up and came spain just seems to be still climbing
3858533 but its a hard wine because if its not fresh which most of it that gets here isnt its really different
3858534 when you drink it straight from the barrel or after its been in the bottle for one month your mind explodes amazing amazing flavors
3858535 education of the retailers would be good most retailers just know they need to have a few bottles on hand for the crazy old person but its a real eye opener when you have a fresh one
3858536 i had no idea where minnesota was even located on a map
3858537 to survive here one truly has to come to terms with the fact that nothing will happen quickly efficiently or politely within government or corporate circles
3858538 but i adore the people they are gregarious boisterous and opinionated willing to entertain with music food or dance at a moments notice i adore the rich history that surrounds us the lush natural surroundings the rich cultural diversity the fresh produce meats and fish and of course the wine
3858539 when we started i thought i needed to do points
3858540 and then i would have 10 wines rated 87 and i like each one for a different reason they scored the same but they had nothing in common at this point if someone asks about a wine ill tell you what i think ill give it a thumbs up but i wont do points
3858541 and i think the tasting note should die you know how many wines have lemony notes every single white plus they tend to make people intimidated
3858542 if im talking about wine and food im probably about 70 to 80 percent fluent
3858543 pathetic on a bad day and decent on a good day we are functional

3858546 after having been an occupied nation for over 150 years we have asked the united states government to leave our country meanwhile until the united states government leaves lakotah territory we will take every opportunity to insist it follow its own laws and that its states do the same
3858547 according to the civil right act federal marshalls should arrest any state official who tries to stop lakotah from entering the park and fishing however if the united states ignores its own laws to deny lakotah rights it will certainly not be the first time
3858548 it is however understood that in making this recognition and acknowledgement the aforesaid indian nations do not surrender the privilege of hunting fishing or passing over any of the tracts of country heretofore described
3858549 it is hereby expressly understood and agreed by and between the respective parties to this treaty that the execution of this treaty and its ratification by the united states senate shall have the effect and shall be construed as abrogating and annulling all treaties and agreements heretofore entered into between the respective parties hereto so far as such treaties and agreements obligate the united states to furnish and provide money clothing or other articles of property to such indians and bands of indians as become parties to this treaty but no further

3858581 it was nice to get one over marist but all we wanted was to have it for saturday night and give it back on sunday
3858582 quite a few of the players and management actually hired a bus and rode all the way out to msp clubrooms on sunday but nobody was there so they came back
3858583 we tried to do the right thing after doing the wrong thing we know there was an agreement but we thought wed just get one over them
3858584 we thought seeing as they were having it for the first six months cant we just have it for tonight

3858586 norths fronted with an apology because they didnt know where it was

3858811 scheunemanns work as a lobbyist poses valid questions about mccains judgment in choosing someone who and whose firm are paid to promote the interests of other nations
3858812 so one must ask whether mccain is getting disinterested advice at least when the issues concern those nations
3858813 if mccain wants advice from someone whose private interests as a once and future lobbyist may affect the objectivity of the advice thats his choice to make
3858814 this is an issue that he has been involved with for well over a decade

3858824 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3858825 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3858826 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3858827 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

3858829 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3858830 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3858831 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3858832 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3858833 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3858834 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3858835 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3858836 in several respects what the public was told about the nature of the club and what it had to offer was seriously misleading it was what was said at the presentations which induced people to pay a large sum for a facility that is club membership which in reality was worth very little

3858853 my hair got a little bit thin but its starting to come back down now its the closest thing ill ever know to house arrest i didnt have the strength to get out
3858854 one of the reasons i believe were still out here playing music and making people happy and still selling places out is were always giving them their moneys worth there are a lot of problems out there but for two to three hours we make em forget about it
3858855 all you people out there who sent me an e mail i sure thank
3858856 i got hundreds thousands maybe one of the people in my camp said i dont want anybody to know you got hepatitis c they wont book the band thats expletive
3858857 you can get it off the end of a joint
3858858 you can get it off the end of a straw you can get it off the end of a tattoo needle anything that gets in your blood if you get scratched by certain things that people have had their hands on theres all kinds of literature on the net about it
3858859 i believe that unarmed truth and unconditional love will have the final word in reality that is why right temporarily defeated is stronger than evil triumphant
3858860 hi this is todays date is i am in the office please leave your number

3858862 when not interfered with by outside influences everything nature does is done with perfection yet my son shay cannot learn things as other children do he cannot understand things as other children do where is the natural order of things in my son

3858864 were losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning i guess he can be on our team and well try to put him in to bat in the ninth inning
3858865 the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and humanity into this world
3858866 cbs has a done a good job i think in terms of getting the blood system back on track they have a lot of infrastructure capability that we can leverage
3858867 i expect them to work very co operatively with their provincial partners and its going to be good for everybody
3858868 we have for some time been sharing organs across the country even internationally
3858869 we have understandings that if theres a high status liver recipient waiting in edmonton and we have a donor in ontario that the liver from our donor goes there on a priority basis
3858870 i think cbs will be in a better position to make those agreements standard but more important weve been operating till now with rather rudimentary information systems we get information by fax we get it by telephone
3858871 it refers to the situation where i need a kidney transplant i have a family member or a friend whos prepared to give me their kidney but they cant do it because their blood types dont match
3858872 so our thought here is can i trade with somebody else maybe you need a kidney too youve got a family member whos prepared to give a kidney to you but your blood types dont match but when we look at your donor and me and my donor and you the blood types do match so you can do a swap or an exchange
3858873 for every province its better to be doing this nationally because we all share in a bigger pool well all get more matches its an excellent program
3858874 national and provincial registries are critical tools for clinicians and patients these investments mean we will be able to offer hope and save more lives
3858875 i feel like i disappointed myself my coach my family my country everybody
3858876 i know no canadian taxpayer wants to hear that i really did try my best and i really did give everything i have

3858878 nobody made me sign a contract that i would guarantee to win i just signed a contract that i would do my best and train my best and give it everything i can but im sorry unfortunately it wasnt enough today
3858879 i see countries with as small a team as me and in the venue theyve got three coaches a manager a physiotherapist and psychologist and ive got charlie stewart who is trying to play the part of all three and his massages suck
3858880 were saying give us funding and we can produce and the government is saying produce and then well give you funding
3858881 losing funding and things like that i missed the last training camp here as a result and everyone ahead of me didnt so youve got those questions in the back of your head did i do everything i needed to do to be prepared here i did what i could with the resources i had
3858882 its really agonizing when you fall on your butt in front of people and in front of media
3858883 i have been cheering for the canucks for how long and they still never have won a stanley cup

3858947 decades of inaction and inattention have put our dense unhealthy federal forests in danger from modern catastrophic fires
3858948 unfortunately well meaning but misguided federal policies have dominated forest management in the u s turning federal forests into a significant global warming contributor
3858949 in california actively managing our public forests as we do our private forests could meet 30 of the states goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions
3858950 a decade ago the forest service agency spent 307 million on fire suppression last year it spent 1 37 billion fire is chewing through so much forest service money that congress is considering a separate federal account to cover the cost of catastrophic blazes

3858972 he watches films on his own hell be more physical because hes added strength this is a strong mans position in the pac 10
3858973 i think our kids played well for the most part
3858974 we just came up one hit and one run short
3858975 we got guys on we just couldnt get them in
3858976 defense was a key too there were some key situations when we couldnt come up with plays
3858977 everybody knew about him so he didnt see any pitches to drive
3858978 they pitched him away all the time so he just went with them and got a lot of singles
3858979 the first two innings i was getting the ball up
3858980 it was just a matter of finding my vantage point on the mound and hitting my spots
3858981 he goes right after people he was nails today he got behind people but didnt get rattled he battled out there
3858982 i think we had a little more experience and that helped us not to get too up or too down
3858983 i knew i had to do something to spark the team
3858984 it wasnt necessarily getting a hit but getting on base somehow or moving a runner over
3858985 the first two innings i was getting the ball up
3858986 i just had to find my vantage point on the mound once i adjusted i started to find my spots
3858987 he goes right after people he was nails today he didnt get rattled when he fell behind he battled
3858988 i think our coaches did a good job strategically with our pitchers
3858989 they knew how to position them for the playoffs also i knew we needed to get our bats going saturday when the playoffs started once we got a win under our belts i felt we were okay
3858990 it is well known that nassau county is one of the safest counties in the nation
3858991 however there are areas within this great county that have higher incidences of gun violence than others to that end i have made it a priority to eliminate illegal guns from our streets so that everyone can enjoy our low crime rate since taking over as police commissioner i have enacted a three pronged approach to combating gun violence first i began by personally shaking the hand of every officer responsible for taking an illegal gun off of our streets second i created the departments gunstoppers hotline 1 877 4gun411 which enables callers to anonymously provide information regarding the location of an illegal gun if an illegal gun is recovered callers are rewarded through a blind source up to 2 000 third by implementing the shotspotter gunshot location system we will be able to concentrate on the area which currently has a high gun violence rate which is roosevelt and uniondale so that the moment a shot is fired our officers will be notified immediately and can respond instantaneously with the intelligence he or she needs to be most effective i anticipate that this technology will not only reduce gun violence but that it will save lives
3858992 advancements in public safety technology are allowing law enforcement not only to anticipate and prevent crime but to develop new tactics and best practices for more successful crime prevention and policing the nassau county police department has a long tradition of adopting technologies and policies aimed at anticipating and thwarting criminal activity early the shotspotter gunshot location system will enable commissioner mulvey and the officers of the nassau county police department both to respond more rapidly to gunfire and also to use information gathered by the system to monitor and analyze gun crime trends within the shotspotter gls coverage area and to develop cutting edge tactics and programs for eradicating gun violence within nassau county
3858993 nassau county taxpayers will be happy to hear that this program is being funded by the nassau county police departments asset forfeiture unit
3858994 the departments asset forfeiture unit ensures that those who commit crimes do not profit from their illegal activities the proceeds and instrumentalities of criminal activities are seized and used to fund programs such as shotspotters and gunstoppers
3858995 the ability to finance new police tools and programs using criminal capital is poetic justice
3858996 using shotspotter system information nassau police not only will be able to better respond and proactively target community gun crime but target the root causes of gun violence
3858997 gun violence destroys families and ruins the lives of many individuals
3858998 nassau residents can rest assured that their county executive police department and county legislature are taking a proactive approach to eliminating illegal guns from our streets therefore ensuring their safety and the safety of their loved ones

3859154 isso um desrespeito n o s com a igreja cat lica mas com a f de um povo absurdo usar um objeto de devo o das pessoas para fazer uma coisa como essa

3859156 at other moments in our history maybe we look back and we think they were more serene but at this moment i think its very very critical for catholics to take very seriously their responsibility to be active citizens and to bring the values and the virtues of our faith into the public square and into the public debate its going to be critical in terms of how the church and other christians other believers are able to operate in this society if we are not vigilant at this moment
3859157 we cant allow ourselves to be intimidated by them and we need to exercise our rights and our freedom of speech
3859158 because those that advocate for the freedom of speech on many many fronts when it comes to the churchs voice they try to silence it
3859159 i think that they either purposely or unintentionally confuse the issues certainly a catholic in public life should not be trying to impose doctrines of belief and faith on others so what we believe about the eucharist or what we believe about the teaching authority of the bishops or the pope these are not things that we should be attempting to enshrine in law thats what is legitimately meant about separation of church and state
3859160 but i think where the confusion comes in the politicians that i think youre referring to they bring these objections up on not issues of doctrine but of moral values which also coincide with fundamental human rights
3859161 when you talk about protecting innocent human life this is something that we need to do as human beings and the fact that the church has a voice on this issue and a position on this issue doesnt mean its an imposing of our beliefs or values anymore than the effort to break down segregation by the church was an effort to impose some kind of religious doctrine on the culture or society but it was us standing up for a fundamental human right
3859162 unfortunately for a catholic theres no choice in public life to stand for certain of these issues and if they cant be retained in office then they shouldnt want to be retained in office if thats what is going to have to be compromised to do it

3859171 im not going to sit here and tell you ive got it down ive got about just enough plays down to run those plays saturday how it turns out i have no idea i hope it turns out well

3859174 during the heat of the cold war red ghost acted as the soviet foil to the fantastic four if his obsession to land on the moon before the americans wasnt ambitious enough for this balding bolshevik he turned himself into a living phantom capable of becoming intangible at will completing his transition into a serious scourge of super villainy were talking about a guy who makes up for his lack of strength and raw power by having a crew of super apes do his dirty work you hear that super apes sweet
3859175 this mad scientist and would be conqueror ruled the microverse with an iron glove however setting his sights on bigger literally goals he attempted to take over the main marvel universe the ff were there to stop him every time however when teamed with the hate monger he managed to forever cement his place as one of the first familys top 10 villain by fundamentally changing one of the members temporarily transforming sue storm into the frightful foe malice breaking free of his control sue defeated the psycho man and declared that she was no longer the invisible girl but the invisible woman having come into her own powerful self
3859176 two words fantastic one forget the ff the got all their powers in one body oh and he can shapeshift makes the dude kinda hard to beat if you cant even figure out who he is its just too bad the guys so loyal to his silly skrull emperor with all the awesome abilities hes got he could surely conquer and rule some puny planetoid somewhere all on his own
3859177 he might be short and ugly but to underestimate this subterranean ruler would be an immense mistake mole man controls legions of deviant monsters subject to his every whim not to mention hes no slouch in the brains department so you got an old guy who lives underground by himself and commands hideous monsters while plotting world domination creeeeeeepy
3859178 ah good old fashioned world domination you dont see much of that anymore these days most of the villains have ideals or heroic streaks or some other lame wholesome attribute but not the puppet master world domination was his game and his plan was to toy with the ff to get it literally and although his goal was a little clich d you have to give him some creative points for his method sculptures made out of radioactive clay that allow you to control the sculptees now thats fun and disturbing
3859179 so hes got his own undersea kingdom hes declared war on the surface world any number of times and he even joined up with dr doom once or twice no big deal the real reason namor deserves a place on this list hes got the hots for sue storm and youd better believe that doesnt sit well with reed richards it takes one heck of a guy in one tiny speedo to make the smartest man alive act like a jealous high school kid
3859180 this guys name is derived directly from the word annihilate let that sink in for a bit okay now imagine that person as a giant insectoid wielding an all powerful cosmic control rod and he isnt just some bad guy bent on total world domination oh no annihilus already rules an entire universe called the negative zone he wants more its enough to run chills down your spin
3859181 when youre hungry you go to the fridge right grab a snack and youre all set galactus our homeboy in the purple and blue cosmic toga has to nosh on planets to quiet his rumbling tummy and for big g earth is just another dish on the menu a fact that has put him squarely at odds with the ff time and again nobodys gonna eat earth on the ffs watch
3859182 doctor doom epitomizes everything great about marvel villains some see him as a selfish tyrant motivated by jealousy warped by his own ambition and desire to destroy reed richards others see him as a misunderstood man one who rules latveria with an iron fist for the good of the land and its people as he realizes what the country needs to keep it safe some see him as both but no matter how you see him hes infinitely compelling is there any story not made better by doctor doom

3859196 her education troubled us we know that shes extremely bright shes radicalized we knew that she had been planning or at least involved in the planning of a wide variety of different operations whether they involved weapons of mass destruction or research into chemical or biological weapons whether it was a possible attempt on the life of the president
3859197 we knew that she was involved with a great deal and we had to bring her into custody
3859198 what she described as units and what we would call cells
3859199 were proud of our role as americas first line of defense against foreign animal diseases
3859200 were equally proud of our safety record not once in our nearly 50 years of operation has an animal pathogen escaped from the island

3859203 her medical condition is that she was shot in the abdomen there are stitches that run from the breast plate area down to the belly button area layers and layers of tissue have been sewn sutured we have heard reports that she has lost a kidney we dont know if those are accurate but we are concerned about that there has been intestinal damage part of the intestines we understand have been removed

3859206 i believe that customers expect me to have a wide range of books on various topics without any personal biases of the book buyer
3859207 often people will want to read about different points of view and differing philosophies than their own it would be foolish of the bookstore to select only books that would appeal to only one segment of the population and exclude others
3859208 to sum up a bookstore should be a place that welcomes every person who walks in the door no one should feel unwelcome because of their beliefs whether liberal or conservative gay or straight christian or muslim every person should be able to find books that are appealing to them a particular agenda of the bookstore or book buyer should never be evident to the customers
3859209 our customers expect us to raise political issues and to be involved in community issues
3859210 we have heard from some customers that when we take a side we are not representing them or that it is too much in their face however for the entire time we have sold over 64 000 bush countdown clocks we have only received a handful of negative reactions so we feel as though we have served our community well as a retailer creating one item that brings in over 500 000 in sales is smart business as well as smart politics
3859211 said something that has always comforted and inspired me when someone hated a book that she loved or vice versa shed respond well thats why there are so many books in the world so not everyone has to like the same ones that gets a little heavier when political and ethical issues are the content of those books but from a retail perspective i think the concept is solid
3859212 are well known as liberals and in fact one of our conservative customers refers to us as the flamers but he comes back in because as a place of business we make him feel welcome we also bill ourselves not jokingly at all as hamiltons non judgmental bookstore we have conservatives buying liberal books and the converse as well probably under the know your enemies rubric we dont comment we dont judge people have their own reasons for buying what they buy and that extends to literary fluff health books and other sensitive areas sometimes including humor to exclude conservative books is to exclude liberal customers who are curious or otherwise motivated to read such viewpoints and vice versa

3859366 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3859367 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3859368 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3859369 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3859370 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3859371 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3859372 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3859373 there was some interest in converting syngas into ethanol during the first oil crisis back in the 70s
3859374 the problem was that catalysis technology at that time didnt allow selectivity in the byproducts they could produce ethanol but youd also get methane aldehydes and a number of other undesirable products
3859375 if we can increase this activated co adsorption on the surface of the catalyst it improves the opportunity for the formation of ethanol molecules
3859376 and if we can increase the amount of surface area for the catalyst we can increase the amount of ethanol produced
3859377 gasification to ethanol has received increasing attention as an attractive approach to reaching the federal renewable fuel standard of 36 billion gallons of biofuel
3859378 the great thing about using syngas to produce ethanol is that it expands the kinds of materials that can be converted into fuels
3859379 you can use the waste product from the distilling process or any number of other sources of biomass such as switchgrass or wood pulp basically any carbon based material can be converted into syngas and once we have syngas we can turn that into ethanol

3859381 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3859382 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3859383 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3859384 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3859385 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

3859401 the u s food and drug administration and other health organizations around the world have concluded that msg is safe

3859515 the idea that working with the kernel community is hard to me is a myth or at least a misconception
3859516 whenever you step into a large organized operation there are going to be some ground rules and if you ignore those rules you will find working with the community very hard
3859517 my goal was driven by talking with folks that wished they had something they could hand out to companies and developers to see how to participate and get their code into the kernel
3859518 there is a lot of disagreement between the kernel development community and certain vendors who dont see the reasons or the need to incorporate their code
3859519 one reason is that code in the mainline kernel tends to be higher quality code
3859520 there are persistent concerns about quality control with some people feeling that were spending too much time merging new stuff into the kernel and perhaps not enough time fixing stuff that is already there
3859521 thats not a universally held opinion and its really hard to come up with objective metrics on whether the kernel is becoming more buggy or less so
3859522 its important to be able to identify where all electronic copies of information sits in your organisation whether on tape at an offsite disaster recovery site or even in a third party solution like salesforce com
3859523 there is going to be increasing pushback from industry to get access to the data locked in these third party silos
3859524 legal teams in particular need to be aware of the ongoing data deletion and preservation processes inside the business
3859525 the u s courts in particular have taken a dim view against organisations who continue with these types of automatic data deletion despite impending proceedings
3859526 because digital storage is relatively cheap people tend to keep everything this can be problematic in a legal sense because there may be documents you could have deleted that are now disadvantageous to your case
3859527 people hold onto things because it could be information that someone is going to thank you for keeping down the track but you could be the villain if it becomes the subject of e discovery
3859528 the it department and legal teams are not known to be groups in day to day contact but they will need to strengthen their links going forward
3859529 lawyers shouldnt have to become geeks to move forward with e discovery and technologists shouldnt have to think as defensively as lawyers

3859554 stop action on a draft regulation that could undermine a state law that requires hospitals to provide emergency contraception in the emergency room to rape survivors
3859555 the bush administration wants to require all recipients of aid under federal health programs to certify that they will not refuse to hire nurses and other providers who object to abortion and even certain types of birth control
3859556 the proposed regulation which confuses the definitions of abortion and birth control would allow health care corporations to refuse to provide many commonly used forms of birth control including emergency contraception that minnesota hospitals are currently required to provide to rape survivors who request it in the emergency room
3859557 let us remember that our legislature and our governor did not leave rape victims without relief but stepped up and provided the kind support and protection that rape victims need as they work to put their lives together after an assault
3859558 while many may argue the various aspects of the language of dhhs proposed rules we want to stand firm and say that victims survivors of sexual assault should not be pawns in this debate
3859559 i think that this has the potential of being a very large distraction

3859564 indeed it is fascinating to us that brod is interested in speaking about womens issues
3859565 womens bodies are worthy of respect from men from women both will be impossible to achieve if womens rights to self determination are legislated away by politicians who think they know better
3859566 which brings us back to al who has been inviting us to call him al for nearly a year he and his family have warmly embraced us two neighborhood coffee shop feminists who are so grass roots that you might find mud between our toes not to seek our support or to tell us anything he just wants to listen when it comes to respecting and protecting women a willingness to listen to actual women is the perspective we trust most of all
3859567 the royal navy will not be participating in the quadrilateral exercise
3859568 it would be highly inappropriate to do so in current circumstances

3859575 did kenny fix your toilet because i can take a look at it if you want me to
3859576 no more bubbles but i like the bubbles its funny when they come up
3859577 our aim was to find a player that could make a difference and dictate the tempo of our team
3859578 in the end we managed to bring dan dickau to avellino he is a serious professional with nba experience we have nothing to envy of any other playmaker that arrived in italy this year
3859579 by signing flip it provides us with another experienced player who has the ability to play multiple positions for us
3859580 because of his versatility he will be a valuable asset for us as a reserve and we look forward to the contributions hell bring this season

3859585 reuters is deeply disturbed by a conclusion that would severely curtail the freedom of the media to cover the conflict by effectively giving soldiers a free hand to kill without being sure that they were not firing on journalists
3859586 people have donated a couple hundred dollars to help with his expenses it surprises me how much people cared about him
3859587 he said give me the money and sam said what money then he started shooting
3859588 he didnt give him a chance to get money he didnt even try to get into the store he shot like three or four times
3859589 i came through all the time and we joked and talked he was really a nice guy
3859590 he knew my wife and kids hed give the kids a piece of candy when they didnt have any money
3859591 he was an honest guy hard worker never drank never smoked

3859595 we dont value their aid projects and we dont think they are working for the progress of our country
3859596 aid organizations and their staff have been subject to increasing attacks threats and intimidation by both insurgent and criminal groups this year
3859597 this situation has forced many aid agencies to restrict the scale and scope of their development and humanitarian operations
3859598 increasing and spreading insecurity is jeopardizing the delivery of essential humanitarian assistance
3859599 the russians just shot down the government command nets so they could cover their incursion
3859600 this was really one of the first aspects of a coordinated military action that had cyber as a lead force instead of sending in air planes we need to figure out a way not only see the attack coming but to block it and in blocking it chase it home
3859601 i think this is a very poor time to send a signal that the united states is not interested in focusing on warfighting in the cyber domain
3859602 no child should have to go though something like this they are playing with toys they shouldnt be harmed because of it
3859603 there was no way i was going to buy my children a toy again
3859604 this bill represents the most significant improvements to product safety since congress created the cpsc in the 1970s
3859605 congress responded to the wishes of parents and children all across america and passed legislation that will help restore our confidence in the safety of our toys and everyday products
3859606 god has blessed us with our son being ok and now gave me a tool to say we need to have this stopped
3859607 its not ok for lead to be in childrens toys
3859608 from our conversations with our international counterparts in new york milan and paris it has become clear that they do not recognize the need for an international health certificate
3859609 we designed warhead to be more accessible for gamers new to the crysis franchise
3859610 it is a game with a story that can stand on its own it has been optimized to run better on a wider range of pcs and we are introducing crysis wars a tailor made experience for multiplayer gamers within the crysis universe all at a great value
3859611 we are notably encouraged by the prospects of aecons road building operations in light of the c 6 2 billion infrastructure framework agreement recently signed by the governments of canada and ontario

3859617 we look forward to working with eidos on expanding dc comics world renowned character batman in the game space with a noticeably different feature set in an incredibly dark interactive environment
3859618 well i suppose it was okay except he kept referring to roberta as roberto
3859619 we hope that your rules and wisdom choke you now we are one in everlasting peace
3859620 clark gregg who directed the movie version of choke that comes out in november he knew that id written choke while listening to radioheads 1993 debut album pablo honey with creep over and over and over
3859621 clark got radiohead to contribute a song to write a song for the very end of the movie the final credits

3859623 difficult because they are bigger they are stronger and they force us to do a lot of turnovers
3859624 but i think we did ok we scored 76 points which is ok for us and they didnt score 100 points they were expecting to beat us like 60 points or more

3859630 use what you got and a little help dont hurt to make the best of what you got
3859631 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
3859632 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
3859633 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
3859634 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
3859635 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
3859636 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
3859637 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
3859638 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
3859639 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
3859640 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
3859641 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
3859642 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
3859643 advertising on google com is contextual requires no personally identifiable information is not provided by a third party and does not collect any information in addition to the basic information collected to provide search results
3859644 but unfortunately the service is not free torrentprivacy currently has three payment options 2 95 per week 9 95 per month and 99 95 per year i guess its up to you whether you think its worth it or not
3859645 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
3859646 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
3859647 the mental world of brands mind memory and brand success
3859648 i like to help people but im here to follow my dreams
3859649 an unprecedented opportunity for a community that is underrepresented on television
3859650 we applaud tyra banks and the cw for making this historic visibility of transgender people possible
3859651 the relative risks of mental health problems are no greater than the risks among women who deliver an unplanned pregnancy
3859652 we are bound by the settlement agreement at this time
3859653 new york gave me my words and my music and rock and roll gave me a place for that music to live
3859654 there really isnt a more fitting spot for this museum than new york the hometown of hall of famers like the velvet underground paul simon and blondie this is where ed sullivan met the beatles where lou reed took a walk on the wild side
3859655 but the things that validate me as a writer arent going to be the money or the number of translations or printed copies
3859656 i always wrote to entertain myself that was always my goal to educate and have fun and to fill my evenings
3859657 it was a lovely lovely place to grow up and there was a premium on education there
3859658 i will say i had an exceptional high school english teacher i had always written but it was in her class that i really came to understand how much i loved both reading and writing
3859659 at the time that i started this i had already been doing research on the treatment of severe burn survivors for no real reason other than i found the medical aspects of it fascinating
3859660 id been carrying around a story idea for many years about how could i start a relationship with that feeling and these things all came together and i thought id take it to the most literal level where theres an actual burn
3859661 youre thinking ok this is the next journey this is the next thing that im going to learn about
3859662 whether i have a publishing deal or dont have a publishing deal my life was going down a good path anyway i was already happy
3859663 in a sentence i can sum it up theyre good people and i was well loved
3859664 but they were proud of me before the great story to sell would be this instant success where it turns my life around but before this i think they were always just happy that i was living a life that i enjoyed
3859665 i have an idea about what im doing for the next book and ive got hundreds of pages of notes already taken
3859666 but that really doesnt mean that i have any idea about what its going to be about at this point
3859667 i want to live a happy life with lots of interesting experiences
3859668 the work that a person leaves behind thats not their life and i am paraphrasing leonard cohen here but he talks about that being the evidence of a life if life burns properly its the ashes left behind
3859669 and i love doing the work and it is a big part of who i am but it is not thats not it it is the totality
3859670 its not just music for the united states its world music
3859671 im touching so many different kinds of people on this album as well as keeping my core fan base at the same time
3859672 its totally given me a new energy a new everything
3859673 when you have a lot of stress and negativity around you when you cut that away you cleanse im starting over basically
3859674 i want people to say its breath of fresh air from everything thats out there
3859675 its still going to be me and what they know me for but its still going to be newer
3859676 with my fan base being broader and larger now im looking to somewhere where somebody can really take advantage of that and take it to the next level
3859677 this was simply a murderous act against humanitarian workers committed individuals who were there to assist the people of afghanistan
3859678 these extraordinary individuals were deeply committed to aiding the people of afghanistan especially the children who have seen so much strife
3859679 they were not working for the interests of afghanistan and they belonged to those countries whose forces took afghanistans freedom
3859680 they were clearly not military personnel and this is a major concern not only to us but to all those who are in the humanitarian community in afghanistan
3859681 she was utterly compassionate she was giving she was courageous and she was very very good at her work
3859682 the irc provides life saving humanitarian assistance to those most affected by the conflict and it is reprehensible that such selfless individuals working for the most vulnerable communities should be deliberately targeted
3859683 we face a growing humanitarian challenge in afghanistan and all parties to this conflict must recognize and respect the inherent neutrality and independence of the humanitarian assistance being provided to those afghans who need our help the most

3859700 racist assumptions that take away the self esteem and strengths of our children
3859701 if you are going to treat me like a criminal i might as well act like one
3859702 ive lost three clients in the last month and a half
3859703 theyve told me quite honestly they just couldnt justify the expense they couldnt keep me
3859704 our investment in this new e signature capability is indicative of our belief that service in our industry must be transformed to maximize a firms success and deliver a great experience for end clients
3859705 to be a person is to have a story to tell
3859706 i lost the plot for a while then and i lost the subplot the script the soundtrack the intermission my popcorn the credits and the exit sign
3859707 i woke up from my coma dont worry not that you were worried anyway

3859710 for much of the world water reuse is going to become a fact of life the orange county project is a model for the world
3859711 when you have a precious resource like water you have to do everything you can to protect it
3859712 technologically its almost trivial for us to do this now the key is to get public acceptance and political buy in
3859713 we talked to just about anyone who would listen to us
3859714 and it paid dividends because we had no opposition to the project
3859715 the process does not make up for not conserving water in other ways
3859716 we live in a desert but people take it for granted that we have all the water we need thats just not the case
3859717 has sold the device at its smaller network of apple shops and at at amp t retail stores with 1 million of the new iphones sold in their first weekend in july
3859718 i gave these a b because it does what it says it will in terms of preserving your fruit and vegetables a little longer but it didnt make that much of a difference these bags kept my bananas fresh for about four to five days longer than a traditional bag and for about a week longer than no bag at all the strawberries made it three days longer in the green bags than with the plastic carton they came in after two weeks i noticed no real difference in my lettuce or tomatoes they do keep things fresher but not by such a huge margin that its worth my extra money for the bags
3859719 debbie meyer firmly stands by her product debbie meyer greenbags
3859720 i ended up giving this a c because they said you could make a coffee handle so i tried that and it broke right off it did a good job in terms of connecting two irrigation pipes and it worked and prevented water seepage but it didnt give me a lot of confidence it didnt seem to be a money saver for me i used the putty to make a handle for my coffee cup but even after allowing the putty to harden completely the handle came off the cup and my mug broke
3859721 mighty putty is an effective and powerful bonding epoxy stick the formula has been used successfully for over 10 years the instructions state that the product must be mixed for two minutes until it is a white color and must be allowed to fully cure for up to 24 hours when the instructions on the package are followed mighty putty is effective as advertised
3859722 i gave them a c the reason being theres a logic issue here it didnt really work on heavy objects it only worked on light objects and you dont really need the help for light objects i couldnt move a heavy chest of drawers on it at all and i tried to move my old jeep and it did not budge at all these make moving furniture on carpet easier for smaller items the moving men coasters did seem to reduce friction and make it easier for me to push or pull items into place but for really heavy things on hardwood floors i didnt get much help from the moving men and the whole point is that theyre supposed to help you move heavy things
3859723 i gave it a c the idea is that it allows you to use your computer and plug a regular phone into your computer to use the internet so it feels like youre using a regular phone overall it works ok with decent call quality with some delay and a few drop outs and its pretty easy to get it up and running the average phone bill for u s residents is 40 a month using the magic jack you pay 40 for the product plus 6 95 for shipping and handling which includes a year of free local and long distance calling to u s and canadian numbers after that its 20 a year so its technically cheaper than a landline the cons if youre the kind of person like me who doesnt want to miss a call and want them to go to voice mail you would have to pay the electricity costs to keep your computer on and that could raise your bill the 911 function is a little confusing to set up if you dont set up 911 the dispatcher wont know your address if you call it just didnt seem to measure up to what they promise
3859724 this decision was made as part of an ongoing strategic review of our portfolio and enables us to maintain our strong and stable financial performance by further paying down debt
3859725 we will continue to own and operate industry leading companies invest in existing businesses and maintain a level of financial discipline that ensures we are well positioned for ongoing success
3859726 we have seen that airtrans presence in this market has greatly increased the usage of the wichita airport by people from outside this area and also provided dramatically lower airfares
3859727 the acquisition is another building block in nortels vision to be a software centric company and the leading provider of unified communications solutions

3859729 he came in and went into this office and started shooting
3859730 our hearts go out to everyone at the democratic headquarters what a tragedy
3859731 this is just a very upsetting troubling and scary thing for our staff as well
3859732 for 63 years i had no reason to believe i would ever find out what happened to my father
3859733 i virtually had no hope of ever knowing what happened to my dad
3859734 i wouldnt say ive processed it i think im still a little shell shocked by it all
3859735 i think they kind of grasp what is going on
3859736 i dont know that the military even looked for him
3859737 i guess they figured he was gone and thats about it
3859738 were definitely in fear mode in the market this is a classic correction
3859739 youre going to get this sort of fear activity when theres very little conviction
3859740 this is a very difficult market in terms of processing news and trying to guess what is positive and what is negative
3859741 the way through this is to try to look at everything a little bit further down the road and just buckle up because its going to be a pretty wild ride
3859742 the demand is bad so why store a product that youre going to have trouble selling
3859743 weve got a good sized rally but it still doesnt feel like its sustainable were not seeing the frenzy of buying that we would have seen a couple months ago
3859744 i think the true underlying demand weakness is still out there
3859745 i dont think people are going to change their commuting habits that fast
3859746 russias objections to the sites have never been based on anything more than trying to define a sphere of influence in europe and on the territory of existing nato members
3859747 senator mccain believes that is unacceptable especially in the aftermath of russias brutal invasion of georgia
3859748 congress will not and should not fund a system until testing has proven that it works and that testing will not be completed until 2010 at the earliest
3859749 russias actions represent compelling data that should be convincing to democrats that we dont want to delay this thing
3859750 this is not just about missile defense this is about demonstrating to russia that america is still a nation of resolve and were not going to let russian expansionism intimidate everyone
3859751 what you have is an attempt to conflate the third site issue with russias provocation in the caucasus and theyre completely unrelated
3859752 russias primary concern was that we were exaggerating the iranian threat and therefore these sites in europe must be directed at them and weve gone a long way to try to dissuade them of that notion
3859753 this historic russian fear of encirclement is very much alive at the moment
3859754 today its much more probable than a few weeks ago that the american side will take into consideration the proposition of my government
3859755 i dont mean to sound dramatic here but i think this is the most dramatic foreign policy event since sept 11
3859756 this will fundamentally change how countries think about how theyre going to provide security in the decades ahead
3859757 set a whole new direction for the west and nato in terms of relations with russia
3859758 i think they will find that this is one point where russias really not going to back down
3859759 if it was good for kosovo to become independent why would it not be good for south ossetia to become independent
3859760 they see him with some justification as sort of a western installed puppet somebody who is always going to be an enemy and who is in a crucial strategic spot for them
3859761 theres a feeling natos been on the offensive for years so this is about reversing the losses
3859762 they really do see america as treating them as an enemy eight years ago when u
3859763 i think russias given up trying to integrate with the west
3859764 every image counts for a presidential candidate and his campaign handlers dont want to give critics any photo fodder that could be used against him
3859765 based on his votes in the senate the answer to that is yes
3859766 the question becomes will the pro life movement be able to persuade him otherwise between now and the election
3859767 wed be hopeful that hed leave bushs policy in place
3859768 more than half of them had hoped to vote in the last presidential election
3859769 we urge the fbi to be transparent about the reasons to obtain the records with such urgency and secrecy
3859770 we urged the bureau to refrain from using similar procedures in the future improper monitoring of reporters is harmful to a free press and undermines the free flow of information
3859771 this has been in our financial plan for some time
3859772 power plant modifications must include required emissions controls to protect public health and the environment
3859773 your conduct thus precipitated a horrendously tragic event which has impacted many individuals
3859774 the governor absolutely must deliver the resources needed to make this mandate succeed
3859775 from my perspective its too early to put a price tag on these efforts and more critical to identify the elements of the plan i do think that we have had better conversations about algebra and math readiness in the last 20 days than weve had in the last 20 years
3859776 he was living with complete structure for 22 years every minute of every day was structured you give a person like that 80 000 someone who is bitter with reason and its not a particularly good recipe for getting back into connection with life
3859777 he hopes this will help start the healing process for himself and all of the victims
3859778 it had no ball marker and were going to prove that the tower could not be seen
3859779 these pilots basically got lost and didnt know where they were
3859780 i appreciate your concern but i really cannot say anything right now
3859781 it is typical procedure for the supreme court to decide the big legal questions and to leave it to the lower courts to do the housekeeping
3859782 having said that were going to do everything we can to bring this to a quick and expeditious close
3859783 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
3859784 extensive connections to islam and questions whether obamas admitted dabbling with drugs in high school and college ever ended
3859785 this 11th hour ruling from the bush administration is highly problematic after over 30 years of successfully protecting our nations most endangered wildlife like the bald eagle we should be looking for ways to improve it not weaken it
3859786 as president senator obama will fight to maintain the strong protections of the endangered species act and undo this proposal from president bush
