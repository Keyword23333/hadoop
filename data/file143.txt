1430152 when were you at your hottest and dont you want to go back to that
1430153 if a forester identified which trees can go perhaps residents could assist in removing them
1430154 there are many details to work out including liability safety oversight and the removal of brush
1430155 they would have to mark trees that could be cut and remove brush and debris or it could become a fire hazard
1430156 i tell you this year with the high cost of fuel people will be cutting up their living room furniture i am going to do a piece for the town newsletter about heating safety
1430157 i burn wood a lot of wood but i would not be able to take advantage of that
1430158 its an excellent idea the wood couldnt be used this winter because it would be green it wouldnt have a chance to dry out
1430159 you never know what the oil price is going to be next year wed need some sort of waiver in place
1430160 its time for congress to get to work for once to find solutions for our energy needs
1430161 americans are struggling to pay their gas bills and our representatives chose to take a vacation instead of working to fix the problem congress has failed so now the president should step up and call them back to work until we can find a resolution that begins to get the price of gas and oil down for the working families of new hampshire and across the country
1430162 president bush should reconsider and call congress back so that they can get the job done
1430163 this isnt about a political party its about values getting the price of gas down isnt a republican democrat or independent issue its about helping the american people we need to work together and at the least start having some votes on the floor we can all agree on three common goals energy independence lowering gas prices and protecting the environment everything should be on the table we need to get everyone on the same page and start to take action we cant wait any longer
1430164 im not apologizing i stand by myself 1 000 percent

1430167 we want to keep our prices reasonable because that generates volume which in turn creates jobs
1430168 forty percent of filipinos more than 30 million people live in abject poverty
1430169 we owe our growth and success to our wonderful customers and our customers like the fact that theyre helping other people and the environment when they buy our bags as well as getting a handbag that makes people stop and ask them whered you get that bag
1430170 everyones connected from the recyclers who collect our juice packs and rice sacks to the women who wear our beautiful bags and we want them all to feel like theyre benefiting you cant really be eco friendly if youre not human friendly as well anything else is just last century thinking
1430171 its a shame the nea doesnt spend as much money and effort trying to improve lousy schools as it does trying to keep taxes high
1430172 certi che la nostra identit possa dare un contributo importante al cambiamento in atto in italia
1430173 il sondaggio odierno del corriere della sera spiega che di fronte al prevedibile aumento di consensi al pdl non un elettore de la destra si ritrova nelle politiche di governo
1430174 nellunico movimento che rappresenta i valori in cui ho sempre creduto e che con la confluenza di an nel pdl rischiavano di restare senza rappresentanza
1430175 ci stiamo tesserando siccome ci sar un congresso nazionale con la tessera potremo dire la nostra
1430176 a volte i nostri amici della lega per motivi anche territoriali sono un po folcloristici ma poi la pensano come noi
1430177 episodio che molto spiaciuto a me e credo a tutti o quasi
1430178 ma per me non cambia niente io la penso come sempre per questi non li capisco in fondo io ho sempre solo votato senza mai espormi da missino ho pensato alla professione ma qui c gente che stata perseguitata ha preso le botte perso il posto ma come fanno

1430183 il movimento sociale fiamma tricolore unorganizzazione politica ispirata ad una concezione spirituale della vita che ha il fine di garantire la dignit e gli interessi del popolo italiano nella ininterrotta continuit storica delle sue tradizioni di civilt e nella sua prospettiva di una pi vasta missione occidentale europea mediterranea
1430184 che stata e sar come disse qualcuno la pi audace la pi originale la pi mediterranea ed europea delle idee
1430185 non andremo mai nel pdl e naturalmente lo diciamo ai camerati un po ingenui meno che mai nella destra di storace siamo e resteremo fiamma tricolore
1430186 leggere certe affermazioni da parte di un ormai ex dirigente nazionale fanno veramente pensare specialmente quando si al corrente che quello che stai dicendo non e assolutamente vero
1430187 la cosiddetta destra libertaria composta dagli stessi che avevano gi tradito in campagna elettorale lunica novit che a fare compagnia ai traditori la solita nipote assieme a un deputato europeo del partito di berlusconi
1430188 siamo tutti consapevoli delle carenze dorganico delle forze dellordine e non a caso nel nostro passato programma politico si proponeva linnalzamento dei finanziamenti rivolti a tali settori
1430189 veniamo da lontano stessa sorte un solo cuore vecchia fiamma che non muore una nuova libert

1430224 life coach and founder of the synergy institute tristan loo uses his own personal story to discuss how to turn life challenges into opportunities for personal growth and development
1430225 this article is a poignant reminder of the power of your word
1430226 the word of god still answers the questions of today
1430227 here is the one whose church and whose services i would like to attend
1430228 for a long time with spiritual delight i have been listening on sunday evenings whenever possible to the sermons of father alexander his surname was never given over radio liberty
1430229 and i was amazed how genuine how truly contemporary and of what high order is his art of preaching
1430230 never a note of falsehood not an iota of rhetoric without empty recourse to obligatory form and ritual which causes a listener discomfort and embarrassment for the preacher or for himself always a deep thought and profound feeling
1430231 and then quite recently it was deciphered to me that this is father schmemann his article about me explained me to myself and also explained pushkin and why i always felt such an affinity with him
1430232 the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between political parties but right through every human heart
1430233 a moralist who defends age old distinctions between good and evil and truth and falsehood
1430234 solzhenitsyn was the most eloquent scourge of ideology in the twentieth century
1430235 by discrediting soviet communism at home and abroad this single book played an undeniable perhaps a decisive role in ending the soviet union and thus the cold war
1430236 recognizes above himself a higher power and joyfully works as a humble apprentice under gods heaven
1430237 christ was suffering acutely suffering yet not complaining his compassion was for all those who approached him and so at that moment for her
1430238 solzhenitsyn accepts the validity of a classical christian cosmology and anthropology one that has nothing in common with facile modern and postmodern belief that that universe is indifferent or even hostile to human purposes
1430239 the moral heritage of christian centuries with their great reserves of mercy and sacrifice
1430240 the west has finally achieved the rights of man and even to excess but mans responsibility to god and society has grown dimmer and dimmer
1430241 he returned with adult thoughtfulness to the christian worldview of his rearing
1430242 solzhenitsyns mature articulation of christian truths was deeply informed by his experience in the prison camps there he witnessed human nature in extremis and learned about the heights and depths of the human soul
1430243 interrogation and trial are merely judicial corroboration they cannot alter your fate which was previously decided if it is necessary to shoot you then you will be shot even if you are altogether innocent if it is necessary to acquit you then no matter how guilty you are you will be cleared and acquitted
1430244 someday our descendents will describe our several generations as generations of driveling do nothings first we submissively allowed them to massacre us by the millions and then with devoted concern we tended the murderers in their prosperous old age
1430245 for a post modernist the world does not possess values that have reality
1430246 several hundred bishops priests and monks were either shot or starved to death in prisons
1430247 many priests were arrested and a number executed among them the bishop of petrograd benjamin
1430248 nothing other than an attraction of the will towards nothing a negation of being of creation and above all of god a furious hatred of grace against which the rebellious will puts up an implacable resistance
1430249 if the soviet unions elite were to accept that the portrait of ivan denisovich was authentic that meant admitting that innocent people had endured pointless suffering
1430250 if the camps had really been stupid and wasteful and tragic that meant that the soviet union was stupid and wasteful and tragic too
1430251 now i read and weep but when i was imprisoned in ukhta for ten years i did not shed a tear
1430252 there is this belief that all those other worlds are only being temporarily prevented by wicked governments or by heavy crises or by their own barbarity or incomprehension from taking the way of western pluralistic democracy and from adopting the western way of life
1430253 it is a soothing theory which overlooks the fact that these worlds are not at all developing into similarity neither one can be transformed into the other without the use of violence
1430254 i feel that yeltsin permitted an enormous devastation of russia
1430255 millions of people associate the name and work of alexander solzhenitsyn with russias fate
1430256 his academic research outstanding literary work and in fact his entire life have been dedicated to the fatherland
1430257 french soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis

1430269 the additional lease acreage should increase our potential reserves by at least 25 which is considerably more than the recent temporary decline in gas and oil prices it is important for investors to understand that we calculate our internal forecasts using 6 natural gas and 70 oil being as though current market pricing is more than 50 higher than these bench marks we are considerably ahead of where we could otherwise be

1430278 you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and like a lot of small towns in the midwest the jobs have been gone now for 25 years and nothings replaced them and they fell through the clinton administration and the bush administration and each successive administration has said that somehow these communities are gonna regenerate and they have not

1430282 ideally wed like to develop a drug that can be administered within 12 hours of exposure and prevent deaths from what are currently fatal exposure doses of ionizing radiation
1430283 the same properties that make bha and bht good food preservatives namely their ability to scavenge free radicals also make them good candidates for mitigating the biological affects that are induced through the initial ionizing radiation event
1430284 our preliminary results are remarkable and thats why darpa awarded us this grant with a very compressed timeline for delivery nine months which is almost unheard of for an academic study of this type
1430285 they are very interested in finding out whether this will work in a post exposure delivery and they dont want to waste any time

1430297 the braves family and braves fans everywhere will sadly miss him our thoughts are with his wife paula and his children

1430302 what earlier generations held as sacred remains sacred and great for us too and it cannot be all of a sudden entirely forbidden or even considered harmful it behoves all of us to preserve the riches which have developed in the churchs faith and prayer and to give them their proper place
1430303 we welcome the foundation of the scholarly journal usus antiquior as an important initiative yet another fruit of the reinvigoration of the ancient liturgical rites in the western church begun by pope benedict xvi it will help consolidate their place in the life of the church of today and for the future not only priests seminarians and academics but anyone who wants to understand the mass and the other rites of the roman church will seek this journal out and study it

1430306 the cries for help from the first district are falling on deaf ears as congressman childers refuses to support domestic offshore drilling efforts
1430307 it appears childers is more concerned with the liberal agenda of the democratic party than the needs of the first district we need someone in congress who truly represents the district unlike childers who continues to walk the party line
1430308 since being elected to congress in the may special election childers has voted with nancy pelosi and supported her efforts to continue dependence on foreign oil in doing that he has turned his back on the entire district when he had a real opportunity to help

1430323 instead of complaining moaning and bitching which is what alonso is doing at the moment all he needs to do is concentrate on driving quicker
1430324 he is using all kinds of excuses he should have done this after the second or third race of the season after he realised how quick hamilton is he didnt do that
1430325 my worry is if he continues to find the reasons somewhere else and not in his right foot he will lose out because hamilton is doing a perfect job simply concentrating on his driving and hes quick its what alonso should do
1430326 the spaniard has to stop moaning and get on with it

1430357 termasuk persaingan antara penduduk lokal dan para pendatang biasanya warga lokal itu selalu dikalahkan oleh pendatang karena para pendatang biasanya datang dengan mental dan persiapan yang lebih matang
1430358 terutama soal mental jangan jadi manja sekarang bisa kita lihat kalau soal dagang di kota bandung didominasi oleh orang padang dan jawa sedangkan orang orang sunda sendiri lebih banyak duduk di pemerintahan daerah pemda
1430359 sebab perekrutan pegawai negeri sipil pns di kita lebih banyak karena kesamaan suku atau sistem rekrut saudara makanya posisi pns banyak diisi oleh orang orang lokal
1430360 ini disebabkan mental orang orang sunda cenderung soft atau feminin mereka tidak suka kekerasan dan senang dengan pekerjaan yang halus atau soft
1430361 makanya orang orang luar pulau jawa seperti padang medan kalimantan yang memiliki kultur yang lebih maskulin lebih banyak mengisi pekerjaan yang tak melulu di belakang meja

1430406 he feared me because he feared himself he feared that he might love me completely it was not simply terror that i should invade his study and his solitude it was terror that i might invade his heart he said that there were three preconditions for happiness stupidity selfishness and good health and that he was only sure of possessing the second of these i argued i fought but he wanted to believe that happiness was impossible it gave him some strange consolation

1430412 marrying technology with humanity in a way that is organic to the body appropriate to the spirit and sustainable to the community
1430413 that will allow this issue of human restoration and augmentation to merge into a kind of seamless unity
1430414 whats fun about having part of your body artificial is that you can upgrade its depressing to me too bad that you folks have biological limbs
1430415 the dream here is that one day i and other people with limb amputations will not only be able to walk across a sandy beach but feel the sand against their prosthesis
1430416 blowing away the notion of normal entirely and creating a completely improvisational notion of what it means to be human

1430419 gentili telespettatori vi stato raccontato che nelle altre democrazie il premier coperto da immunit bene siamo lieti di informarvi che non vero limmunit ce lha solo il nostro
1430420 sono fiero di appartenere a uno stato in cui un premier pu essere investigato come un semplice cittadino un premier non pu essere al di sopra della legge ma nemmeno al di sotto se devo scegliere fra me la consapevolezza di essere innocente e il fatto che restando al mio posto possa mettere in grave imbarazzo il paese che amo e che ho lonore di rappresentare non ho dubbi mi faccio da parte perch anche il primo ministro devessere giudicato come gli altri dimostrer che le accuse di corruzione sono infondate da cittadino qualunque errori ne ho commessi e me ne pento per la carica che occupo ero consapevole di poter finire al centro di attacchi feroci ma nel mio caso si passata la misura
1430421 la stampa israeliana terribile quando ha un pezzo di carne tra i denti difficile che lo molli neppure se si chiama olmert maariv e yedioth ahronot hanno pubblicato le deposizioni del premier parola per parola verbali devastanti per olmert dalla procura spiegano che le prove acquisite vanno ben oltre la testimonianza di talansky olmert dovr testimoniare per la quarta volta
1430422 if we train ourselves in moral reasoning and learn how to refute those who oppose universal ethics rather than say merely arguing against the minimum wage then we can really truly turn the tide of history and save not just libertarianism but the world
1430423 if his captaincy didnt make any great impression on me
1430424 in any race i go into my aim is to win so thats what im thinking
1430425 thank god it wont be like this at the next games
1430426 in london theyre lucky if it ever gets half this temperature
1430427 this is not a target but is considered to be a stretch figure as experience from previous games shows that given the very tight margins between success and failure at this level not every single medal will be won
1430428 i love it here and i want to be part of the team so im happy to have signed my new contract
1430429 everybody wants to play in europe and being in the uefa cup gives us a greater opportunity to attract great players to the club

1430431 they manchester united have had two good years and you have to stand back and take your hat off to them but we know we were good last year and we have another level to go to
1430432 i think we saw the very best of manchester united but we have got an awful lot to come
1430433 we have got improvements to make but i think united are at their peak
1430434 i dont believe there was any statement trying to be made
1430435 i would not carry it a face mask myself whether i was an athlete or not
1430436 i dont see the need for it honestly unless there are very unfavourable days and you are sensitive to such situations
1430437 i know there are investigations going on in different laboratories providing different types of devices for protection in inferior air quality
1430438 some may be better than others in their filter system whether they the americans are carrying a new generation of mask i dont know but this is not a measure i would recommend unless you know you carry some sort of disorder that can be problematic under particular circumstances
1430439 most of the smog here is evaporation its due to humidity
1430440 the who standards were never intended for guiding people who are temporary visitors
1430441 the standards are and should be used and are intended by the ioc to be guidelines for the authorities to protect the health of the residents of that area
1430442 they are for the permanent residents those standards have been established to guard against long term risks
1430443 presently there is simply no scientific basis for claims that the escalating cost of disasters is the result of anything other than increasing societal vulnerability
1430444 he has a long contract and i think he can impress and next year will be a different situation
1430445 i know i will be here for two years and olympiakos are a great team who challenge for every honour in greece and in the champions league
1430446 randy has told martin to get the players he wants and not worry about the money we all know we need more players we trust martin to know what the squad needs and to go and get the players
1430447 this is more than a business to him villa is a passion
1430448 if martin oneill came to randy and said i need 30 million for player x and the player would fit into what we are trying to do randy would have his chequebook out before martin could get past the players name
1430449 additionally he will be equally ready to fund the other players that martin says he needs randy has never said no to martin
1430450 randy is in it for the long term he wants europe he wants winning football he wants entertainment for the fans

1430466 for a few weeks every four years nations around the world put aside their differences and focus on the excitement and drama of olympic competition

1430470 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1430471 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1430472 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate
1430473 we hope the sides will manage to find compromise decisions that will promote the removal of tensions in the region
1430474 if events develop in the worst possible way with the use of force russia will not be able to stand by seeing as russian citizens live in south ossetia
1430475 with the help of the united nations we reached a new phrasing for article 24 which was agreed by the kurds and accepted by some of the other mps
1430476 we were surprised by the objections of some other members
1430477 kurds are for the distribution of authority in kirkuk but not equally dividing it
1430478 the division of power should come from the election results
1430479 if we want to reach a convincing result concerning kirkuk this might take a long time and affect the elections
1430480 so we said lets not cripple the country altogether and let the elections go ahead in all provinces while postponing them in kirkuk until consultations are completed
1430481 real ale is a natural living product so there is a much greater intensity of flavours
1430482 one of our objectives is to get people to try it there are fruit beers wheat beers porters stouts milds and golden ales its incredibly diverse so theres something to meet everyones tastes
1430483 pasteurising and filtering a beer kills off a lot of the natural flavours
1430484 a processed keg beer is completely inert a dead flat liquid drawn up to bar with carbon dioxide to put some life in it thats why theyre so fizzy compared to a real ale

1430487 we have not yet read the report which has not been sent to us by the rwandan government we are therefore not in a position to react
1430488 french forces directly assassinated tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis french forces committed several rapes on tutsi survivors
1430489 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1430490 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1430491 they clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1430492 under senator mccains plan the oil companies get billions more we dont pay any less at the pump and we stay in the same cycle of dependence on oil that got us into this crisis
1430493 the oil companies have placed their bet on senator mccain and if he wins they will continue to cash in while our families and our economy suffer and our future is put in jeopardy
1430494 unfortunately in this election senator mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1430495 senator obama has said that expanding our nuclear power plants doesnt make sense for america
1430496 if we want to enable the technologies of tomorrow like plug in electric cars we need electricity to plug into
1430497 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1430498 it underscores that barack obama isnt being straightforward with voters and has the bad judgment americans cant afford right now
1430499 so hawker brownlow saw the potential for our ati products in that market this business relationship will introduce these products to new international english speaking markets
1430500 we are tremendously excited about our agreement with ets assessment is a hot topic in australia at this time and the addition of the ets range of assessment titles will be met with great enthusiasm by our teachers and administrators

1430502 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1430503 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1430504 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1430505 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1430506 the funding announced today to the municipality of alleyn et cawood under the gas tax fund agreement is a concrete example of the government of canadas commitment to support a stronger economy a cleaner environment and more prosperous communities in quebec
1430507 in the governments 33 billion building canada plan the gas tax fund will provide 11 8 billion nationally from 2007 until 2014 budget 2008 announced that the gas tax fund will become permanent beyond 2013 14 at 2 billion per year this ensures municipalities continue to have access to a reliable source of funds as they get on with building the infrastructure they need
1430508 the funding announced today is a reflection of our commitment to improve the quality of life of residents this means the municipality of alleyn et cawood will now be able to rely on stable funding which will facilitate the planning of the work that needs to be done another proof that the government of quebec recognizes the importance of the sustainability of infrastructure is the recent announcement of the extension of quebecs contribution of 1 15 billion for the period ending in march 2015 these investments are part of the plan quebecois des infrastructures that foresees an investment of 30 billion for the 2007 2012 period of which 3 15 billion will be used to maintain and improve municipal infrastructure the repair and modernization of public infrastructure is a priority for the government of quebec

1430536 ive worked all my life and paid my national insurance and tax and now asked to pay for my treatment why should we have to pay scotland and wales dont our government should say these people have cancer they need this treatment give it to them
1430537 for example mrs vaughn may be able to save money by getting a prescription pre payment certificate

1430540 our public transportation is a public good i know its not terribly efficient at the moment but we have the opportunity to do much more it would be a tragedy to get rid of the t during a time when people are so vulnerable and in need we can make it better as long as we have it if you feel like youre hurting because of gas prices please consider those who wont have any recourse if we eliminate our bus system there are zero property tax dollars allocated for public transportation in the city budget adopted last week by a 4 1 vote if the sales tax vote proposed for november does not pass there will be no public transportation system in lawrence

1430543 we are very pleased with the results so far as the drilling indicates parallel veins that have excellent mining widths show strong continuity and are high grade in value when we achieve our near term target of 1 3 million gold equivalent ounces our longer term stated target of 2 million gold equivalent ounces may increase based on our better understanding of the el aguila propertys potential
1430544 we will continue exploration drilling beyond our current delineation focus to determine what the actual size and extent of mineralization might be at the arista deposit but it is very exciting to see the potential for arista areas not yet drilled to have the possibility to double in vertical extent and equally also double the lateral extent of these veins in addition to the arista deposit potential there are 4 or 5 additional high grade veins in the immediate arista area such as the aire vein the many geomagnetic anomalies on this project yet to be tested and the remaining exploration potential on the 95 of the el aguila projects land concession that has not yet been explored
1430545 with the soon to be completed initial definition of mineralized material drilled at a portion of the arista deposit we will have the basis to begin our underground mine design our goal is to begin driving the decline for the arista deposits underground mine at the same time as we begin to generate cash flow from our first 12 months of production at the aguila projects high grade open pit and we are particularly excited to begin a broader exploration program to see just how large the mineralization at the aguila project could be
1430546 in 2011 2015 we are planning to put into service over 100 new mi 28n night hunter and ka 52 alligator attack helicopters and mi 8mtb5 hip multi purpose helicopters

1430573 most reports agree that fuel cell vehicles will reach the commercial market with hundreds of thousands of vehicles in the 2017 2025 timeframe
1430574 it can be difficult to see how we move from todays 200 fcvs and 25 limited access stations to a commercial market this document provides a clear vision of how that transition can occur
1430575 some companies will enter each phase a little sooner or later
1430576 moving towards a hydrogen future has clear benefits for the environment and the economy
1430577 to achieve commercialization california needs to establish a network of early hydrogen fuel stations focused in key early markets although the benefits may not be fully realized for years to come it is time to take the next step toward this transition now

1430798 these leaders of the blind are unwilling to see that
1430799 there has been no definitive success in differentiating the emotions on the basis of physiology
1430800 even if each emotion were linked to different physical reactions it would not prove that the non cognitive approach was correct this would only show that different cognitions have different physiological reactions
1430801 from our knowledge of neuroscience the brain structures used for emotion and cognition cannot be readily separated
1430802 if emotion is cognitive love is about something can be commanded and is emotional
1430803 stresses the unreliable nature of emotion and the need for it to be controlled by reason
1430804 underscores the need to change harmful emotions by correcting false beliefs
1430805 we have been told that gods emotions were anthropomorphisms described like those of humans in reality human emotions are in the image of god himself
1430806 they who would deny that much of true religion lies in the affections and maintain the contrary must throw away what we have been wont to own for our bible and get some other rule by which to judge of the nature of religion
1430807 many others have agreed by defining love in non emotional terms this has often been in response to trying to answer the question of how love can be commanded this is also a prevalent misconception on old testament studies
1430808 whereas the james lange theory implied that each emotion must have a unique physical manifestation experimental evidence points to the fact that there are identical physical responses for different emotions
1430809 we feel sorry because we cry angry because we strike afraid because we tremble
1430810 the fact that these things are commanded is not disputed what is at issue is 1 are emotions actually commanded in these passages and 2 what do these commands mean in practice the burden of proof is upon those who would argue that these are not commands of emotion the meaning seems very straightforward whether or not we believe it is logical to command emotion the simplest interpretation of these passages is that the biblical writers do in fact command emotion there is no evidence from the texts themselves that these terms have been redefined by the writers as theological concepts that do not contain an emotional core on the contrary the evidence points to these words retaining their usual meanings of simple emotions the arguments of those who deny that emotion can be commanded seem to come from a desire to be consistent with their own philosophical understanding of emotion and at the same time maintain the integrity of the writers of the new testament we must challenge the tenability of this position

1430830 rnl bio is commencing its worldwide services with booger as its first successful clone

1430834 johnson wrote to us to say he considered the medal was not won honestly and he was returning it
1430835 its a way of poking fun at calvinists who place too much importance on this doctrine as if it were at the heart of the gospel itself
1430836 christs sacrifice was intended both to provide salvation for all and to procure salvation for all who believe
1430837 christs redeeming work was intended to save the elect only all those who believe and actually secured salvation for them
1430838 the issue is not whether everyone is actually saved but whether the sacrifice of jesus made salvation available to all
1430839 the atonement is both unlimited in its extent and limited in its application
1430840 the doctrine of the atonement must be radically revised if as atonement it applies to those who finally perish as well as to those who are the heirs of eternal life in that event we should have to dilute the grand categories in terms of which the scripture defines the atonement
1430841 upon these expressions hangs the whole weight of the opposite cause the chief if not the only argument for the universality of redemption
1430842 whosoever meets the requirements for enrollment to sbts as well as the requirements for discounts on tuition will be able to receive such benefits
1430843 the death of jesus removed sin and satisfied gods holy anger
1430844 i have my own private opinion that there is no such thing as preaching christ and him crucified unless we preach what nowadays is called calvinism it is a nickname to call it calvinism calvinism is the gospel and nothing else
1430845 the basic message without which no one can be saved the incarnation death burial and ressurrection of jesus christ
1430846 for if by the transgression of the one death reigned through the one much more those who receive the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the one jesus christ so then as through one transgression there resulted condemnation to all men even so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men for as through the one mans disobedience the many were made sinners even so through the obedience of the one the many will be made righteous the law comes in so that the transgression would increase but where sin increased grace abounded all the more so that as sin reigned in death even so grace would reign through righteousness to eternal life through jesus christ our lord
1430847 the only name under heaven by which we may be saved
1430848 i believe the word all in this context means x and here is why
1430849 one does this and in the same way the other does that
1430850 however this understanding does not necessitate that ch 5 is teaching limited atonement
1430851 so through one act of righteousness there resulted justification of life to all men
1430852 i hold a universal reading for both instances of the word all in this verse
1430853 but scripture further qualifies that with the condition of faith meaning as it seems we agree only those who believe are actually atoned for
1430854 everyone without exception with the exception of those who do not believe
1430855 for starters doesnt the first usage of the word directly determine the context of the second
1430856 who are israelites but it is not as though the word of god has failed for they are not all israel who are of israel
1430857 why do i call myself a nigger you ask me i guess its the way shit has to be
1430858 i said i see all types of people the voice said but do you see any niggers i said no it said do you know why cause there arent any
1430859 we understand it might be beneath a worldwide celebrity of barack obamas magnitude to appear at town hall meetings alongside john mccain and directly answer questions from the american people but we hope hell reconsider
1430860 it is a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1430861 and it is a completely frivolous way to choose the next president of the united states
1430862 we think its got a lot of humor in it were having fun and enjoying it

1430866 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1430867 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1430868 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1430869 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1430870 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1430871 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1430872 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1430873 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1430874 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1430875 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1430876 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1430877 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1430878 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1430879 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1430880 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1430881 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1430882 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1430883 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1430884 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1430885 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies

1430943 unless discrimination against women and girls is addressed as part of overall strategies to improve child and maternal health high rates of maternal and child mortality will remain stubbornly entrenched
1430944 the allegations made in the times article are simply not true there was no deal never mind a deal preventing the uk military from entering basra
1430945 i have the greatest confidence in the judgement of uk military commanders in iraq and i would never seek to constrain their ability to make decisions
1430946 britain would release around 60 militia prisoners and stop patrolling inside the city in return the mehdi army agreed not to attack the british as they withdrew to the airport
1430947 lives were saved but basra was effectively abandoned now questions are being asked about just how far this deal tied british commanders hands during this years battle for basra
1430948 no secret deal or accommodation with the militias kept us out of the city
1430949 the only limit placed on the profile of our support was mr malikis rightful concern that the iraqi security forces be seen by the people of basrah to be those enforcing the rule of law in the city
1430950 had no bearing on the decision to go to the city
1430951 exactly under what circumstances the negotiations took place and whether or not they tied the hands of the british army
1430952 what would be unacceptable is if our troops were under effective political orders not to take risks because potential loss of life would be politically unacceptable
1430953 when the iraqi army needed help our forces should have been free to give that help as required

1430961 had both a haunting legacy and a very positive legacy
1430962 it was a time of a lot of anger and disillusionment on a lot of levels the idealism that many brought into 1968 and this great disappointment with what happens
1430963 that was sort of evident in the unhappiness of many of the radicals but their anger and their radicalism and their violence also alienated many other people who maybe before hadnt paid much attention to them and now were only paying negative attention to them
1430964 there certainly was a sense that the old guard the old powers that be should just have that power because theyre old and powerful
1430965 they were serious about the pig in some ways even if they were being funny
1430966 t he whole mess there and the violence that went on just encouraged people that the process was flawed and the need to really open it up
1430967 i think that there was a sense that the superdelegates if they had gone for hillary clinton over barack obama when the popular vote even though it was close was leaning the other way would have really led to a sense of alienation
1430968 i think theres more sensitivity now on the part of the superdelegates if so many people are behind him we cant just sort of willy nilly ignore that
1430969 the election today is fascinating because of the connection to all the candidates to that period of time
1430970 even if obama was young then his candidacy is certainly a product of the changes that came out of that period

1430974 it is similar to what other banks have been doing recently where they have been having rights issues
1430975 but the 3bn is taxpayers money that is money that is very much at risk
1430976 was being forced to hand over yet more money in order to keep this bank afloat
1430977 alistair darling assured parliament that taxpayer loans to northern rock would be fully secured on mortgage assets this is clearly not true
1430978 it doesnt have shareholders now that its owned by the government so its got to come to us so what weve said is that we will put in up to 3bn
1430979 weve got to get state aid approval for that so we cant give a precise figure but up to 3bn may be necessary
1430980 repaying the government loan is proceeding well ahead of target
1430981 this is the result of the success we are having with our redemption plan
1430982 things could be a lot worse 7 000 people could be out of work
1430983 research shows that most parents of overweight or obese children think their child is a healthy weight
1430984 this important move is not about pointing the finger it is about equipping parents with the information they need to help their children live healthier lives
1430985 im not sure all parents will understand what the measurements mean and what action they should take we are very good at pinpointing problems but not so good at deciding what needs to be done the government and trusts must make it clear what parents should do and who to turn to for advice

1430991 i did this before about eight years ago its certainly the most unusual wedding ive ever done
1430992 its been challenging certainly theres plenty of reference material in terms of what that world is like and what it means to look and feel and i think weve spent a long time over four years now trying to make sure the game is true to that series and provides an experience that fits what
1430993 for us creatively its a nice break from the elder scrolls weve been doing that series even before i joined bethesda in 1999 we were working on morrowind back then we get a good change of pace with this post apocalyptic world with a different system and vibe so hopefully our fresh insight will help in benefiting the game too

1430997 i love it here and i want to be part of the team so im happy to have signed my new contract
1430998 ive said from day one that i love the club and i want to do more for the club ive been together with these players for a couple of years now and the spirit is very good

1431000 scoring at wembley in the fa cup semi final and then the final meant a lot to me were in the history books now because this is the first time were going to be competing in europe
1431001 everybody wants to play in europe and being in the uefa cup gives us a greater opportunity to attract great players to the club
1431002 every footballer should be positive and believe they should do more we finished eighth last season and we want to improve on that again
1431003 personally i want to do more than i did last season in terms of goals and my all round football to work on my weaknesses and give 100 per cent to the club

1431009 the increased production in 2009 is a further example of sherwoods relentless pursuit of value for its shareholders
1431010 more production sooner should mean more value for our shareholders
1431011 further the previously announced 50 increase in mineral resources at the high grade minto mine is a very positive development the significantly increased mineral resource suggests potential for a longer mine life and or further increases in production beyond the rescheduled production announced today however the first time disclosure of substantial mineral resources at lower cut off grades which still results in mineral resource grades well above any operating copper mine in western canada provides a glimpse of what could be a materially larger opportunity at the minto mine and is something that warrants continued investigation
1431012 the financial analysis for the minto project demonstrates a robust project in all scenarios
1431013 using the current forward curve for copper and flat precious metal prices the minto mine generates an exceptionally positive cash flow there are opportunities to further increase project npv through the conversion of the mineral resources discovered and delineated in 2007 and 2008 to reserves the process for which is underway
1431014 given that the available mineral resource estimate has increased by 50 since the resource estimate used in the pfs and that a 25 000m drill program is underway to upgrade the confidence in and expand these resources a new pre feasibility study is warranted to evaluate the economic potential of these new resources once the 2008 drill program is completed
1431015 there is excellent potential for both an increased mine life and further increases in production given the tremendous exploration success at the high grade minto copper gold mine
1431016 while the overall grades in the resource estimates above are lower than currently being mined at the minto mine they average approximately twice that of currently operating copper mines in british columbia
1431017 these resources would require additional work to demonstrate positive economics nevertheless they do suggest an interesting opportunity for a considerably larger scale operation than would be contemplated at the higher cut off grades currently being used further these resource estimates encompass only a modest portion of what may be a much larger mineralized system further drilling is required to evaluate the potential continuity of the large untested areas between the currently defined mineral resources

1431033 losing a student is the worst thing that could happen to a school community and everyone is stunned
1431034 any support myself or the school can offer is available to the family and the many young people who will be so devastated
1431035 although it was an honor to be selected as a team member with such an elite group of companies petrosun has chosen to go down a separate path in order to expedite the potential of algae being processed into a commercial jet fuel
1431036 the darpa program has been stalled due to a protest that was filed on may 29th by a firm that was excluded from the darpa decision our withdrawal was prompted by the uncertainty of the award process combined with an opportunity to initiate a project with a renewable fuel refiner and a commercial jet fuel end user petrosuns corporate position acknowledges a true sense of urgency to prove that algae to biofuels can become an immediate part of the solution for our nations energy independence

1431041 the quino checkerspot butterfly is being squeezed out of the real estate market
1431042 it could turn an endangered plant or animal into an invasive one wreaking havoc on the new ecosystems native plants animals and insects
1431043 keeping the distance between the old and new habitats short is also key she camille parmesan a global change biologist said since many invasive species problems can be tied to continent to continent hops by plants and animals scientists should limit their targets to within 100 to 500 miles of a species original home
1431044 like many southern california natives the quino checkerspot butterfly is being squeezed out of the real estate market
1431045 i would talk to people about it at conservation meetings 10 years ago and it was totally completelydismissed
1431046 five years ago people were mumbling about it two years ago papers started coming out
1431047 i think its important for people to talk about assisted migration this is an issue that is not going to sit around and wait very long for us to figure it all out
1431048 when you start doing that work you realize that climate change is having a huge impact on where species live
1431049 a lot of biologists still think its into the future they dont realize weve already got enormous numbers of observed changes
1431050 when i first heard it come up it was discussed almost with revulsion that we would really tamper so heavily with ecosystems
1431051 its a very difficult pill to swallow to think we would be involved with that level of intensive management its a major paradigm shift
1431052 people are thinking of it as a realistic option that has to be considered recognizing again that its a last resort
1431053 i think it is something that probably in very limited circumstances we should be considering
1431054 it might be the only way for corals or some other species
1431055 for a lot of species we just dont know enough and we wouldnt consider them good candidates really its a tradeoff between how much you know about the species you want to move and how degraded the area is where you want to move them
1431056 its not aggressive and it doesnt defend nectar sources it eats a very common plant and never does much harm to plant populations and when you put it somewhere it tends to stay there
1431057 even the best disperser is not able to go 300 miles past large urban areas
1431058 the midwest is a real barrier for a lot of southern species that are trying to move north
1431059 my biggest fear is that people will misunderstand and think about this as a solution for climate change biodiversity problems but its not
1431060 it could never be a solution for a lot of species so greenhouse gas reduction should still be the no 1 priority
1431061 i think the big danger here is that we allow really reasonable farsighted thinking about assisted migration to be allowed as an excuse by decision makers to avoid mitigation measures
1431062 the trouble is that the climate hasnt stabilized at its new level yet
1431063 its a continually moving target until we get our atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases stabilized which were way far away from we dont know what the new climate is going to be
1431064 we often talk about 2050 or 2100 like well be done with climate change or have a new climate by then
1431065 but we dont know when climate change will be ending
1431066 if you are reduced to functional extinction to captive breeding program with no hope of returning a species to its original range migrating a species seems to be a better option than having it go extinct
1431067 we realized when it comes to plants if you have access to a private seed stock and someones property or horticultural nursery you can take those seeds and plant them on your property wherever you live

1431076 ronaldo is a fantastic player one of the best in the world
1431077 if he came it would be great of course but out of respect i cant say anything more about this matter
1431078 we know from al qaeda admissions and intelligence reports that terrorists are trying desperately to build dirty bombs or homemade nuclear weapons we also know that a nuclear reactor has been a desired al qaeda target unfortunately the nuclear regulatory commission and the nuclear industry continue to act as if these threats are somehow merely theoretical this complacency breeds neglect and neglect could breed disaster
1431079 we have made progress in securing nuclear plants and nuclear materials that can be used to make a dirty bomb but we need to do even more to reduce the risk of terrorist attacks that would exploit nuclear hazards
1431080 that is why congressman markey and i introduced the dirty bomb prevention act in 2002 why i have continued to press the nuclear regulatory commission to improve nuclear plant security and why i am proud to introduce this legislation today this bill will improve safety and security at both existing and proposed nuclear power plants and will improve tracking and security of radioactive material that could be used to make a dirty bomb
1431081 sempre qualquer debate que se promova no sentido de fazer um esclarecimento mais concreto para a sociedade v lido
1431082 a gente esperava que esse inverno fosse mais frio mas aqui em vit ria n o est aquele frio esperado como h dois anos como a gente trabalha com muitos produtos de inverno a gente v que n o est tendo tanta sa da como antes a demanda aqui em vit ria est devagar
1431083 por eu ser costureira o pessoal est me procurando muito para fazer blazer cal a comprida vestido de manga comprida
1431084 com essa mudan a de tempo ela passou a ter tosse coriza ai levei ela ao m dico que passou nebuliza o e xarope ela est melhor agora mas noite que esfria mais ela tem ataques de tosse e coriza
1431085 solar wind and all the other opportunities will be on the table for discussion
1431086 this plan sends a message that theres no urgency at all that lets just do whats required of us i dont think thats where we are today
1431087 eastman kodak is still in business today and its not selling film
1431088 i like to see the pud take a leadership role and be progressive
1431089 and the two big storms cost a lot of people a lot of gear
1431090 i think the verdict is still out at this point as to whether its going to be an effective tool for us to use
1431091 dungeness crab are subjected to that just like anything else
1431092 i became interested in the stiffness and all these crazy angles their dead bodies had
1431093 it takes approximately 20 mugs of maggots to yield just one drop of purified seraticin at present
1431094 i call on sen obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work
1431095 come off their vacation and address this energy crisis for america and dont leave until you do republican and democrat joining together and a very vital part of that is nuclear power
1431096 its fantastic to be called back into the test side
1431097 it is something obviously i had a goal for i aimed for and i worked hard towards it in the latter part of the winter i knew what i needed to work on and i went for it it is nice to be called back to this arena again
1431098 this summer has been very good for me in all forms of cricket
1431099 it has all been pretty prolific compared to the rest of my years the biggest change for me this season is i have been in fearless mode i have just been going out to play in the way i want to play and ive not thought too much about the game i know people say think about what you are doing but i havent done too much thinking to be honest i have just played the ball and if its there to hit hit it if its not dont
1431100 the challenge for me is to continue it with an england shirt on
1431101 the thing that all good test players do is take what they do for their counties and replicate it on the international stage that is what i am going to do if i get a chance to play test cricket again for england i am going to go out and do what i do for essex nothing different its the same ball game just different players
1431102 i dont have many regrets about sri lanka to be fair because it happened all so quickly
1431103 i didnt actually go out and change the way i played but the sri lankans were too good for me it just didnt go the way i imagined it to go and that was because of good pieces of bowling sometimes and other times my own error but it is important to move on quickly if you hang on to it too long you find yourself in a hole and dig yourself deeper and deeper you just have to assess what you need to do pick out the little points and go and do them dont look back just move forward
1431104 we know the series is over but we still have pride to play for and if i play it will give me the chance to put something on the board and go into the winter with something positive under my belt
1431105 hes the new captain and hes already rubbed off on me
1431106 you learn off guys like that and i have been lucky to have had very positive people around me mr gooch has been with me for a very long time and i have been around in this england changing room with the likes of kp next to me hes a good mate of mine and we talk a lot
1431107 i am going to go out and play for kev
1431108 he has a tough job on his hands because we all know the england captaincy is not an easy job i want to do well for kev and do well for england so that is all i am thinking about the vibe in the dressing room is very positive and very honest kev has been around a lot of good captains to learn off them we know he is a positive bloke and that he likes to play his cricket positively so thats a nice thing to be part of
1431109 when you go through lows you come out a different person
1431110 you become a more positive person i wouldnt say careless person but a more fearless person because youve been there
1431111 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1431112 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1431113 on november 6 2007 pickens reportedly offered a million dollars to anyone able to dispute any claims made by the swift vets and pows for truth svpt a group he had supported during the 2004 presidential election
1431114 cannot prove anything in the swift boat ads to be untrue
1431115 i am prepared to prove the lie and marshal all the evidence the question is whether you are prepared to fulfill your obligation
1431116 in reviewing your material none of the information you provide speaks specifically to the issues contained in the ads
1431117 and as a result does not qualify for the 1 million
1431118 that would give communal elements to carry out their plans
1431119 when the babri masjid was being demolished the then prime minister narasimha rao did not authorize the use of force on the violent mobs which proves that both parties are arrayed against muslims
1431120 the prime minister dr manmohan singh has convened an all parties meeting tomorrow and concerns are being voiced that the meet will hand over land to the shrine board thus making another bid to hurt the sentiments of muslims
1431121 in view of this apprehension the hurriyat g calls for a complete peaceful strike in the valley to convey to india that this decision will not be acceptable under any circumstances
1431122 the serious aspect of the situation is that the administration and the police are acting as mute spectators
1431123 the present situation in jammu makes it amply clear that the two nation concept of quaid e azam muhammad ali jinnah is a living reality can cannot be negated under any circumstances
1431124 the sixty years history of india bears witness that its rulers never gave minorities their rights and if the minorities raised their voice for their due they were silenced by the use of force

1431155 the residents of eight cities and towns in the county count on us to make a wide range of information available 7x24 and we needed an affordable storage system that could grow with us while providing the highest levels of availability performance and energy efficiency the clariion cx4 storage system brought together all of the features we were looking for into a single system that will support our vmware environment serving more than 24 departments and agencies using a range of applications
1431156 setting the new clariion cx4 system up and managing it was simple and we immediately saw the faster performance which is especially critical for online human services and public safety applications in addition were protecting the taxpayers investment because our clariion cx4 can be easily upgraded to support future technologies that will enable our it organization to continue to offer leading information services to the citizens of our communities
1431157 with this new clariion emc is continuing to press hard to address some of the most crucial cost and management challenges faced by storage and it managers to achieve that the clariion cx4 has technical advances on so many fronts simultaneously that its hard to find much that is missing the clariion cx4s new design and built in features including flash drives are delivered in a highly modular system that can be customized for midrange users precise needs as an incumbent market leader emc faces a bar that continually gets set higher yet the clariion cx4 seems to have cleared the latest height overall this is an extremely well thought out package from emc
1431158 emc is continuing to use its significant resources and talent to incorporate the innovative features that our customers require into a single scalable and easy to use midrange platform we are again pioneering the use of flash drives this time in midrange storage and have designed these systems to take full advantage of server virtualization technology the clariion cx4 series is unmatched in the industry when it comes to scalability features energy efficiency and ease of use with this next generation of systems weve extended our technology leadership and have widened the competitive gap even further

1431160 la manovra del governo berlusconi tesa a sostenere leconomia del paese e ad aiutare gli strati sociali pi deboli
1431161 depressiva e piena di elementi in grado di accentuare le disuguaglianze e le ingiustizie
1431162 lauspicio che finalmente la questione della stabilizzazione dei lavoratori con contratto a tempo determinato ritorni nellalveo delle relazioni industriali e sindacali e non sia pi oggetto di interventi legislativi affrettati e soprattutto mal consigliati
1431163 con la nostra iniziativa prosegue aldo di biagio le parti sociali recuperano la centralit del loro ruolo abbiamo infatti impegnato il governo ad introdurre nella disposizione transitoria una opportuna modifica che riporta alla possibilit per le aziende interessate dal provvedimento e le organizzazioni sindacali di sottoscrivere degli accordi migliorativi e pi vantaggiosi sia per i lavoratori che per le stesse imprese una soluzione logica alla quale peraltro recentemente approdata anche poste italiane il cui amministratore delegato l11 luglio scorso ha sottoscritto con le organizzazioni sindacali un protocollo di intesa per la stabilizzazione di circa 14mila precari precedentemente assunti con contratto a tempo determinato
1431164 in questo modo aggiunge il parlamentare si circoscrive la portata di una misura che ha suscitato gravi dubbi di costituzionalit in quanto tratta casi simili la violazione da parte di un datore di lavoro della normativa sui contratti a termine in maniera difforme semplicemente in base alla data di presentazione del ricorso o alla velocit con la quale il giudice competente ha definito la causa
1431165 impegnano inoltre il governo per quanto concerne la stampa italiana allestero nel procedere alla semplificazione e riordino nel settore delleditoria
1431166 ad integrare la composizione della commissione di cui allarticolo 26 comma 3 della legge 5 agosto 1981 n
1431167 la camera si legge nellodg aveva modificato il testo proponendo che lassegno sociale venisse corrisposto agli aventi diritto a condizione che avessero soggiornato legalmente e lavorato legalmente con un reddito almeno pari allimporto dellassegno sociale in via continuativa per almeno dieci anni nel territorio nazionale successivamente il senato ha soppresso le parole e lavorato legalmente con un reddito almeno pari allimporto dellassegno sociale risultano confermate le restrizioni relative alla residenza continuativa di dieci anni senza riferimento alcuno alla residenza storica cio a periodi di residenza in qualsiasi periodo anteriore alla data di presentazione della domanda di assegno sociale le restrizioni rischiano di precludere ai cittadini italiani emigrati ove rientrassero nel territorio italiano a causa delle situazioni di indigenza presenti in molti paesi di emigrazione la possibilit di accedere allassegno sociale

1431180 chemical contamination at e waste recycling and disposal sites in ghana
1431181 many of the chemicals released are highly toxic some may affect childrens developing reproductive systems while other can affect brain development and the nervous system
1431182 unless companies eliminate all hazardous chemicals from their electronic products and take responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products this poisonous dumping will continue
1431183 electronics companies must not allow their products to end up poisoning the poor around the world

1431190 endometriosis occurs when cells of the inner lining of the womb are found growing outside of the uterus
1431191 we found the telomere a region at the end of all chromosomes that prevents the chromosome destroying itself during cell division is abnormally long in women with endometriosis
1431192 our research shows however that cells in the lining of the womb are unique in that they can express this enzyme in the early stages of the menstrual cycle when cell division is important but not during the latter stages when implantation of the fertilised embryo becomes a priority
1431193 women who have endometriosis express this enzyme in both the early and late stages of the menstrual cycle which means that the cells will continue to divide and lose their focus in supporting the establishment of a pregnancy as a result the lining of the womb may be more hostile to an early pregnancy and the cells that are shed at this late stage in the menstrual cycle may be more aggressive and more able to survive and implant outside the uterus causing pain in the pelvic or abdomen area
1431194 this study demonstrates how remedial instruction can use the plasticity of the human brain to gain an educational improvement
1431195 focused instruction can help underperforming brain areas to increase their proficiency
1431196 any kind of education is a matter of training the brain when poor readers are learning to read a particular brain area is not performing as well as it might and remedial instruction helps to shape that area up
1431197 this finding shows that poor readers can be helped to develop buff brains a similar approach should apply to other skills
1431198 we are at the beginning of a new era of neuro education
1431199 the duraheart gives us a new third generation option for patients with advanced heart failure who need help to allow them to survive until they can receive a heart transplant
1431200 this trial will test the durahearts potential to overcome some of the issues that have been seen with other devices including hemolysis caused by shear stress on red blood cells and clotting risk caused by blood that does not circulate rapidly enough from all areas of the chamber
1431201 it also remains to be seen if this device offers superior durability which might make it useful as a destination therapy that could remove the need for a heart transplant
1431202 and the dealership is supposed to keep it behind the counter and only give it out to people who fit the demographic and if there are customers who dont fit the demographic of the dark custom looking for something similar they are to be steered away form the dark custom stuff
1431203 if a nation is forced into starvation by imposing a blockade it is an act of war
1431204 economic blockade constitutes an instrument of economic warfare as per international law vandals have vested into themselves all forms of consensus and authority and imposed an economic blockade the viciousness and brutality of the economic blockade is aimed at subjugating the kashmiri nation
1431205 economic pressure is being exerted in order to gain supremacy in the conflict it is time that the people of kashmir understand the objectives of an economic blockade even the most fascist states have exempted medicines and essential items from an economic blockade the current economic blockade imposed on the kashmiris nourishes no such pretensions even baby milk powder or medicines are not being allowed the export of horticulture products like apples has been strategically stopped to demolish the horticulture industry by ensuring that the apples are stranded into a rot
1431206 beneath the fa ade of hooligans forcing an economic blockade emerges the stark reality of the state administration actively conniving to enforce an economic blockade hooligans cannot impose an economic blockade the silence and inaction by the indian state is an indicator of their culpability in facilitating the economic blockade
1431207 no kashmiri hurriyat leader has been able to step into jammu in the presence of the shiv sena nor would they be allowed to do so in future
1431208 syed ali shah geelani muhammad yaseen malik maulana abbas ansari shabir ahmad shah and other hurriyat leaders too should forget jammu because henceforth their entry into the city will not only be difficult but also impossible
1431209 jammu muslims are with us and a contact programme with them is on

1431213 ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy
1431214 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
1431215 is israels lifeblood no one understands this better than israels enemies that is precisely why they still engage in a systematic campaign to erase the historical link of the jews to this great city for if israel were severed from jerusalem the jewish state would lose its sense of legitimacy and its will to fight only then could israel be destroyed
1431216 what befalls jerusalem threatens the security of the united states and its allies worldwide thats because jerusalem and israel are ground zero in the global battle between tyranny and democracy radicalism and moderation terrorism and freedom

1431263 da una parte per queste olimpiadi c stata unapertura un po costretta anche per lopinione pubblica internazionale per questo non vuol dire che ci sar un cambiamento vero e proprio dopo le olimpiadi afferma a news italia press michele soranzo che cura il portale vivishangai bisogna vedere cosa succeder adesso per esempio tanti siti che erano stati bloccati come quello di amnesty international bbc cinese wikipedia sono stati riaperti ma dubito che verranno mantenuti aperti anche dopo le olimpiadi

1431284 to imagine this from a russian perspective you would now have a georgia inside nato
1431285 and georgia borders unto chechnya and it is very hard to think of a more sensitive issue for russians than chechnya and now you would have nato membership right on its doorstep in the north caucasus
1431286 so this is caught up with that it is also caught up now with president medvedevs desire to show a more strident russian foreign policy a more prestige seeking policy this would be a huge blow to his regime if nato could move this close into what are considered vital russian national interests
1431287 after the rose revolution four years ago georgia has truly been the country in the former soviet bloc after the baltic states in the early 1990s to thoroughly remake their country to reform and to install a democratic government that is a functioning independent state although there is of course a long way to go before georgia consolidates its democracy
1431288 it has made tremendous progress and has become a model and a symbol of what can actually be achieved in anti corruption and democracy building and russia doesnt like that but for the west of course if georgia fails if georgia is allowed to fall this means that any hopes that we may have of democracy building in this part of the world in this south eastern corner of europe is going to fail
1431289 its a corridor a very important corridor for oil from the caspian region going to the black sea and the mediterranean through turkey
1431290 so its now an area that has become economically important as well
1431291 across the region from ukraine over the caucasus to central asia there is no country in which the united states has invested so much of its prestige as in georgia which means that if suddenly georgia is allowed to fail and if the united states does not stand up for georgia and georgias integrity and security every government from kiev to tashkent will draw the conclusion that the united states is not a serious partner and in that sense for a very long time it will undermine u s interests in the whole of eurasia

1431299 if the 20 to 40 percent of the time sales people do cold prospecting because they dont trust marketings leads could be devoted to actually selling we think it could release 1 trillion in revenue
1431300 send an e mail inviting the lead to a webinar send them a t shirt whatever
1431301 sales will be a lot less resistant to what marketings doing and marketing can get a more equal place at the table
1431302 why yes i want to have a sales conversation with you
1431303 personally i hate them voice bots unless theyre providing a value added service if its a simple replacement for hitting 1 2 3 on my keypad then dont bother
1431304 if theyre context sensitive with relatively natural language support like tellme or goog411 thats fine
1431305 for most consumers when they have a problem feeling validated is as important as getting a resolution
1431306 if a consumer feels wronged in some way theyre in contact as much to vent their frustration and hear an im sorry as they are to get the problem solved bots are not very good at this especially since the consumer knows its not a person and it doesnt get their frustration
1431307 our benchmark shows that call volumes continue to climb at an alarming rate and companies have to invest in technology to deflect a percentage of these calls while consistency is certainly a benefit the roi return on investment of call deflection receives the bulk of attention

1431310 this is an example of zealous marketing replacing common sense
1431311 i can envision legal action being a logical response to false light defamation and misappropriation of image in addition to privacy law suits i can assure you that a jury of offended citizens will seek to award extreme relief to an injured private citizen
1431312 the legislatures are behind the curve in providing remedies that would amount to a commercial prohibition against these abuses
1431313 in most jurisdictions damage awards are quite modest today proof of actual damages opposed to damages to feelings noneconomic losses can be very difficult
1431314 first it depends on what data were talking about second it depends on what country you are talking about for example the eu has much stronger laws on privacy then does the u s
1431315 laws in the eu canada and other privacy sensitive countries forbid the transfer of personally identifiable information outside of the country this includes both customer and employee information
1431316 information that is even viewed on a screen in a different country is considered to have been transferred even if the database isnt stored in that country
1431317 a practical implication of the patriot act may be that individuals will choose to deal with businesses that do not share their information with u s linked affiliates or service providers
1431318 with heightened media attention given to the reach of the patriot act and therefore increasing awareness of the act as well as its inherently political nature clients may be scared off by the hype even if in practice the result is not that different than before the patriot act
1431319 everything you watch at the movies and most of tv is totally and absolutely scripted and it is far from awful well some of it is but thats content and a different subject
1431320 the biggest error in scripts is actually first the writing and second the formatting
1431321 skip any tendency to make a speech in the script
1431322 scripts are helpful in the initial phases when a person joins the company but in the long run the employee should use his her experience presence of mind and business knowledge to handle the issue

1431324 the primary decision is what crm package drives the best business value
1431325 operational crms are often integrated with the companys public web site wherever it may be but are usually hosted
1431326 analytical crms are often integrated with business intelligence engines and are very often in house along with the
1431327 the collaborative crm will sometimes include channel management but most often is hosted in house
1431328 corporate paranoia is a big factor in deciding where analytical and collaborative crms are hosted even if physical security of the servers at most hosting companies is far greater than that of most businesses in house servers
1431329 on demand crm allows companies to get up and running quickly by accessing software via a web browser
1431330 because on demand crm software is offered under a subscription customers do not take on as much financial risk as when paying the traditional upfront license maintenance fee of client server software the subscription model combined with upgrades and support services make on demand crm software an attractive option for a lot of companies
1431331 in comparing on premise to saas be aware that saas solutions offer faster time to value frequent automatic updates independence from it and good usability
1431332 putting the differences of hosted crm packages aside some of the pros of a basic hosted solution include specialized operational management capability inherent disaster recovery ease of implementation fully managed upgrades and environment changes specialized security management and lower operating cost
1431333 hosted applications had a rapid rise and fall in the past decade
1431334 their essential flaw was that they still had all the flaws of traditional client server apps they were expensive and time consuming to implement costly and difficult to maintain and impossible to upgrade without breaking valuable customizations this all has changed with software as a service
1431335 all you need is an internet connection and a web browser which translates to tremendous cost savings on both hardware and it personnel to maintain the systems
1431336 additionally on demand solutions offer a level of uptime security and scalability that midmarket companies would otherwise not have the resources to deploy themselves
1431337 additional risks for saas solutions include loss of control weaker integration limited virtualization and more restricted customization capabilities compared to on premise solutions
1431338 its not easy to get off if you wanted too
1431339 look at your contract before you leap some contracts make it hard to leave or even to turn them off
1431340 vendors make it sound easy but its really tough to do
1431341 you need to figure out beforehand how to its a real technical challenge since its usually stored in a vendor environment
1431342 for companies who have deep customization and integration requirements on demand crm may not always be the best approach we have seen larger companies choose sugar on site instead of sugar ondemand because they have more control over application customization performance and data security
1431343 on premise solutions offer stronger integration benefits than saas resulting in enhanced integration with other it and operational systems especially when real time integration is important
1431344 on premise or on site crm can deliver more control around customization and integration than on demand crm if a company wants to make substantial changes to the data model of the application they will want to go on site most likely because the application is open and modifiable
1431345 for those it shops that havent reached a level of maturity around service delivery management on premise crm offers the security of knowing that the infrastructure is under direct company control and changes and risk management can be handled locally
1431346 on premise deployments typically require greater up front costs especially when comparing license fees with subscription fees on premise deployments typically also require hardware maintenance upgrades and support costs on top of license fees while most saas deployments bundle these into the subscription fees
1431347 an outright purchase may result in significant savings over a 3 to 5 year term however if you are just looking for an interim solution a hosted model is probably the right choice
1431348 on premise solutions have risks primarily implementation risks due to deployment complexities training needs and support issues
1431349 complexity around customization and integration complicated upgrades difficult user interfaces for end users and slow time to value all resulting in a high risk investment are major drawbacks
1431350 i would very strongly recommend that you run a pilot program to test how things work before committing
1431351 it is crucial that you document thoroughly the user process for handling the systems and compare how that process is executed on the various programs you decide to consider have the vendor do a demo using your task action script for the users handling of the product so that you can see exactly what is necessary for each task and the complexity of execution
1431352 as crm saas solutions have gained more acceptance and usage buyers are starting to consider using saas in more creative ways rather than thinking about saas vs on premise crm solutions as mutually exclusive crm professionals are starting to implement hybrid deployments
1431353 for example implementing an on premise solution for large user populations with complex business processes and supplementing with an saas solution to fill the needs of remote or specialized business units since many crm solutions are now being offered as both on premise and saas versions hybrid approaches are becoming more feasible
1431354 in order to reflect the communitys disgust of your activities
1431355 for marketing blogs work great to build brand equity and familiarity
1431356 wikis can be a cheap way to maintain a product web site for both marketing and for service
1431357 are good for building customer communities around products and brands
1431358 you do need to have strong moderation when you offer user support forums to make sure bad discussion threads are removed immediately
1431359 you would never want to learn that a 1 million a year customer is venting its service frustrations through your user forum thats something the account manager needs to be on top of
1431360 it costs 10 000 to 15 000 in hard expenses to replace a single call center worker
1431361 we push for more contact with supervisors that are not punitive
1431362 some of the most successful retention programs offer advanced training and certification programs and in the case of multinationals an opportunity to travel to the u s and other countries as part of training and team building
1431363 i have seen call centers give away motorcycles large cash bonuses and other types of big incentives
1431364 think outside the box and look for something that really appeals to your staff
1431365 i strongly disagree with using identifiers of that nature in fact use of the equivalent of the u s social security number in canada by anyone other than the government for any purpose carries a fine of 500 per number per use statutory penalty
1431366 i would add to data collected on customers their favorite wine chocolate and flower you may want to celebrate a milestone or make an apology
1431367 a customers wish list including items or services you do not provide

1431372 theres really only one way for them to be convinced of the value of sfa if they make more money using it than not using it
1431373 your personal ownership and control of customers and contacts will be the same or better customers will be marked as yours others wont be allowed to mess with them management wont randomly reassign them to others the rules management use for reassigning customers to balance workload and or to maximize collective revenue will be fair and stable
1431374 the software has been chosen for its intuitiveness you wont have to take out time from selling to learn how to use it
1431375 executive dashboards let management monitor rather than you having to report and that saves you time and hassle and who knows they may actually be able to help you
1431376 everything will be tightly security protected and backed up no one will be able to steal your data
1431377 if anyone has contact with your customers for example when youre out of the office you will get to find out about it more quickly and reliably likewise if a compelling event occurs such as an up sell opportunity a complaint a supplier quality problem or a delivery logistics issue you will be notified almost immediately
1431378 it takes two seconds to know the entire history of any given client which makes you look really on the ball to the customer
1431379 process produces results repeatable processes improve business and improving business equals job growth opportunities and wealth
1431380 you will be provided with a more convenient more portable device such as a pda a tablet or a smartphone something you can write on or speak into rather than rushing back to the office to fill out forms you will be able to tailor the way you use it and customize the screen layout the way you want to
1431381 knowing where your wins come from can lead to focused marketing improved sales and more money in your pocket
1431382 sales management wont hover over you all the time micromanaging your priorities and how youre handling your accounts
1431383 by using the sfa tool you are proving youre a professional and management is more likely to trust your forecasts and let you manage your priorities
1431384 they will of course inquire about variances perhaps using an online form that you can answer when you have time they wont however hit you with random requests for status updates
1431385 bear in mind theres an operator in the centre of the ride who watches it going around theres an attendant on the side of the ride who is able to jump on as its moving without any problem
1431386 youve also got the parents to hold their two or three year olds on a horse riding for nothing just for safety precautions
1431387 nothing has ever happened in the 100 years the rides been operating but because this particular inspector had a bright idea that it could happen and made an issue of it the ride wont work in queensland again
1431388 he wanted me to redesign the whole thing and im not willing to do that to a 120 year old machine
1431389 mental illness is responsible for 13 3 per cent of the total burden of disease in australia and so is clearly one of the most significant conditions for the nation
1431390 people have customer records in multiple systems and when theyre inconsistent strange things start to happen
1431391 what youll find is that most companies have never actually written all this information down the way they deal with customers has evolved over time and a lot of it is based on tribal knowledge
1431392 unfortunately some enterprises are not addressing this issue at all because they are not aware of the danger
1431393 using an outsourcer or hosted crm makes it very easy to accidentally or blindly transfer data outside of the country without the necessary legal protections
1431394 information that is even viewed on a screen in a different country is considered to have been transferred even if the database isnt stored in that country
1431395 there is a very wide range of local legislation in place and emerging in the various states
1431396 there is little doubt that these restrictions will become more prevalent as irresponsible dissemination of personal data results in or becomes an attributed source of identity theft
1431397 i worked at a large health care company and implemented a national crm application based on a hosted crm system although they were ok with contact information they would not approve any health protected information hpi from being stored on outside servers
1431398 regardless that the information was encrypted stored apart from other companies data could not be seen by the vendor and had strong passwords for users they were not about to let any hpi data outside their own firewalls
1431399 the best practices are to thoroughly investigate what your outsourcers and hosted companies are doing with your information their promises of compliance to laws should be included in your contracts and penalties should be listed for noncompliance
1431400 these new fees would not be based on cost recovery
1431401 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1431402 it could be half a per cent cut by christmas
1431403 i ate a lean cuisine meal and then i craved seventeen pounds of chocolate to suppress my post lean cuisine hunger
1431404 now saying this meal is 6 ounces isnt going to get this meal flying off the shelves but what if we said it was 6 and
1431405 so i will give this 3 stars docking one star for being a fairly boring albeit satisfying meal and then docking another star for being a condescending bitch
1431406 while others have linked agent orange to cancers such as soft tissue sarcomas hodgkins disease and lymphoma there is limited evidence so far associating it with prostate cancer
1431407 here we report on the largest study to date of vietnam war veterans exposed to agent orange and the incidence of prostate cancer
1431408 our countrys veterans deserve the best possible health care and this study clearly confirms that agent orange exposure during service in vietnam is associated with a higher risk of prostate cancer later in life
1431409 just as those with a family history of prostate cancer or who are of african american heritage are screened more frequently so too should men with agent orange exposure be given priority consideration for all the screening and diagnostic tools we have at our disposal in the hopes of early detection and treatment of this disease
1431410 it is not about choosing between health systems strengthening on the one hand and disease specific programmes on the other
1431411 it is about working together to generate added value the time has come to move from observing the intentional and unintentional impacts of health investments to actively managing better outcomes that can be sustained
1431412 this collaboration will be useful at the country and global levels we will generate new knowledge work with countries to improve their approaches and share lessons at the regional and global levels
1431413 the ability to effectively communicate during crisis situations is critical especially given todays legacy patchwork of first responder communications systems
1431414 verizon communications interoperability solution is a powerful tool that underscores how verizon business continues to bring innovation through ip

1431437 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
1431438 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
1431439 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
1431440 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1431441 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1431442 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
1431443 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1431444 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1431445 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1431446 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1431447 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
1431448 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1431449 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery

1431456 the at amp t global network combined with our powerful computing platform is driving the convergence of networking and hosting services in ways that are allowing companies to deliver end user applications whenever and wherever they are needed while paying only for the capacity actually used

1431458 fans of the 2008 olympic games expect to go online searching for a variety of content about the olympic games and athletes
1431459 we anticipate rapidly increasing traffic up to and during the beijing olympic games tapering off in the months following the events at amp t synaptic hosting is ideal for handling the fluctuating online demand associated with the olympic games

1431461 given the increasingly dynamic nature of end user requirements businesses need flexible delivery platforms for their applications
1431462 this trend is driving the need for network cloud based on demand capabilities such as utility computing the challenge for service providers is to productize these capabilities in a way that enable businesses to easily tailor the solutions to serve their specific needs synaptic hosting is one example of how managed services can be offered in a modular fashion enabling efficient scalability and on demand delivery

1431472 i have used a lot of crms such as salesforce but i am actually using a microsoft plug in now called business contact manager its just a bigger contact manager in outlook
1431473 i would add company name history so you can pull up any previous company employment and decision person which clarifies if this person is one of the key people making purchase decisions or if someone else in the organization is
1431474 other organizations and associations they belong to can be very helpful
1431475 i will just add as the no 1 item the customers consent to use their personal data for sales service and marketing purposes including contacting them and their preferred contact method channel and time
1431476 perhaps your respondents assumed privacy and choice information was included already i believe it is too important to be implicitly assumed in fact in canada it is not legal to do so opt in is required to be explicit
1431477 surveys show customers prefer using automated voice systems to waiting for an agent yet satisfaction with many voice systems remains low
1431478 though support organizations are embracing next generation web self service most companies have yet to evolve their voice self service systems beyond basic interactive voice response menus
1431479 my research showed that companies are getting such a good payback from mediocre technology that they arent incented sic to invest in better technology to successfully handle a wider array of issues
1431480 i switched cell phone providers because they were routinely screwing up my bill and every time i wanted to get it resolved i had to spend at least 5 to 10 minutes troubleshooting my problem with a phone bot before i could ever get a live person on the phone
1431481 their savings in customer support call center costs cost them my business
1431482 just like web self service the work is not over when the project goes live
1431483 too many companies seem to launch an ivr or enhanced voice self service without how to train a call center agent
1431484 even the most hateful and revolting speech is protected speech

1431486 my brother hosam and i knew that obama will be a big hit even before he became a candidate we knew the guy would be a celebrity in gaza so we decided to invest the amount of 29 000 to buy obama t shirts from his website and sell them in gaza
1431487 i know on the back of this story obama rivals will present our business as a donation and they will try to use this story to let obama fall but im telling you we bought t shirts
1431488 we have nothing to do with the obama campaign we just like obama and believe he will be the best for the palestinians and for the world
1431489 some young men even bought the t shirts for 60 shekel 17 29 which is a lot to spend in gaza on a t shirt but that is how much gazans like obama
1431490 maybe we sold the shirts for a lot more i cant remember now
1431491 we dont want to cause any damage to obamas campaign
1431492 not just the people in gaza but people from all over the world are rooting for this great man
1431493 i am not familiar with the particulars of the case so i am commenting in general the fec will have to examine all the circumstances before determining any wrongdoing
1431494 hamas might win the battle but this behavior makes it so much harder to win international support to create an independent state this is the behavior of a brutal dictatorship not a political party working towards advancing the interests of its people
1431495 it is beyond doubt that there are now two separate palestinian territories so who does israel deal with mahmoud abbas does not speak for palestinians in gaza and hamas is not interested in any negotiations with israel at all this civil war makes a permanent solution impossible to negotiate
1431496 we have seen palestinians making war on other palestinians while the jewish state has come to the rescue of those who fear for their lives israel has never looked so good
1431497 instruct the prime minister to halt the carrying out of diplomatic contacts with the palestinian authority and with syria excepting vital and urgent matters until the formation of a new government just as was the practice for past governments
1431498 upon the announcement of pending resignation of the prime minister the government of israel became in practice if not also strictly according to law a transitional government
1431499 the supreme court set in a series of decisions that when a prime minister resigns from office the government and its ministers are to act with the reserve appropriate for the standing of a retiring government and to act only on pressing matters
1431500 the negotiations with the palestinian authority have been carried out for a long period by various israeli governments we are talking about processes whose outcomes may have a major influence on the future of the state for many years to come the continuation of these contacts during the short period remaining until the replacement of the current government varies from the area of reasonableness there is no critical public need for the carrying out of negotiations during the short period remaining for this government and it is prohibited that such important and critical negotiations be carried out when what is said may tie the hands of the next prime minister and government ministers the self control in the exercise of the authority of the regime require the prime minister not to tie the hands of the next government and not to hurriedly complete complicated processes that have been underway in one form or another for years
1431501 the rationality of continued western negotiations with iran depends on two assumptions that iran is far enough away from having deliverable nuclear weapons that we dont incur excessive risks by talking and that by talking we dont materially impede the option to use military force
1431502 every day that goes by allows iran to increase the threat it poses and the viability of the military option steadily declines over time
1431503 iran is pursuing two goals simultaneously both of which it is comfortably close to achieving the first to possess all the capabilities necessary for a deliverable nuclear weapon is now almost certainly impossible to stop diplomatically thus irans second objective becomes critical to make the risks of a military strike against its program too high and to make the likelihood of success in fracturing the program too low time favors iran in achieving these goals u s and european diplomats should consider this while waiting by the telephone for iran to call
1431504 hotels are struggling to control their costs while faced with the challenges of a soft economy and the decline in business and leisure travel
1431505 our goal is to allocate saved dollars back into their available daily rate adr or their net profit per room while helping them reduce their environmental demands
1431506 growing up in israel we were always conscious about energy and being responsible about water use when i moved to canada it struck me that all the hallways in public buildings were lit all the time whereas in israel you press a button for a few minutes of light to get you where you need to go
1431507 un black trendy french for noir has a good chance to become president of the united states a guy like us president of one of the worlds most powerful nations
1431508 irans written response to the six countries involved in the nuclear negotiations was handed to officials at the european union by irans ambassador to brussels

1431512 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george coming back tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationary and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals saying you may not like this but here is our next mission and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish ultimately people even talked about it after the fact it was a dark day for the cia it was the kind of thing where they said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forward a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1431513 if i am president i will immediately direct the full resources of the federal government and the full energy of the private sector working with state and local governments to achieve a single overarching goal in ten years we will eliminate the need for oil from the entire middle east and venezuela
1431514 like all compromises this one has its drawbacks it does include a limited amount of new offshore drilling and while i still dont believe thats a particularly meaningful short term or long term solution what ive said is im willing to consider it if its necessary to actually pass a comprehensive plan
1431515 i call on senator obama to call on congress to come back into town and come back to work come off their recess come off their vacation and address this energy challenge to america and dont leave until we do republican and democrat joining together and a very vital part of that is nuclear power and another vital part of that is offshore drilling we have to drill here and drill now
1431516 im not satisfied in part because i think they havent been as forthcoming not only with me but with the american people about the status of this investigation i also havent seen the evidence and i think that given their checkered past and the difficulty that they had in getting to this point the bungling of the hatfill part of the investigation leads me to be very skeptical
1431517 we oppose the visit by bush who sells us beef with its risk of mad cow disease that threatens the health and lives of the public

1431520 working with customers and business partners weve learned that many are eager to explore research and develop embedded and mobile rfid solutions that require small form factors and low power requirements
1431521 the development kits include everything they need to experiment with design and develop rfid applications that meet these needs
1431522 the rfid market is expanding rapidly and thingmagics embedded rfid reader modules are being used in a wide variety of industries and consumer and commercial applications
1431523 weve made it as easy as possible to purchase thingmagic products at our new online store which enables us to more efficiently serve the diverse market for embedded rfid applications
1431524 the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1431525 over time the substantial easing of monetary policy combined with ongoing measures to foster market liquidity should help to promote moderate economic growth
1431526 while we continue to expect paid claims to increase throughout 2008 the rate at which claims are being paid has begun to slow somewhat due to loss mitigation opportunities as well as from various state and lender foreclosure moratoriums and the overall volume of potential foreclosures in the marketplace
1431527 going forward we expect the slowdown in the pace at which we are paying claims to continue to have an impact on our delinquency inventory levels
1431528 time for new leadership to take the business to the next level
1431529 provided for fixed remuneration of 600 000 per annum with performance targets which could deliver an extra 300 000 per annum the executive also stood to receive 200 000 of shares that would vest over three years and were contingent upon the groups long term business plan

1431567 why are you blocking them coming back you should be protesting the war not the troops
1431568 what will things look like the day after the election
1431569 we think etfs are a very logical extension of our business we view the etf as an important delivery mechanism for our strategies
1431570 i dont solicit all this press coverage the press finds me i think that the press finds me because im colorful im not shy i have an opinion and i frankly really dont care if someone agrees or disagrees with it im willing to share
1431571 the controversy the invective that i get comes primarily from the games industry people always writing me emails and asking me what do you think about this
1431572 i publish my monthly console and handheld hardware numbers because the neogaf guys think its so fun
1431573 but no ones ever asked to see my annual forecast for all those things im spot on for my annual forecast id love to see those guys put out a contest for annual forecasts for the next five years and then well compare my numbers to theirs because ive been spot on for five or six years now
1431574 the average neogaf visitor isnt equipped to actually prepare those things
1431575 because it requires you to make an assumption about pricing and ive been great on that as well its hard to do
1431576 i love the innovation i love the opportunistic rapid market response i think this companys going to earn a lot more money than most people do
1431577 im just making an economic argument not so much a suggestion

1431579 i just meant that the public is willing to spend more for the content that they want
1431580 again adjusted for inflation the old psone game in 1995 that came out at 49 99 would be probably about 70 bucks right now just at 3 percent inflation compounded for the last 12 years youd be up over 70 on an apples to apples basis 60 is a bargain and the content of a ps3 game is a lot greater or an xbox 360 game than the content of the first generation psone games
1431581 continuing strength in international markets coupled with healthy demand in the u s helped drive higher worldwide sales of semiconductors in june
1431582 key demand drivers for semiconductors especially personal computers which account for 40 percent of semiconductor sales and mobile phones which drive about 20 percent of demand continued to show double digit unit growth
1431583 in 2008 developing countries with sales of over 153 million units will account for half of worldwide pc sales
1431584 i would say what ties it all together is the economy the economy of the game is very much controlled by the players all prices are decided on the market ccp doesnt set a price on it and then the game very much focuses on the fact that youre always at risk in terms of all the players attacking you or taking something away from you so that creates very interesting interactions between war and the economy
1431585 war and economy is something that has created a lot of events in human history that is essentially what we maybe have put in place to drive the storyline but then the players have used those systems to create something much more spectacular than we could ever have envisioned in the beginning so i would say the economy is the tool to create this
1431586 for soliciting community feedback we have used various methods throughout the four years and were trying to evolve those as our world has evolved you use different methods for a community of 50 000 players than you do for a community of 200 000 players especially when all those players live in the same world its different when you have sharded worlds down to smaller shards and you just have more shards and you have to tackle the community of each shard then you can use the same method but scale it up but when the community fundamentally grows as it has in our case then you have to adapt and evolve your method of soliciting community feedback and were now at this fanfest introducing a new idea which we call the council of stellar management which involves allowing the community to elect representatives for a council and well do this through voting so this council will then be a venue for exchange between the community and ccp so that it is a more meaningful discussion than us talking in a non structured way with 200 000 people which um achieves very little in its current form
1431587 e3 to me this year felt more like it was being done out of habit than anything else there werent any big surprises really just about every game that we saw we knew was coming had already seen at a game day event with rare exception we pretty much had already heard everything everyone had to say it just felt like we were all kind of there because we all get together for e3 every year
1431588 obviously there was no kentia hall so there goes a lot of the obscure the korean the sort of the variety of stuff that you would see over in kentia hall that was deliberate on the part of the esa in previous years they had allowed a range of smaller publishers to draft on their coattails as they saw it and this year they decided not to do that for me coming from newsweek i tend to have to cover some of the bigger games with a mix of smaller games and i am personally more interested in indie games than ive been in the past and again because i couldnt get over to barker hanger i couldnt see those
1431589 i go to a news conference for news and little news was being made you have all these companies these video game publishers that are based in the united states yet sony and their third parties just announced a whole slew of new games in japan immediately following e3 and its not even tokyo game show what does that say when those games could have been announced at e3
1431590 i know the japanese market needs a boost as far as the ps3 is concerned but what does that say about north americas position in the global game market when sony can just have its own event not even a full week after e3 and unveil a slate of new games from itself and third parties and it s not even tgs

1431594 this is another symptom of the decline of the way games are being built
1431595 you know what you know what im working on at works not for me anymore
1431596 okay this isnt the thing that i thought it was
1431597 alright so my kid wants gears of war and its m rated and it says blood and gore intense violence and strong language on the back alright i got a pretty broad idea of what that means but what specifically is it
1431598 okay this is what this game has in it if you allow this game into your house this is whats in it
1431599 how is my kid going to respond to this specific type of content
1431600 this is what a movie is about uh but its got this bit in it that if youve got little kids they might find its a bit scary
1431601 and i think just knowing that cos like my little one when the dvd was on hed know when the frank part in cars was coming
1431602 alright what i need to know is whats in it is there gonna be a part that spooks them
1431603 theres no drugs in this what the hell were they talking about
1431604 what was this though is it potions is that what theyre talking about is it the fact that youre taking these like
1431605 we have this game and i was fine with it because of these reasons
1431606 yeah i really liked burnout but the music was quite angry im not sure if i wanted all that angry punk and metal you know im not sure if i want my kids
1431607 oh the car crashes made my kid start slamming his car into the furniture
1431608 well i already decided thats good so you know you just validated my opinion of that
1431609 okay its m rated but i think its okay for a 14 year old say
1431610 yeah you know its okay its mostly blue and green blood so its fine
1431611 look its okay for us all to have our threshold somewhere different and this is where mine is and these people agree and these people dont
1431612 thank god you said that cos i do that too
1431613 hey you know i heard that you were doing this
1431614 oh my kid really wants to play videogames but i know nothing about it can you come and help me
1431615 yeah dont tell me what to think just help me think better
1431616 how long is too long my kid locks himself up in a room for hours and i wanna put a time limit on it but because i have no frame of reference for the experience i dont know where to put a cap on it my gut is i dunno an hour
1431617 i told my kid he can only play for an hour and then i call up and say you gotta turn it off now and hell say hes not played it yet how is that possible
1431618 well he could be spending an hour painting his car
1431619 hey lets sit down together and set up a team together
1431620 lets sit down in forza and build the car i had when i was 18
1431621 okay this is what the console is these are the costs these are the hidden costs that you might not know about here are the parental controls that it offers
1431622 well they want this new they really love cars they want this this mater game
1431623 well is it white is it black does it have a green ring on the front
1431624 this is fantastic this is fantastic but it choked here or it did this thing i didnt want it to do here
1431625 okay well i probably wouldve responded that way as well
1431626 alright starting from scratch thinking about a completely different kind of audience how do we want to talk to them
1431627 often discussions among game educators are reduced to the question of
1431628 the holiday season is upon us and with it comes the launch of not one but two new consoles and a veritable tsunami of games some great some not so great

1431631 the report confirms the rudd governments commitment to ensuring payments and working arrangements support families choices
1431632 we understand the significant pressures on working families including the costs of raising children and the need to gear family support to the best interests of children
1431633 how to use and abuse the gaming press and how the gaming press wants to use and abuse you
1431634 in particular consumers appear to be indifferent to the proliferation of sequels indicating a slow start to holiday sales and risk of continuing weakness
1431635 henry jenkins has cited the fact that media messages are most effective when they tend to reinforce the values beliefs and preconceptions of the reader listener or viewer
1431636 the conscious use of skill and creative imagination especially in the production of aesthetic objects also works so produced
1431637 i did indeed consider video games inherently inferior to film and literature there is a structural reason for that video games by their nature require player choices which is the opposite of the strategy of serious film and literature which requires authorial control t he nature of the medium prevents it from moving beyond craftsmanship however elegant or sophisticated to the stature of art to my knowledge no one in or out of the field has ever been able to cite a game worthy of comparison with the great dramatists poets filmmakers novelists and composers for most gamers video games represent a loss of those precious hours we have available to make ourselves more cultured civilized and empathetic
1431638 art is something that radiates the artist the person who creates that piece of art if 100 people walk by and a single person is captivated by whatever that piece radiates its art but videogames arent trying to capture one person a videogame should make sure that all 100 people that play that game should enjoy the service provided by that videogame its something of a service its not art but i guess the way of providing service with that videogame is an artistic style a form of art
1431639 lets be clear here all games are art in a superficial sense we could point to examples of in game assets which could be described as professionally competent and well produced in a higher sense we look for works that create new expressive experiences or push a medium to places it hasnt gone before
1431640 art is the stuff you find in the museum whether it be a painting or a statue what im doing what videogame creators are doing is running the museum how do we light up things where do we place things how do we sell tickets its basically running the museum for those who come to the museum to look at the art for better or worse what i do hideo kojima myself is run the museum and also create the art thats displayed in the museum
1431641 maybe lets say theres a game out there where theres a boss that you cannot defeat its made that way normally when you beat the boss in a game theres a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment but if you cant beat the boss at all if what youre left with is a sense of loss then maybe that could be defined as art
1431642 thats why you want to think about art and videogames i think the lousiest videogames can be considered art because bad games with no fun arent really games by definition
1431643 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting family members this morning
1431644 he was walking this morning and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible

1431647 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1431648 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was

1431652 when you throw the ball in from the top of the key into the post youd like to have the defender on dwight howards back
1431653 there have been a number of times in this exhibition tour when he has not guarded the ball particularly well patrick mills takes advantage of that
1431654 oh no thats just too fast in the shot clock and he didnt move any defenders

1431657 for over 30 years now millions of americans have played video and computer games and this pastime has become an important part of american culture yet as this entertainment medium grows it has also become a frequent target of criticism and legislation the video game voters network working to protect the rights of americans who play video games and is first line of defense against legislative threats the network enables you to stay updated about issues and to voice your concerns to your elected officials whats really at stake government regulation based on games content will stifle creativity and inadvertently cause game publishers to dilute content due to the threat of government action and fines game content is constitutionally protected just like movies books and cable tv so why should games be subject to a higher level of scrutiny these legislative threats would create a double standard for this innovative medium join today and take a stand protect your games
1431658 no pressure no demographics we just tried to make each other laugh

1431660 in a slowing nationwide economy we remain focused on keeping our position as a preferred convenient and affordable vacation alternative for families said chief operating officer kimberly schaefer
1431661 our guests typically live within a few hours drive of our resorts which means that rising gasoline prices have only a minimal impact on the typical familys cost of a great wolf resort vacation
1431662 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1431663 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1431664 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves

1431667 the sensitivities of the germans are similar to those of the japanese they are sure to understand the cruelty of the bombing
1431668 we came away from the wachovia sell side meeting with a clear feeling that mr steel is a credible accountable action oriented leader who is trying to get his hands around the issues at wachovia as quickly as possible
1431669 we continue to believe that there are no easy fixes here and in our opinion restructuring this balance sheet will take time in what is a difficult and volatile market and would probably not come without more pain for existing shareholders
1431670 even though our refined products transportation volumes were down 2 5 percent compared to last year our companys fee based pipeline and terminal services continued to generate solid results

1431676 at this time we expect fiscal 2009 revenues to be above fiscal 2008 revenues
1431677 however it appears increasingly possible that fiscal 2009 could see modest if any growth in worldwide air traffic
1431678 we remain cautions on the company for the long term as rising credit cost and capital levels remain the primary concern
1431679 we are pleased with the operating results of our fiscal 2008 third quarter particularly in light of the uncertainties in both the general economy as well as the commercial airline industry
1431680 tal vez haya tiempos mejores pero ste es el nuestro
1431681 midway continues to struggle as it lacks sufficient scale product quality and properly targeted titles to capitalize on the current industry profile
1431682 we also believe its cost structure is not optimized to deliver profitability within the boundaries of its current revenue
1431683 we note that the release dates for two games have slipped recently the wheelman and this is vegas from 2008 into 2009
1431684 the company confirmed the slips and appears unlikely to deliver as much upside revenue upside as we had modeled previously
1431685 the low point in its turnaround story quite a while ago its path to profitability remains steep
1431686 consider for example the operator avg which returns the average of its arguments it could be defined as a function but there is a good case for defining it as a macro because the function version would entail an unnecessary call to length each time avg was called at compile time we may not know the values of the arguments but we do know how many there are so the call to length could just as well be made then
1431687 dolist equivalent for simple vector iterate over array elements up to either fill pointer if there is a fill pointer or array total size
1431688 assume data in array is contiguous starting at position zero either return the fill pointer or an equivalent calculated value for the last non nil value in the array this would be more efficient using a divide and conquer approach
1431689 avoid consing up a new list eg by calling coerce return the avg

1431692 anybody obama who says that we can achieve energy independence without using or increasing these resources either does not have the experience or is not giving the american people some straight talk
1431693 my interest is in making sure weve got the kind of comprehensive energy policy that can bring down gas prices
1431694 if in order to get that passed we have to compromise in terms of a careful well thought out drilling strategy that was carefully circumscribed to avoid significant environmental damage i dont want to be so rigid that we cant get something done
1431695 i think its important for the american people to understand were not going to drill our way out of this problem
1431696 scientists are people too and its time we started treating them that way

1431699 john mccain wants to talk about paris hilton and brittany spears thats his idea of a really relevant campaign
1431700 but i dont have time to deal with that mess because america is facing some serious problems america is facing some serious challenges
1431701 ted and i are going to hit back when they get nasty
1431702 when john mccains campaign goes out there and starts saying things like id rather lose the war to an election or when he says that somehow i didnt want to visit the troops in germany even though every reporter says thats not true well youre not trying to solve problems
1431703 all youre trying to do is divide people so you can win an election thats nothing to be proud of lets have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in peoples lives
1431704 the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least seven years its not a real solution its a political answer of the sort washington engages in every few years
1431705 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to offshore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1431706 it underscores that barack obama isnt being straightforward with voters and has the bad judgment americans cant afford right now
1431707 its important to look to the future instead of the short term you dont want to just come up with quick fixes

1431715 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
1431716 i believe that marriages that have been entered into subsequent to the may 15 supreme court opinion will be recognized by the california supreme court
1431717 i would think the court in looking at the underlying equities would most probably conclude that upholding the marriages performed in that interval before the election would be a just result
1431718 same sex unions are not the same as opposite sex unions

1431736 it becomes its not just our union it becomes a political message theyre trying to get out
1431737 if i had my preference i wouldnt bring politics into it but we just cant lose the moment and the opportunity when so many friends and family are together
1431738 but we have to do double duty theres no other choice
1431739 i couldnt bear the thought of getting more things to dust in our home
1431740 we thought the best thing we could do is to direct people to give in honor of our wedding

1431854 the latest data shows that out of all u s entering freshmen declaring a major in computer science african american women made up only 3 3 percent the fact is that women are not choosing technology and this is a dangerous predicament when you couple that with the fact that it is estimated that 75 percent of all jobs by the year 2020 will require a technology background it becomes a crisis call
1431855 whats offensive about this complaint is that it suggests something he did was intended to be prurient and nothing could be further from the truth
1431856 it was intended just to make the patient feel better

1431858 renowned as a jovial guy and regarded as a doctor who has terrific relations with his patients and with his staff
1431859 he vigorously denies that any action of his was intended to offend the patient
1431860 are like childrens tattoos kids put them on themselves and they wash right off
1431861 you cannot do something like this even as a joke

1431870 well today is my last day on this earth better make the most of it
1431871 but in my early 20s i used to want to be a princess but i didnt want to have to marry somebody in order to do it of course i dont see the position of first lady as a princess where its something you have to marry into with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning without michelle he wouldnt be there
1431872 so warm and so gracious shes got that direct eye contact truly connecting thing shes not a ha ha ha type
1431873 being first lady is not just about being the wife but really taking command and having true vision
1431874 hillary clinton was on my show in january and i asked her do you ever just get terrified to say anything because everything is so scrutinized and picked apart and dissected and she said honestly tyra yes and its the same for michelle obama especially with her and barack being the first you know in so so many ways
1431875 yay some honest to goodness knitting content finally she has an fo to show off
1431876 thats something you always wonder if a guy is going to be satisfied
1431877 as an athlete and a competitor you never lose that edge
1431878 thats something you always have and something that makes you a better football player youre never satisfied where you are and its all about where you want to go we are all working very hard to be better football players than we were last year and to be a better unit than we were last year dont get me wrong its exciting to have the same group working together just like last season and it will only benefit us but none of us is satisfied and none of us is complacent thats just the mentality of our group we are going to work as hard as we can whether its taking the time on the field or in the meeting room to make our line one of the best in the nfl
1431879 there are guys breathing up our necks because they want to play
1431880 if you are here you want to start and you never want to stop fighting you always have guys pushing you if you have that complacent attitude youre never going to get any better you have to go out there and prove yourself over again and get better everybody they bring in is trying to take your job so you have to keep fighting
1431881 i think you are always preparing i think i always have that mentality and that mindset that i have to prove myself and make the team ive never really known any other way my first four years in the nfl every year i had to make sure i had a spot on the team and i think that mentality has served me well in my offseason preparation and leading up to training camp i dont think ive ever approached a preseason or a training camp and said i have a spot on the team and a job so im not going to work hard i dont think i would ever allow myself to do that and i dont think my teammates would either
1431882 regardless of how many years you may have in the nfl every year youre fighting for your job
1431883 you never know what young guy could be coming in or what the staff is looking at so you have to come with the mindset of continuously improving getting better as a player and being smarter
1431884 i like their approach in everything that theyre doing its good theres no question about it theres nobody that slacks everybody is on top of things there are going to be mental errors especially with the new guys but you know that will hopefully dwindle down and well get that corrected
1431885 you say that were all starting but we dont look at it that way
1431886 we look at it as just finding ways to improve every day we are not even close to where we have to be right now so our goal is just to get ready for that opening game i think we have the type of guys that know what we have to improve on and weve had meetings where we said we werent good here and here and we know that those are areas goal line and short yardage that fall solely on us up front those are areas we have to get better at
1431887 there is always room for improvement and i think thats the whole lines mentality we do have a great group we constantly push each other and we dont let each other slide on very many things i include our o line coaches flaherty and assistant dave deguglielmo they dont let us get away with much either its a good working group
1431888 just the way ive gone about things preparing for the season there is no cramming for training camp you cant wait until the week before decide you are going to work out three times a day and then all of a sudden be ready for camp it takes time and you have to put in the time and ive always lived by that motto the more you sweat the less you bleed i think coming into the nfl as a free agent i really learned about work ethic and what its going to take as much as it takes physically lifting running training i think in addition it prepares you mentally for the season because mentally you have the confidence that you put in the time and youre strong enough and in good enough shape for the season
1431889 we are always lifting together running together spending the offseason together and on the field we look out for each other and help each other out
1431890 we have goals for ourselves and we want to be one of the best groups in the nfl the only way you get there is through hard work and sticking together through tough times and making improvements week in and week out and thats the best thing about our guys were a blue collar group of guys we work hard we believe in one another and we believe in our offense and the players in it
1431891 but it was going on for a couple of days and we wanted to see what it was
1431892 thats why we go through all this training camp to play in a game against a different opponent
1431893 i look forward to getting out there and getting used to the speed of the game
1431894 the positions that have the depth well do a good job with rotating those guys in
1431895 the positions that dont have a lot of depth basically the ones will play about a quarter and then the twos and threes will play the rest of the game
1431896 probably not in this game but maybe one time you want to look at the deferment aspect of it
1431897 there was some talk of having a safety be your second guy but we are going to go with the linebackers being on the same frequency with the quarterback and the middle linebacker you are hoping that in some of the places that we travel that that is not an issue you have to be sharp with your signals all the time but it will be interesting to work a lot of that stuff out and kind of another fun thing for us because we do have a couple of different issues
1431898 im just getting used to having somebody in my helmet
1431899 right now its uncomfortable i dont know how its going to work out but well have a backup plan
1431900 im not sure exactly what that means in terms of when he will play but thats better than the information weve been getting
1431901 id have to say i model my game after ed reed and sean taylor
1431902 those are the two guys i wanted to be like i want to hit like sean and be a ball hawk like ed so i just watched what those guys did and took something from them
1431903 they both were pretty similar but in the end i decided to stay closer to home miami almost everybody there recruited me
1431904 the talent is there but there have just been a lot of changes
1431905 weve just went through new coaches new coordinators and each year weve had a new staff and a bunch of young players trying to adjust to it
1431906 i feel that my role changed a lot my freshman year i was able to do whatever then to having to make a lot of calls and playing with a bunch of young guys my role definitely changed they expected a lot out of me and i put a lot of pressure on myself but i think i handled it well
1431907 i look at it as a blessing they already paved the way for me
1431908 you go to miami and play safety its kind of automatic as far as getting to the nfl especially when they come back and teach you how to be successful a lot of people say there is pressure and big shoes to fill but i dont look at it that way
1431909 i just have to say the guys that come back to teach you when i first got there i had brandon meriweather teaching me and ed reed taught me a few things they just want you to be successful so every time a safety comes along that they feel is going to be pretty good they just coach them up
1431910 i guess its just the way we play the game we play real violent talk a lot of trash from the outside looking in were bad people but they dont really know were all great people and they are kind of changing that image a little bit now
1431911 i didnt get any phone calls i hated the draft process i really did i didnt enjoy it certain football media types were bad mouthing me so i hated that process i really did
1431912 i now feel that i have a chip on my shoulder
1431913 if you dont then i dont know why you wouldnt there were 30 teams that said you werent good enough to play for us i definitely was surprised i dont listen to all the talk but after not hearing my name called it was like wow this is messed up
1431914 i was very excited when i got the call and found out i was a new york giant
1431915 it definitely has helped down in miami it isnt as bad media wise as up here but you get it when youre not doing well they want to win at um and i love that there were times that fans would try to spit on us and throw bottles and it got really bad its not that big of a change and i think im ready for it
1431916 he is always available when you need that extra time he makes it as simple as possible so you dont have to think too much so he has made my transition much easier
1431917 i think the amount of people we have makes for good competition but its not just the amount of people but the quality of the people they can all be starters so i think we are all pushing each other to make ourselves better we are not putting added pressure on ourselves we feel that coach is going to make the right decision
1431918 the first one i just want to go out there and get this started
1431919 that person in there is sick or hurt somehow do you want to abandon a fellow human being in agony
1431920 but maman and da placed us in the care of the landlord while they went into london and the landlord said
1431921 the landlord ignored this ladys cries for help he said the gentleman who rented the room was respectable and paid a great price he only cares about the money and about making sure that we stay in our rooms like proper young ladies
1431922 what if maman and da discover what weve been doing
1431923 we wouldnt be at this nasty little inn if maman and da hadnt wanted to visit the moneylender once they receive my dowry from lord rawson theyll be flush with coin once more and we wont have to stay in these terrible places
1431924 once they receive your dowry youll be wed and youll not be with us in these terrible places
1431925 so maman and da will live with the consequences of our adventure if they find out
1431926 you can go back to our room if you wish ill handle this without your help
1431927 good ill need you if this is as bad as it sounds
1431928 would you mind a whole lot pulling your leg into the car so i can kind of shut the door or should i open it all the way so you can fall out
1431929 awfully sorry but i dont have it any more i was compelled to sell it
1431930 she also opens up a lot right before she goes to sleep when i am saying prayers with her and telling her good night
1431931 5 kids 2 labs 1 lizard and a hermit crab
1431932 im telling you we are going to attack this hard knocks the same way we have attacked all of the other hard knocks were not going to make this an e half hour entertainment show on tony romo and jessica simpson
1431933 nothing is inexorable but love love which will yield to prayer is imperfect and poor nor is it then the love that yields but its alloy for love loves unto purity love has ever in view the absolute loveliness of that which it beholds where loveliness is incomplete and love cannot love its fill of loving it spends itself to make more lovely that it may love more it strives for perfection even that itself may be perfected not in itself but in the object therefore all that is not beautiful in the beloved all that comes between and is not of loves kind must be destroyed and our god is a consuming fire
1431934 our aclu chapter has received several complaints from inmates and their families regarding prison health services treatment the public defenders office has reported roughly a hundred complaints including a dozen or so cases in which the defendants were incapable of assisting in their own defense
1431935 we must remember that these inmates have been charged but not convicted of any crime their dignity as well as mental health must be respected and maintained
1431936 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1431937 consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information
1431938 semantic technologies are early in their maturity and market adoption
1431939 many organizations will struggle to understand semantic approaches and view such technology as bleeding edge avoiding it because they are risk averse
1431940 sharing of information is getting more and more important all the time for organizations as they try to achieve greater levels of productivity agility and simply make their organizations more effective
1431941 theyve got these silos of information across the business people dont really understand where information resides what it looks like what it means or the semantics around it and as such they find it difficult to share in effect they are talking different languages
1431942 basically the amount of data is growing not only in volume but the number of different sources it is coming from
1431943 its beyond the capabilities of the average organization to handle all of this the pain level is pretty high and growing its a balance between that pain level and any pain level associated with doing something new
1431944 one of the truisms of life is that human knowledge is massive
1431945 many evolutionary biologists have argued that the different forms of crimson rosellas arose or speciated through ring speciation
1431946 i have no hard feelings and i mean that truly
1431947 i think he still has the ability to help a ballclub
1431948 its hawkish enough for people who are concerned about inflation but the fact that there are dissenters proves that this opinion is not unanimous
1431949 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1431950 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1431951 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1431952 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1431953 washingtons broken john mccain knows it were worse off than we were four years ago
1431954 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties
1431955 hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1431956 the truth is being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1431957 four years more of the same failed policies that have gotten us where we are
1431958 in this election sen mccain has proposed an energy plan thats nothing but four years more of the same
1431959 may i say to you is there anybody as tired of paying 4 a gallon for gasoline is there anybody sick and tired of it is there anybody that wants to become energy independent
1431960 tell them to get back to work tell them to get to work when im president of the united states im not going to let them go on vacation were not going to pay 4 a gallon for gas because were going to drill offshore and were going to drill now were going to drill here were going to drill now
1431961 iran is ready to provide a clear response to your proposal at the earliest possibility while simultaneously expecting to receive your clear response to our questions and ambiguities as well

1431966 the most wonderful of all things in life i believe is the discovery of another human being with whom ones relationship has a glowing depth beauty and joy as the years increase this inner progressiveness of love between two human beings is a most marvelous thing it cannot be found by looking for it or by passionately wishing for it it is a sort of divine accident
1431967 relationships of trust depend on our willingness to look not only to our own interests but also the interests of others
1431968 the best and most beautiful things in the world can not be seen or ever touched they must be felt with the heart we should do everything within reason to save a good relationship but if we are constantly trying to save it its probably not a good relationship
1431969 love is what is left in a relationship after all the selfishness has been removed
1431970 it does not need that a poem should be long every word was once a poem every new relationship is a new word
1431971 the future of religion is connected with the possibility of developing a faith in the possibilities of human experience and human relationships that will create a vital sense of the solidarity of human interests and inspire action to make that sense a reality
1431972 human relationships always help us to carry on because they always presuppose further developments a future and also because we live as if our only task was precisely to have relationships with other people
1431973 you can educate yourself right out of a relationship with god
1431974 intimate relationships cannot substitute for a life plan but to have any meaning or viability at all a life plan must include intimate relationships
1431975 todays sensitive male has learned to share in open frank discussions about relationships like where the hell did you get a crazy idea like that
1431976 anger repressed can poison a relationship as surely as the cruelest words
1431977 relationships of trust depend on our willingness to look not only to our own interests but also the interests of others
1431978 you do not need to be loved not at the cost of yourself the single relationship that is truly central and crucial in a life is the relationship to the self of all the people you will know in a lifetime you are the only one you will never lose
1431979 religion holds the solution to all problems of human relationship whether they are between parents and children or nation and nation sooner or later man has always had to decide whether he worships his own power or the power of god
1431980 he is not a perfect performer of the duties of relationship who doeth good to his relatives as they do good to him he is perfect who doeth good to his relatives when they do not do good to him
1431981 relationships are like rome difficult to start out incredible during the prosperity of the golden age and unbearable during the fall then a new kingdom will come along and the whole process will repeat itself until you come across a kingdom like egypt that thrives and continues to flourish this kingdom will become your best friend your soulmate and your love
1431982 all men hate to hear we need to talk about our relationship these seven words strike fear in the heart of even general schwartzkopf
1431983 self respect and a clear conscience are powerful components of integrity and are the basis for enriching your relationships with others
1431984 when the body sinks into death the essence of man is revealed man is a knot a web a mesh into which relationships are tied only those relationships matter the body is an old crock that nobody will miss i have never known a man to think of himself when dying never
1431985 no partner in a love relationship should feel that he has to give up an essential part of himself to make it viable
1431986 we have so little faith in the ebb and flow of life of love of relationships we leap at the flow of time and resist in terror its ebb we are afraid it will never return we insist on permanency on duration on continuity when the only continuity possible in life as in love is in growth in fluidity in freedom
1431987 for women talk is the glue that holds relationships together it creates connections between people and a sense of community for men activities hold relationships together talk is used to negotiate their position in a group and preserve independence

1432101 in spite of difficult economic conditions in several of our key markets our parks performed reasonably well during the first half of 2008
1432102 through the end of the second quarter our parks entertained 7 6 million visitors average in park guest per capita spending was 40 45 and out of park revenues totaled 40 5 million this compares with attendance of 6 7 million average in park guest per capita spending of 40 68 and out of park revenues of 38 3 million through the second quarter of 2007

1432105 in general we are pleased with the performance of our parks through july
1432106 when we purchased the paramount parks in june of 2006 we believed these parks operated in stronger regional markets when compared with our legacy parks this geographic diversification has proven to be beneficial to us thus far as we continue to see strength in the toronto market along with the washington d c charlotte and san francisco markets these stronger markets have helped to balance some of the early season softness we experienced from the detroit cleveland and minneapolis st paul markets where several of our legacy parks operate
1432107 we ended the second quarter of 2008 in sound financial condition in terms of both liquidity and cash flow
1432108 although attendance and revenue expectations through july were higher than we achieved we are satisfied with our results particularly given the continued pressures on the discretionary dollar as a result of higher gas prices and current economic conditions
1432109 with approximately 45 of our budgeted attendance still ahead of us it is imperative that we continue the positive momentum we experienced during the month of july into the other peak vacation month of august and the important fall season we are hopeful we will continue to see growth in attendance while maintaining the in park guest per capita spending as families continue to look for entertainment closer to home at this time based on preliminary results through july we are reaffirming our full year guidance of net revenues between 990 million to 1 02 billion and full year adjusted ebitda between 340 355 million

1432146 what happens when it turns back up do the advertisers come back to print
1432147 the pressure on the newspaper industry in western european markets is both structural because of disintermediation by the web and cyclical because of slowing growth rates the cyclical part will return the structural one will not the simple fact is that more people are reading newspapers or newspaper content online rather than offline circulation among young people is down and regional newspapers and newspapers that depend on classified are under tremendous pressure this is where the structural impact will be greatest
1432148 online competition will have an effect on what they can charge for print pricing until they are reduced to the local advertiser base who have no option but to buy their advertising there
1432149 with costs rising and revenues falling we would expect the closures of titles if not whole publishers this year or next
1432150 the primary cause of the sharp downturn we have seen lies in the economy
1432151 thats not to deny there are structural changes but the biggest factor is the performance of the uk economy
1432152 if you are a retailer or a car manufacturer or a financial institution and your revenues are under pressure as much as you know its the wrong thing to do you cut advertising when it comes down to it everyone cuts advertising
1432153 this is the first time we have seen the impact of the internet in a downturn
1432154 the internet alternative is cheaper and people are using it in more recessive times online is increasing its share and will not necessarily give it up when things improve
1432155 thats a structural change and were not going to see it return in the foreseeable future
1432156 retail is what will make or break the national press and you have got to say its not looking good
1432157 the final three months of the year in the run up to christmas would be critical
1432158 the prospects of a fourth quarter spike are looking more remote
1432159 national newspaper advertising means display ads which have been more resilient there is not the same threat as with the regional newspaper sector
1432160 however some of the concerns expressed by the public companies are certainly not unique in the sector there is the double blow of the competitive threat of the internet and a difficult market

1432305 the same sort of bureaucracy exists now that existed in the 1950s when the tests were going on in top secret

1432307 we decided to improve the display so that visitors spend more time to learn the horror of the bombing
1432308 to me and to many of the survivors this museum has become way too clean and pretty and not shocking
1432309 when this museum was opened in 1955 it was much more shocking and it has been gradually cleaned up and made more like a professional museum
1432310 when you go through here you should be shocked you should be frightened

1432348 when we started this work we started to think we were making something like electronic gospel a music where singing was the central event but whose sonic landscapes were not the type normally associated with that way of singing
1432349 this thought tapped into my long love affair with gospel music which curiously was inadvertently initiated by david and the talking heads
1432350 the live shows will maybe try to draw a line linking this new material with what we did 30 years ago a little bit anyway

1432352 and i figured i should get my ass on the road while the shrub is still in office a lot has happened in the world and in my life since i last did this six years ago and theres no better thrill and no better therapy than getting on that high wire in front of a live audience

1432358 our approach for classes in diablo iii is that we dont have a strong desire to bring back classes from the previous game
1432359 the goal is to try and give people new gameplay and not just re hash old gameplay were not just making a diablo ii with updated 3d graphics
1432360 the problem was we looked at the class and didnt think that we could really make him a lot better
1432361 we could add some new stuff to him but for the most part curses corpse explosion skeleton pets done thats the class we wanted to create new gameplay so we chose to do the witch doctor as a different kind of class
1432362 if the necromancer dealt damage it was through corpses laying around or through his pets
1432363 the witch doctor his pets are a little more transient if you watch the gameplay video you really notice his pets come and go like crazy theres a wall of zombies that go away fairly quickly or pets that just kind of blow up willy nilly that was intentional to try and make him different than the necromancer
1432364 theres a lot of people on our team who arent happy with our class choices
1432365 but after weve established diablo iii as its own game with its own type of gameplay and experiences i wouldnt be opposed to looking at old classes we are trying to design the witch doctor class so that if we did bring back the necromancer theres room for him were looking out ahead of time at what our expansions are going to be so weve got to keep room open for some of those other classes down the road
1432366 its one of those things where unless we put like 30 classes in the game people are going to be unhappy but if we put 30 classes in the game wed hurt the game i think that of the classes that weve chosen there will be something for everyone im not worried that people wont be able to find a class that they like to play

1432378 i love writer mark millar and i like the idea of registering superheroes but if you buy into that you have to take it all the way you have to register
1432379 now that must be a sucky job right so who gets to do it the plot is about the two s h i e l d agents that have the thankless job of registering man thing and how things go horribly awry
1432380 i took the core conceits of the character he used to be ted sallis a scientist and he roams the everglades
1432381 other than that i didnt have a lot of room to fit in more continuity i would love to sometime i think man thing and the nexus of realities are both wonderful toys in marvels sandbox
1432382 writers are by nature verbose so its a good exercise in self restraint to write a mute mindless character you dont have to get in the characters head you have to get in the heads of the people that react to man thing how others react to man thing will always drive man thing stories
1432383 i like the idea that hes just a big force of nature
1432384 hes a walking venus flytrap he doesnt have a mind or muscles or just a plant that reacts to fear its a simple yet endearing concept

1432442 i cant believe that any true dog lover would condone causing suffering to dogs and wasting their lives for such a trivial and selfish purpose particularly when animal shelters worldwide have thousands of dogs who need loving homes
1432443 women are more than smart enough to see that mccains policies are a disaster
1432444 its not an independent position to put it mildly i would rather see her as the president of the senate
1432445 what we have done so far is only count the kind of experience that men also have what we need to be able to do is count all human experience so i would like to count the secretarial positions as good training places to take over the jobs of the bosses
1432446 heres an analogy it doesnt make sense to say is cancer heredity or carcinogens because its both but it would be good for the country and for our political and physical health to get rid of misogyny and get rid of carcinogens
1432447 a university of minnesota research team found that pin up images of a female athlete dont do much to advance womens sports the core fan base women ages 18 to 55 and fathers with daughters were all discouraged by such images in the study
1432448 the younger male subjects who enjoyed the images did not share the same level of interest for the associated sport in short sex may sell some magazines but it doesnt help bring in the fans

1432455 the bbc has chosen to defend some transphobic comments made by a gay comedian whose show they sponsor in this clip where hes talking about thomas beatie he says if he hasnt had genital surgery surely that just makes him a lesbian and that thing is still a woman
1432456 not only have they completely misunderstood my comment theyve dismissed it in a really aggravating generic response way
1432457 the bbc is paid for directly through each households tv licence
1432458 why is it that the dehumanization of a person group of people is still considered funny

1432462 rather than focusing her comments of neanderthal attitudes of some employers she is missing the point that maternity and parental rights are good for employers parents and the wider economy it seems that nicola brewer is penalising women for having babies in employment while implying that women should go back to the kitchen sink and have no aspirations for a career ms brewers justification for this is a back lash from employers that they stop employing women of child bearing age

1432471 the sites tone does actually lean towards the more feminine as you can tell but after doing some research we found that 80 percent of the money that is spent in stores malls and online is spent by women which is why bfs invokes a feminine spin
1432472 we do have male users on the site and also store owners in the bfs mall who are male and listing a variety of products including items like motorcycles

1432486 yeah whatever im just gonna say sorry and things are solved
1432487 well maybe hes just that kind of guy that rarely calls
1432488 if you start to feel somethings not right with him then you should start watching really carefully
1432489 guy under this sign usually shows something that is totally different right in front and behind you

1432496 together with the entire nation he lived through a great tragedy of repression
1432497 he not only lived through it but through his works and his entire life he inoculated our society against tyranny in all its forms
1432498 he is a great citizen of russia and my favourite writer
1432499 my favorite novel is cancer ward there is so much optimism in it so much life affirmation he never forces his ideas upon you but rather asks you to meditate and you come to understand its seriousness and greatness yourself
1432500 his novels are about a period that is too distant for young people
1432501 youth today are already children born in the 1980s and his novels are about periods of repression and war
1432502 there are things that i wish id urged her to do things i wish id said things i wish i hadnt said
1432503 theres been a concentrated effort over the past 20 years to improve our knowledge and expertise working with elephants and bulls

1432505 theres nothing like being up close to them to realize the size and beauty and intelligence
1432506 obama is a tad cooler than mccain on probably 57 fronts
1432507 obamas better looking than mccain obamas more stylish than mccain obamas more fit than mccain he refers to better music than mccain
1432508 mccain that guys not cool i just cant call mccain cool
1432509 hes younger i think he has more of a connection with my generation i just think he communicates better to my generation especially with issues in iraq mccain is all right but not as cool as obama
1432510 what obamas been able to do is capitalize on his hipness at least as far as younger voters go
1432511 i think its not that they dont support his issues and his policies but younger voters are more willing to work for him and work passionately for him because hes someone who resonates more on their wavelength
1432512 look at hugh hefner hell be cool til the day he dies but for him and for ron paul or anybody whos elderly and whos cool part of it is what they represent that makes them that
1432513 the most important thing in terms of reaching youth is not being cool its being authentic or true to who you are
1432514 i think hed look ridiculous if he tried to purposefully seem younger than he is if he started doing extreme sports or something ridiculous
1432515 has a very conservative image and that doesnt really help him either
1432516 shes not the type like obamas wife who can get down and dirty with younger people and really relate to them
1432517 its quite clear to us that the human rights situation has deteriorated because of the olympics
1432518 we are looking for a clear positive response from iran and in the absence of that were going to have no choice but to pursue further measures against them
1432519 there are whole segments of the population that prefer being in the company of dogs than people and im not sure thats such a negative thing
1432520 people strongly attached to their pet dogs do not turn to pet dogs as substitutes for failed interactions with humans
1432521 humans tend to be very disappointing notice our divorce rate
1432522 dogs are not hurtful and humans are people are inconsistent and dogs are fairly consistent
1432523 if you grew up in an atmosphere where you were abused youre not going to have a high regard for people

1432526 but there are a ton of things they dont want they want cloth but not clothes overall they dont want to be farmers living on small farms they are very well aware of what a small farm holder is and they know some of the native people are trying it the government wants them to be civilized so some of the trade products become very symbolic
1432527 it was probably somebodys job because everybody has to be employed
1432528 so there was no need for volunteers to do it
1432529 typically there are not a lot of adults available to teens in the czech republic
1432530 theyre busy or working youths need people who are older than them who care about them spend time with them and are there unconditionally for them
1432531 kids have opportunities today their parents never would have dreamed of
1432532 theyre the first generation thats grown up with freedom so theyre figuring it out on their own because their parents grew up differently
1432533 the rules are difficult to explain to kids without a baseball background
1432534 you have to rely on other people a lot so you feel like youve lost your sense of independence
1432535 i think especially under communism you were very close with your immediate family and you could trust those people but you really just didnt know who else you could trust
1432536 so people are very careful about what they say and how they welcome new people and strangers
1432537 i think the first time we were aware of it we invited a couple over
1432538 when you get into another culture these are the quirks you have to learn
1432539 my own belief is that having the opportunity to serve and an opportunity to volunteer is a way to give back to the community and young people and i think that adds to my quality of life
1432540 its something thats important to me and it brings me satisfaction
1432541 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1432542 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1432543 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1432544 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1432545 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1432546 at the end of the day well have to achieve agreement and it remains to be seen whether the government will find this an acceptable attractive alternative to what theyve already proposed
1432547 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1432548 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1432549 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1432550 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1432551 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1432552 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1432553 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1432554 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1432555 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1432556 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1432557 french soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis
1432558 could be the basis for potential charges against individuals or the state
1432559 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1432560 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1432561 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable
1432562 that sounds like chelsea but no way is that her

1432568 we are just trying to get those guys to get their feet wet and acclimate to the speed it is a big difference from high school to a major college program
1432569 we are trying to rest some of our varsity players and give the others some reps to see what we got
1432570 he can run and he is big and strong he was really good out there
1432571 i decided i wanted to put a stop to that in the early stages
1432572 who can try tasks on their own but still need help troubleshooting
1432573 when we seek out the big picture and most significantly are able to correct our previously poor performance we can look back at what we did and revise our approach
1432574 with the world view and skills so ingrained that we have phenomenal instincts that let us zen in on the answer immediately without higher level analysis
1432575 its imperative to bring viewers compelling tv that exposes a horrific issue like the michael vick case and highlights the aftermath of its investigation
1432576 bringing to the forefront the entire case with firsthand accounts and rarely seen footage animal planet hopes that this eye opener has a strong impact on our audience and on dogs lives
1432577 dog fighting really is an underground world the professional fighters are very sophisticated and they take great care to make sure law enforcement doesnt find out about it
1432578 cesars work is phenomenal its really working i am the pack leader now
1432579 to see a dog being rehabilitated is beautiful but to see a human really stepping up to the plate and practicing calm assertive energy its a beautiful thing
1432580 pit bulls rottweilers and german shepherds are all amazing dogs which have the ability to become gentle and loving pets
1432581 in my opinion to judge a dog by its breed is terribly unfair i always say that when a dog has issues its not the breed its the person behind the breed

1432586 flying right over the heart of hanoi in a dive at about 4 500 feet when a russian missile the size of a telephone pole came up the sky was full of them and blew the right wing off my skyhawk dive bomber
1432587 i pulled the ejection handle and was knocked unconscious by the force of the ejection the air speed was about 500 knots
1432588 i hit the water and sank to the bottom i did not feel any pain at the time and i was able to rise to the surface i took a breath of air and started sinking again
1432589 o k ill give you military information if you will take me to the hospital
1432590 demands for military information were accompanied by threats to terminate my medical treatment if i mccain did not cooperate eventually i gave them my ships name and squadron number and confirmed that my target had been the power plant
1432591 to a question of the correspondent mccain answered my assignment to the oriskany i told myself was due to serious losses in pilots which were sustained by this aircraft carrier due to its raids on the north vietnam territory vna and which necessitated replacements
1432592 a meeting which will leave its mark on my life
1432593 my meeting with john sidney mccain was certainly one of those meetings which will affect me most profoundly for the rest of my life
1432594 many visitors came to talk to me john mccain not all of it was for interrogation once a famous north vietnamese writer an old man with a ho chi minh beard came to my room wanting to know all about ernest hemingway others came to find out about life in the united states they figured because my father had such high military rank that i was of the royalty or governing circle one of the men who came to see me whose picture i recognized later was gen vo nguyen giap the hero of dienbienphu
1432595 another end of the camp a place we called the corn crib
1432596 they were the first three pows to be released by the north vietnamese
1432597 moved into another building the largest cell block in the camp the warehouse
1432598 in may of 1968 i mccain was interviewed by two north vietnamese generals at separate times
1432599 a second vietnamese known as the rabbit stood by to serve as translator
1432600 commander mccain feared that if he was released before the war is over president lyndon johnson might cause difficulties for his father because people will wonder if mccain had been brainwashed
1432601 reds say pw songbird is pilot son of admiral hanoi has aired a broadcast in which the pilot son of united states commander in the pacific adm john mccain purportedly admits to having bombed civilian targets in north vietnam and praises medical treatment he has received since being taken prisoner
1432602 the english language broadcast beamed at south vietnam was one of a series using american prisoners it was in response to a plea by defense secretary melvin s laird may 19 that north vietnam treat prisoners according to the humanitarian standards set forth by the geneva convention
1432603 there was pressure to see american antiwar delegations which seemed to increase as the time went on but there wasnt any torture in january 1970 i mccain was taken to a quiz with the cat he told me that he wanted me to see a foreign guest
1432604 between the two of us its our belief and to the best of our knowledge that no prisoner was beaten or harmed physically in that camp known as
1432605 my only contention with the mccain deal is that while he was at the plantation to the best of my knowledge and teds knowledge he was not physically abused in any way no one was in that camp it was the camp that people were released from
1432606 since the voodoos introduction on tour players continue to provide us with incredible feedback
1432607 although its only been on the tour for a short period of time the voodoo has recorded five wins which we consider the ultimate validation of our new s core technology
1432608 im playing much like i started the year now that its the playoffs i guess ive got a good opportunity now of getting into the finals really gaining some momentum and taking it into next week
1432609 this republican hoax is unworthy of the serious debate we must have to reduce the price at the pump and promote energy independence
1432610 aggressively addressing the range of economic issues confronting american families
1432611 protected homeowners from foreclosure invested in college affordability ensured that women receive equal pay for equal work protected our children from toxic toys and products and made another historic investment in veterans care
1432612 democrats are producing and passing real economic solutions for the american people
1432613 we just kind of made this up at about 11 20 on friday
1432614 to see citizens on the floor of the house the peoples house warms my heart
1432615 i hope this sends a strong message that the american public is starting to feel like theyre being energized that theyre being given a sounding board that theyre becoming an echo chamber for their own point of view and that there are some people that are speaking to their issues and voicing their concerns
1432616 my hope is that as we stay consistent and focused and provide a respectful debate on the floor of the congress that more americans will see that there are members of congress that want to be working and are ready to role our sleeves up and achieve a bipartisan compromise that includes conservation new technologies fuel efficiency and more drilling
1432617 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1432618 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1432619 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd

1432627 these new fees would not be based on cost recovery
1432628 the boards view is that scope to move towards a less restrictive stance of monetary policy in the period ahead is increasing
1432629 it could be half a per cent cut by christmas
1432630 mental illness is responsible for 13 3 per cent of the total burden of disease in australia and so is clearly one of the most significant conditions for the nation
1432631 move over david duke theres a new racist going for the oval office hillary supporters have seen obama unfairly play the race card time and time again in fact obamas crypto ethnic inflammatory remarks have become the senators number one method of distracting voters from his lack of qualifications numerous flip flops and dangerous associations
1432632 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1432633 obamas race baiting tactics are nothing new he unfairly charged both president bill clinton and geraldine ferraro of racism during the primary and then worked to spin the story to make himself the victim
1432634 obamas statements about race include a subliminal threat branding all white people who oppose him as racists while at the same time appealing to african americans empathy as a victim of racism these tactics are underhanded and i applaud mccain for exposing the senators hypocrisy
1432635 when these players stop by i think it means the world to them
1432636 they see these players as their heroes they arent real people to them so when they walk in here the kids are just stunned
1432637 it is one of those things that helps distract them from what is going on they could be having one of the worst days but when they see someone come in that is famous or an athlete they dont care they will be here for eight hours all of a sudden their attitude has changed and that is really important
1432638 it is just one of those things i am very lucky to be able to do things like that and it is great
1432639 whether you are retired or not you are still a boston bruin to them
1432640 but to me they are ten times tougher than i ever was when i played clearly that fight in the hospital is a bigger fight than i ever had when i was playing for the bruins
1432641 it is touching to be here it is special and i hope that it was as special for them as it was for me because being able to do this is awesome
1432642 any amount of pain that i would be in on this ride is minimal compared to what they are going through
1432643 being able to put a smile on their mom and dads face and on their face for a minute ten minutes whatever it is is a very special thing
1432644 that is what is great about the city of boston that is what is great about the boston bruins the bruins have always been a part of the dana farber
1432645 today i met a patient that i met back in 1991 and he is fighting the good fight
1432646 he was here today for his annual check up and he is going to get a clean bill of health
1432647 we exchanged emails so he is going to send the picture from 91 that he took and i am going to send the picture from today and sign them both so it is pretty cool
1432648 i think more than anything it puts life in perspective
1432649 when you think about lifes issues and what is going on and then you come here and you see the courage and the strength of these young people you just want to put a smile on their face
1432650 were wonderfully surprised its really resonated with women who are taking this issue to heart
1432651 people come to a party enjoy it then host their own
1432652 now it feels safe to go into the shower right after cleaning
1432653 we found more than 200 products containing the chemicals of concern
1432654 a lot of products may say theyre green organic or natural but we dont know if its true
1432655 some of the women were quite shocked about the different toxins they were releasing from everyday products
1432656 and they were shocked to learn its not law that companies list ingredients
1432657 i used every excuse in the book to get to the cottage
1432658 what you see is what you get and unlike timeshares you have 100 per cent ownership
1432659 people love cottaging but they dont want to have to do all the work or have all the headaches
1432660 if you have any thought of buying intervals back to back youd better get in on the ground floor
1432661 whether they cant afford a cottage or they just like the flexibility we are seeing a lot of that now
1432662 our marina is pretty well laid out like a little resort its like cottages in a row
1432663 i havent seen them anywhere else in the caribbean or europe where they usually have just finger slips
1432664 there are party parks for the partiers there are religious parks there are no alcohol parks there are nudist parks
1432665 this is the nirvana of what weve been talking about for years
1432666 solar power has always been a limited far off solution now we can seriously think about solar power as unlimited and soon
1432667 thats why i know this is going to work its so easy to implement
1432668 this is a major discovery with enormous implications for the future prosperity of humankind
1432669 the importance of their discovery cannot be overstated since it opens up the door for developing new technologies for energy production thus reducing our dependence for fossil fuels and addressing the global climate change problem
1432670 the scientific community is really going to run with this
1432671 this discovery in the nocera lab demonstrates that moving up the transformation of our energy supply system to one based on renewables will depend heavily on frontier basic science
1432672 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1432673 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1432674 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1432675 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1432676 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1432677 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1432678 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1432679 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1432680 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1432681 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1432682 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1432683 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1432684 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1432685 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1432686 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1432687 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1432688 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1432689 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked
1432690 a hope in the unseen an american odyssey from the inner city to the ivy league

1432707 i would pay off all of my friends and family member debts and give them some extra money

1432909 the beginning of a move away from republicans could affect local state and national politics over several election cycles
1432910 this is very suggestive that there is a fundamental change going on in the electorate
1432911 obviously these are not good numbers for the republican party to be looking at
1432912 i think the key in this one is where do all these new independent voters break
1432913 major political realignment is not just controlling the branches of government
1432914 it is when you decisively do it we havent seen that in modern generations
1432915 mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1432916 our economy is in turmoil i dont have to tell the people of youngstown
1432917 people here have known some hard knocks and hard times
1432918 cheney met with renewable energy folks once and oil and gas executives 40 times mccain has taken a page out of the cheney playbook
1432919 wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks

1432922 we need more jobs and economic development why dont we focus on clean energy and reopening factories and putting people back to work nobody is benefiting from jobs that are leaving the community
1432923 thats kind of a tricky question ive got colleagues in the senate who are doing absolutely outstanding work and theyre well into their 70s

1432925 who is nancy pelosi and why should i dislike her
1432926 the only result that pelosi achieved in visiting damascus and in sitting down with the syrian president and shaking his hand was to deliver a blow to the liberal opposition in syria and frustrate reformists hopes for change by breaking through the ring of isolation surrounding bashar assads regime syria advanced several steps towards repression and despotism and the march of reform and democracy fell behind
1432927 unlike pelosi we are believers in freedom of opinion and thought and speech
1432928 nancy pelosi holds the position of the u s speaker of the house of representatives she is the third in line to the u s presidency
1432929 who is nancy pelosi and why should i dislike her
1432930 i dont have the need and have apologized for my previous error you were quick to call me on
1432931 its an inconvenience but not such a huge deal as you might think
1432932 they somehow never got societys message and hopefully they never will
1432933 oh lets throw in an other category as a fail safe
1432934 its okay that youre crying nothings changed we can be comfortable with this situation
1432935 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1432936 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1432937 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1432938 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1432939 it is going to take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy energy independence will require all hands on deck from america

1432958 you just have to learn from your mistakes thats what i did and thats how i looked at it i felt like i was there for a reason and i just had to learn from it

1433018 the world has abandoned a fortress mentality in the real world and we need to move beyond it in cyberspace america needs a network that can project power by building an af mil robot network botnet that can direct such massive amounts of traffic to target computers that they can no longer communicate and become no more useful to our adversaries than hunks of metal and plastic america needs the ability to carpet bomb in cyberspace to create the deterrent we lack

1433023 first of all nascar from an officiating point of view did a great job you look at what happens in an average race when youve got a wreck or an inclement situation youve got pending rain and the prospect of having rain stop and start theyve got a lot of experience with that they know how to predict whats going to happen nobody in the tower there that im aware of had any experience from nascars side dealing with a rain event like that they made really great judgments they worked through it it would have been nice if they could have run the full measure of laps but they got through it and called a great race it was great that ron fellows won for the canadian interest that was there so it was not an unhappy result even though we would have liked to have seen a ford product prevail
1433024 it turned out to be a great tire that was extraordinarily durable it went through the dry period without getting hurt and still had enough edge on it and enough groove in it that when the track got wetter again they still worked pretty good it was possible to run the number of laps that were run on one set of rain tires and that was my biggest surprise i figured as much effort that was being made to dry the track before they put the rain tires on that the rain tires would last just a few laps and everybody would be in to put on either a second set of rain tires or dries as it turned out the tire was right for the circumstance and nascar made great decisions and the result was good
1433025 the thing that was clear is that the drivers for the most part were lacking in confidence of how to deal with the rain there were a lot of missteps just based on a lack of respect for the rain and the conditions that went with it there were a number of cars that got caught up in things jacques villeneuve for one got caught up in a wreck under caution which surprised me joey logano got caught up in a wreck under caution it didnt surprise me with joey because hes so young and inexperienced generally it surprised me on jacques that he let himself get caught up in that but the thing that was most glaring that puts me to work this week is something like scott pruetts car it was a disaster because it steamed up on the inside if your car steams up on the inside you cant see out some people had windshield wipers and some people didnt there were various strategies on that i think a wiper generally is a good thing it was a surprise to me that carls car didnt have a wiper on it but if you had a wiper as a for instance like marcos ambrose had that at 50 miles an hour the wiper didnt touch the windshield anymore thats also not right the idea of configuring the car so that it performs as it needs to and the systems work adequately in the wet condition is something that requires attention that the teams dont have experience with im saying my teams dont have it either and without having a baseline of having to run a race that says heres a system that works weve used this system forever without having that baseline in systems theres great jeopardy of having a car that will let a driver down on a day when he could do his business otherwise
1433026 we have the task of rejuvenating our sportscar driver line up
1433027 we have already successfully integrated lucas luhr alexandre pr mat and mike rockenfeller in the sportscar project we now continue this route with marcel f ssler
1433028 its a great honour for me that i can drive the r10 tdi for audi the car is very impressive what most impressed me during the tests was just how quiet the engine is from inside the cockpit because of this you dont feel the true sensation of speed i immediately realised the hi tech level of this car
1433029 i was never in america and therefore also contest my first race on american soil anyway ill be bombarded with a huge amount of new impressions the circuits and the people in the team are all new to me ill also have to familiarise myself with the procedures in the american le mans series im not putting myself under pressure but of course id like to make as good an impression as possible and be quick
1433030 there are no speed limits on the road to excellence
1433031 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1433032 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1433033 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1433034 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1433035 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1433036 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1433037 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1433038 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1433039 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1433040 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1433041 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1433042 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1433043 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1433044 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1433045 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1433046 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1433047 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1433048 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked

1433245 i have no hard feelings and i mean that truly
1433246 i think he still has the ability to help a ballclub
1433247 i benefited quite a bit from him thinking that a relievers value was something that could be quantified through a statistic
1433248 a save is what it is you save the game its a situation in which the tying run is at the plate or on deck and the game is on the line
1433249 its the same reason more football coaches dont go for it on fourth and 1
1433250 the position has become very media driven it became a national story when boston announced it would go with a bullpen by committee
1433251 whitey herzog had a lot of success with a closer by committee
1433252 although now that i think back on it im not sure they called it closer by committee back then
1433253 you changed the game you created the ninth inning pitcher
1433254 was the managers who did it not me instead of bringing in their best reliever when the game was on the line in the seventh or eighth inning which had been the practice in the past they saved him for the ninth
1433255 having lived both sides of it a closer doesnt seems so important until you dont have one
1433256 i know that sounds contradictory but a lot of emotions are tied in with the game if theres a three run lead in the ninth and the stats show that you win 97 percent of those games and youre upgrading to only 98 percent with your closer well that 1 percent increase is worth it because losing is so painful in that situation
1433257 why did you use your closer with a three run lead in the ninth when studies show you would have probably won anyway why not save him for a more important situation such as a tie in the seventh
1433258 good enough for whitey herzog its good enough for us

1433339 our recent surveys show apple and rim on a clear collision course in the consumer smart phone market as the three new rim phones get set to counterattack the market assault from the apple 3g iphone
1433340 and while the current survey shows the new rim releases have considerable potential the real test is how satisfied consumers will be with their new blackberries once they hit the market
1433341 who could find themselves increasingly pushed to the sidelines as the two goliaths battle for market dominance
1433342 apple customers on the other hand appear least likely to buy any of the new rim phones
1433343 as the old adage goes to the victor goes the spoils and by the looks of things apple and rim are both victors the apple iphone has captured the hearts and minds of its user base and so has the rim blackberry fortunately for both the global consumer and enterprise smart phone markets are big enough to support both apple and the other cell phone manufacturers that look like the real losers
1433344 moving entertainment content around the home requires a robust networking technology with end to end quality of service ensuring that a movie or program will play without interruption
1433345 by combining the cwave mac phy performance with the digital rights protection inherent in 1394 and designing it to coexist with all of the services already using the coax wiring in todays homes we have created the ideal solution for networking high definition entertainment devices
1433346 methods and apparatuses for data driven global boundary optimization are described herein
1433347 light guide panels are utilized in keyboard assemblies to backlight the keypads of the keyboard
1433348 when led 16 is activated a fiber mat 18 is illuminated to provide backlighting for the keyboard
1433349 in addition to the inefficient lighting issues associated with conventional light guide panels there is also a problem with the size of the panel when utilizing such a panel
1433350 accordingly what is needed is a light guide panel that has increased illumination over conventional light guide panels when in use but does not add to or increase the size of the keyboard the system must be easy to use compatible with existing devices and cost effective the present invention addresses such a need
1433351 another common technique for providing backlighting is to use a light guide panel clear sheet of plastic with texture or printed ink to disperse the light as needed however in the existing light guide panels the sources for illumination are placed beyond the perimeter of the lighted area this increases the overall form factor of the light guide panel and is undesirable
1433352 required to remain on stand by for the entire night every night of the week for the entire week without compensation
1433353 embodiments of the present invention disclose a compensation method and circuit for a pulse modulation circuit especially for class d modulators to compensate for the reverse current of the power supply
1433354 one embodiment of the present invention thus comprises a modeling of the reverse current from the modulator and then designing a compensation circuit having essentially the same voltage dependent characteristics but with a reverse polarity as the reverse current
1433355 the similarity of the voltage dependent characteristics of the compensation current can cover the whole range of operating voltages for optimum efficiency and preferably match only the shape and the amplitude for a pre determined range of operating voltages for ease of circuit design
1433356 in another embodiment the present invention also discloses a universal compensation circuit suitable for many modulator circuits with designable components
1433357 in a preferred embodiment the compensation circuit comprises an amplifier preferably a linear amplifier such as an operational amplifier to provide the gradually sloped current together with a clamping circuit to clamp the transitional current at a maximum value and a zero value
1433358 embodiments of the present invention further disclose a class d amplifier comprising a compensation circuit to compensate for the reverse current
1433359 embodiments of the present invention can also be used in conjunction with other compensation circuits such as energy storage dc loading differential drive or push pull voltage source

1433366 i cannot believe government would go ahead and make these kinds of changes which allow women of all ages to purchase plan b without consulting with the people who know the most about it

1433368 recent statistics show that almost 95 of spanish babies diagnosed with downs syndrome are aborted
1433369 have been reduced by half due to prenatal diagnosis and selective abortions
1433370 in canada where there are no legal restrictions on abortion it was revealed this year that 80 90 percent of mothers whose children are diagnosed with down syndrome children decide to abort
1433371 theres certainly a social construct around the existence of disability that says people with disabilities are less valuable than those without disabilities
1433372 the common view of cohabitation as a steppingstone to marriage needs to be seriously questioned
1433373 instead serial cohabitation may be an emerging norm as cohabiting unions form and break up
1433374 if marriage promotion programs hope to target poor cohabiting women our results seemingly suggest that the likelihood of success is not assured
1433375 commitment and stability are at the core of childrens needs yet in a great proportion of cohabitations these two requirements are absent

1433392 im still going for graduate positions companies may think i have too much experience for them to mould me into who they want
1433393 they may be more satisfied with their job choices because they have taken longer to make them and enjoyed a wider range of experiences

1433634 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1433635 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1433636 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1433637 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1433638 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1433639 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1433640 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1433641 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1433642 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people

1433655 we have not yet read the report which has not been sent to us by the rwandan government we are therefore not in a position to react
1433656 the overwhelming nature of frances support to the rwandan policy of massacres shows the complicity of french political and military officials in the preparation and execution of the genocide
1433657 they france clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee
1433658 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice

1433666 the main handler of these coups on the street side has been the albert einstein institution
1433667 peter ackerman a multimillionaire banker had sponsored regime changes in serbia ukraine and georgia through the albert einstein institute
1433668 is a u s government run operation designed to link gandhian methods of nonviolent protest to pentagon and u s state department efforts to overthrow foreign governments
1433669 a central role in a new generation of warfare one which has incorporated the heroic examples of past nonviolent resistance into a strategy of obfuscation and misdirection that does the work of empire

1433678 they are the ideologues of the soft coup and it seems like theyre here in venezuela they are laying out the slow fuse theyll continue laying it out with marches events trying to create an explosion
1433679 for those persons who are familiar with my life and work and that of the albert einstein institution these inaccuracies unless corrected will cast doubts on your credibility
1433680 none of the institutes critics has been able to provide evidence of a single violation of this allegedly apolitical transpartisan consultation policy
1433681 the einstein institution is committed to democracy and freedom the right of peoples to live liberation from oppression and to exploring and developing the viability of nonviolent struggle against military attacks and other types of political violence
1433682 it is not the institutions role to consult on how to defeat a nonviolent struggle movement which is resisting dictatorship genocide oppression or aggressive war consultation with both sides in a given conflict is more likely and desirable when the distribution of rights and wrongs between the two contending groups is mixed
1433683 the simple truth is that aei members present their research to organizations that ask them to finances permitting if the state department asked them to make a presentation i believe they would be happy to
1433684 the attendees included representatives of venezuelas broad based but fragmented opposition who are struggling to regroup after failing to force chavez from office in an anti government strike in december and january
1433685 what motivates me is that there are real threats out there to rolling back venezuelas exciting and ambitious socialist initiatives and we need to focus on countering them not being sidetracked by paranoid fantasies against phantom enemies
1433686 all peace activists want peace but do activists want peace at any cost
1433687 we operate on what we regard as a deeper level
1433688 strategic nonviolent struggle is all about political power how to seize political power and how to deny it to others
1433689 nonviolent strategy is no different from armed conflict except that very different weapons systems are employed
1433690 no government that had the support of the majority of its people has ever been overthrown through a nonviolent civil resistance movement
1433691 experience has shown that nonviolent struggle is an effective means of waging conflict

1433732 i dont think hes the antichrist but there is a spirit of antichrist at work in the west in a very strong and open way that is leading people to want to solve their problems and have a desire to have their lives improved without christ thats what the spirit of antichrist does it denies christ

1433735 you only need people in your life that want you in theirs
1433736 i think its crystal clear the dyes affect kids behavior
1433737 the tougher questions are how many kids and to what extent is their behavior affected but time is long overdue to get rid of these dyes from the food supply let scientists study them in a laboratory
1433738 i would say no the jury is not still out
1433739 i think the vast preponderance of scientific evidence shows that these products are safe we have seen nothing conclusive that has any link whatsoever between hyperactivity and food colors as approved food colors
1433740 we started not eating popcorn at the movie theater and he stopped having problems after the movies
1433741 and then a few weeks after he had five skittles and he hit the roof
1433742 and thats when we were sure it was the dyes and not the sugar and since weve cut them out its been an amazing difference
1433743 theyre unnecessary they have no health benefits to the consumers whatsoever they only pose a risk and that risk is intolerable
1433744 if consumers are concerned all of the colors are listed on the labels
1433745 so they can simply go to the label and look for colors and if they choose not to buy those colors there are alternatives that dont have those colors in them

1433761 we preach christ crucified to the jews a stumbling block and to gentiles foolishness but to those who are called both jews and gentiles christ the power of god and the wisdom of god because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brethren that not many wise according to the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty

1433777 every time you fill your tank the oil companies fill their pockets now big oils filling john mccains campaign with 2 million in contributions because instead of taxing their windfall profits to help drivers mccain wants to give them another 4 billion in tax breaks after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1433778 they provided the spark but we were the energy that was already out there
1433779 we need to drill here and we need to drill now
1433780 instead of offering a real plan to lower gas prices the only energy plan that hes really promoting is more drilling
1433781 thats what he talked about yesterday i want to drill here i want to drill now i dont know where he was standing i think he was in a building somewhere
1433782 this plan will not lower prices today it wont lower prices during the next administration
1433783 the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least seven years
1433784 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to off shore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1433785 it underscores that barack obama isnt being straightforward with voters and has the bad judgment americans cant afford right now
1433786 i know that theres going to be all kinds of discussion
1433787 john mccain wants to talk about paris hilton and britney spears thats his idea of a really relevant campaign but i dont have time to deal with that mess
1433788 we can watch helplessly as the price of gas rises and falls because of some foreign crisis weve got no control over
1433789 and uncover every single barrel of oil buried beneath john mccains feet only to realize we dont have enough for a few years much less for a century
1433790 while americans are hurting barack obama is opposed to off shore drilling and is also opposed to admitting that he voted for the same corporate giveaways for big oil that hes campaigning against today
1433791 it underscores that barack obama isnt being straightforward with voters and has the bad judgment americans cant afford right now
1433792 in stumping tuesday in this key battleground state obama sought to link the troubled economy with republican policies and offer his own energy plan in contrast he has tried to cast mccain as more concerned about oil company profits and drilling than an overall energy strategy however obama himself voted for a 2005 energy bill backed by bush that included billions in subsidies for oil and natural gas production a measure cheney played a major role in developing mccain opposed the bill on grounds it included billions in unnecessary tax breaks for the oil industry
1433793 change your mind on issues on a daily basis is what we can believe in
1433794 the democrats appear to have blunted any momentum sen mccain gained from last weeks ad associating sen obama with britney spears and paris hilton
1433795 once again we are seeing that obama has a small but durable edge over mccain it is up to mccain to find a way to change the fundamental dynamics of this campaign
1433796 never doubt that a small group of thoughtful committed citizens can change the world indeed it is the only thing that ever has

1433807 no one should think twice order from the marillion online shop racket records at marillion com ive placed several orders catching up over the last year and every order was carefully packaged and delivered very quickly im in canada and ive been getting my orders from racket faster than canadian online retailers dont know how you do it

1433812 well everybody knows that i mean thats what i heard in the media
1433813 is not of the kind of leadership youd want to have
1433814 and frankly being a committee chairman is not leading a great organization or making great things happen and for that matter you know whats happened in washington in the last 25 years have you seen the kinds of results that america wanted did they get the job done unfortunately not so if he has been a leader where has it led us look at his legislation mccain feingold that hurt our first amendment rights mccain kennedy that was granting amnesty to 10 million illegal aliens and then now mccain lieberman that wants to put a huge tax effectively on american gasoline buyers and rate payers his record is not of the kind of leadership youd want to have
1433815 the memo stresses that dia shall not be designated as a law enforcement activity and shall not perform any law enforcement functions previously assigned to dod cifa
1433816 this seems like an attempt to differentiate and distance the new organization from the controversies that dogged the old one
1433817 the realignment of cifas functions and resources into dia strengthens the close historical and operational relationship between counterintelligence and humint
1433818 integration under one organization will result in greater collaboration in operational and support areas where both disciplines overlap
1433819 wont simply be defending against foreign spies i e defensive counterintelligence they will be actively attempting to infiltrate derail and defeat foreign intelligence operations
1433820 thats a tricky dangerous line of work but also potentially an enormously productive one

1433823 i believe shes become a terrible embarrassment to them but shes not a terrorist
1433824 when the truth comes out people will see she did nothing wrong
1433825 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1433826 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1433827 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1433828 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1433829 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1433830 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1433831 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1433832 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1433833 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1433834 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1433835 nothing feels better than finding your own way of expression and seeing it into creation the way your mind sees it
1433836 no secret deal or accommodation kept us out of the city
1433837 as 90 percent of the attacks were against us we thought if we moved out we would remove the source of the problem
1433838 but actually the jaish al mahdi the mahdi army had been fighting us because we were the only obstacle to their total control
1433839 there was no structure in place in the city for units to go back in and start mentoring the iraqi troops
1433840 when the action was launched british forces provided a raft of military support including armor artillery airpower medical and logistic support
1433841 what happened in basra nasiriyah amarah and other areas falls on the shoulders of the british forces
1433842 basra is considered the economic capital of iraq but the british let the militias do what they wanted
1433843 security in afghanistan has deteriorated and our enemies are on the offensive
1433844 the taliban are now mounting a hit and run war against their enemies
1433845 it doesnt need much money or weapons compared to what the foreign troops are spending
1433846 the goal of terrorism is to terrify and to intimidate
1433847 it is not to take and hold territory it is not to dominate institutions it is not to win the allegiance of the populace it is to terrify and the tactics of the taliban are more terroristic even than at the end of the last fighting season
1433848 the increasing use of very public attacks has had a striking effect on morale far beyond the immediate victims
1433849 now they are on the brink of humiliation thats the aim of our fight
1433850 im so happy im on the phone with you mama oh wait edwards calling
1433851 we registered for a lot just because we wanted people to have options
1433852 showing people what you like thats what it was about for me
1433853 i didnt want anyone to spend 100 on something id never use
1433854 make sure you register for stuff youre actually going to use because you may end up with something and say what am i supposed to do with this
1433855 we registered for a whole bathroom set and we actually ended up having to take it back because when we got it home we realized we have a pedestal sink and nowhere to put all of it
1433856 with me i was more about the style i wanted everything to be natural colors
1433857 being a tall guy im 6 foot 3 i like the full body towels and not the little square foot towels
1433858 if i was going to register again i would register for things like a nice electric razor or a new electric toothbrush more gadgety type things
1433859 im big into movies so i wanted a combination vhs dvd player so i wouldnt have to get a separate vcr and a dvd someday
1433860 i like to cook and i play a lot with different knives so one of the things we registered for was a set of santoku knives
1433861 neither of us had lived on our own before so we started with the basics
1433862 being a guy i dont really think about all the practical kitchen stuff like measuring cups and skewers
1433863 i wanted all the really expensive stainless steel pots and pans and the george foreman grill
1433864 the only thing i was picky about was a new pizza cutter because i didnt want it to be too big
1433865 i just liked the look of this wine carafe and decanter set and we dont even drink but that was the only thing we got two of
1433866 i was just hoping to open up one xbox game
1433867 try on things that you would never think youd want you might surprise yourself
1433868 educate yourself on what you like and what styles are out there
1433869 any dress will look good if it has proper fit and emphasizes the good parts and de emphasizes the bad parts
1433870 when you go to different shops you see the same types of gowns
1433871 local stores tend to be cheaper because they have lower overhead costs
1433872 so many companies use antiquated systems not only does this reduce the efficiency of information flow but staff have to work much harder sometimes across several parallel systems to achieve a result that could be automated by a flexible dynamic system
1433873 we expect saas revenues to grow to 56 5b in 2015 nearly 70 of the overall market in just 8 years time
1433874 you can have fashion and comfort in the same shoe
1433875 brides dont want to wear clogs but there are shoes that will fit the bill
1433876 she told me to wear the shoes 15 minutes a day for seven days with socks on
1433877 brides are having more fun with it because you can be the traditional bride but when you lift the dress you see your flair
1433878 we served over 30 fresh fruit pies handmade by ashley baron rodriguez instead of cake
1433879 it was very hard at first and i was very nervous and quiet but it is just talking to your partner
1433880 you are pretty much just saying it to your husband to be
1433881 every element in your wedding is a chance to be creative
1433882 it reminded me of all the marriages i have to look up to
1433883 a lot of brides come with the idea of a big dress and big cake
1433884 nowadays weddings should represent who you are and what you love there are no wedding cops to come tell you youre wrong
1433885 weve all been to countless weddings and we cant all remember the little details
1433886 putting in unique aspects makes it memorable and more special to your spouse and family
1433887 keep it fun it should be a bonding time youre sharing with your daughter
1433888 it doesnt have to be expensive it just has to reflect you and your tastes
1433889 it went with my classy event feel and i wanted my guests to be pampered
1433890 i thought a three course meal was a good way to pamper them
1433891 and there are always little things we can do to cut costs
1433892 younger couples dominated the registries 15 years ago but now some couples are registering for a second time
1433893 theyre more savvy about their needs theyve developed their own taste
1433894 theyre registering for the best skillet on the market because they already have 12 pots and pans
1433895 the envelope is the very first thing your guests will see
1433896 if you do it yourself make sure you have more than one person proofread the invitation
1433897 i really like the idea of calla lilies i thought they were really elegant
1433898 ryan and i really wanted it to be a day that was sincere and meaningful
1433899 its like one of the biggest days of their lives too
1433900 estimates put the national average at about 46 percent where one or both partners have been married previously and ive even seen estimates as high as 50 percent
1433901 i spent a lot of time really thinking about the elements that were critical to me
1433902 kids and dogs were not just welcome at our wedding they were encouraged
1433903 second time couples realize right off the bat that with the same budget they can treat themselves and their guests to a more meaningful and memorable event by keeping their guest list smaller
1433904 i hired a local florist to come the day before the wedding to help us make our own flowers
1433905 the trend particularly for second time weddings oftentimes opposed to what has traditionally been the case is for the groom to have very specific opinions on the style comfort and design of wedding elements
1433906 men of all backgrounds are comfortable with manicures pedicures even facials in preparation for the big day
1433907 financial institutions provide accounts specifically designated for a house down payment
1433908 for the socially conscious a gift registry can be set up for money to be donated to a food bank or charity
1433909 folks who wanted to gift us did and those who didnt didnt feel obligated we ended up with some fantastically creative and thoughtful expressions of love
1433910 you promised me lord that if i followed you you would walk with me always
1433911 in reality islam is a revolutionary ideology and programme which seeks to alter the social order of the whole world and rebuild it in conformity with its own tenets and ideals muslim is the title of that international revolutionary party organized by islam to carry into effect its revolutionary programme and jihad refers to that revolutionary struggle and utmost exertion which the islamic party brings into play to achieve this objective

1434041 the supreme court has to change this is the year of the democrats
1434042 these kinds of decisions undermine the jury system which is the very heart of our system of justice
1434043 the court must be thoughtful and deliberate not politically oriented a jury finding ought to be sacrosanct our supreme court should overturn jury verdicts only when dictated by the law and the evidence
1434044 while per curiam opinions serve a necessary purpose in our judicial system they should never be used to shield the court from criticism on controversial issues before it
1434045 the court must operate openly and be accountable to its citizens

1434094 at shows kids will approach me to my face and ask how ruck is doing i just respond with hes chillen
1434095 we didnt try and get cute with this album and pick some out da box beats and get on some philosophy sh t we did what we knew best and that was rhyme about the street while of course infusing the humor that you know youre going to get when you listen to our rhymes
1434096 itll only affect ross if ross allows it to affect him

1434102 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
1434103 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
1434104 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
1434105 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
1434106 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
1434107 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
1434108 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
1434109 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
1434110 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
1434111 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
1434112 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
1434113 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
1434114 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
1434115 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
1434116 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
1434117 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1434118 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
1434119 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
1434120 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
1434121 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
1434122 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
1434123 yo se lo que me conviene y lo que no
1434124 no sab s lo que hizo lucio en la fiesta del s bado
1434125 por qu no te dedic s a tu novia y me dej s en paz
1434126 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
1434127 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
1434128 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
1434129 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
1434130 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
1434131 as the largest youth development organization in america 4 h has the ability to help shape and mold the future leaders of america
1434132 4 h continues to positively impact our nations future by providing quality hands on science programs to kids that potentially spark a life long interest in fields of science and engineering i congratulate all the 4 h members and staff on the launch of their new initiative which will lay the ground work for america to continue to be competitive economically and technologically in the future
1434133 4 h is a solution to americas need for future leaders in science engineering and technology
1434134 over the last century 4 h has had a positive impact on tens of millions of young people many of whom are involved in scientific careers today our university based curriculum not only engages youth at an early age and stimulates curiosity about the sciences but also helps unleash the power of youth to pursue successful careers and positions of leadership in these fields
1434135 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
1434136 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
1434137 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
1434138 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
1434139 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
1434140 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
1434141 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
1434142 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
1434143 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
1434144 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
1434145 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
1434146 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
1434147 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
1434148 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
1434149 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
1434150 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
1434151 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
1434152 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
1434153 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
1434154 who are open to doing something on the production side
1434155 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
1434156 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
1434157 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
1434158 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
1434159 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
1434160 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
1434161 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
1434162 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
1434163 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
1434164 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
1434165 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
1434166 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
1434167 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
1434168 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
1434169 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
1434170 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
1434171 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
1434172 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
1434173 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
1434174 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
1434175 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
1434176 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
1434177 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
1434178 bertelsmann aims to continuously increase enterprise value by improving profitability while maintaining a return on sales of around 10 wherever possible it strives to ensure 100 ownership of its business operations
1434179 this makes sense for bertelsmann because its part of their strategy to refocus the business portfolio
1434180 and my opponents giving out these pressure gauges well i hate to be the one to tell people this but theres no one single answer to this issue and the government cant solve all your problems if you elect me the government will do its part but the other side of this is that you have to take some personal responsibility for helping you need to tune your cars and check your tire pressure so lets tell john mccain what to do with these gauges he obviously doesnt know
1434181 wah im depressed why does this always happen to me wah
1434182 this farm bill covers a broad swath of america from farming to hunger to conservation to measures involving good tax policy
1434183 while it is not a perfect bill overall this is a very good piece of legislation we made important reforms in the nutrition title by providing better benefits to people in this country who would otherwise go hungry we also provided the right kind of tax incentives by reforming the endangered species act in a positive way i look forward to working with the u s department of agriculture as we move into the implementation process this year
1434184 there have now been several pieces of legislation introduced to address speculation in the energy markets and there have been several hearings held in many different senate committees on the topic
1434185 i have heard several senators speak on the senate floor about this matter and based upon the facts i have seen it is very irrational to blame the acting chairman of the cftc for 4 00 gasoline we should not rush to legislate an uninformed solution particularly when we might create more problems by driving speculators into markets for which the cftc receives no trading data and has no ability to monitor
1434186 if we are to fault market speculators for current gas prices we cannot blame it on their increased market participation when we compare their level of participation to that of commercial participants
1434187 rather we need to allow the cftc to implement those initiatives they have just recently announced and complete their on going investigation with this critical information we can then make a real assessment of any role speculators are playing
1434188 the example most often used by several of my colleagues is the trading of the west texas intermediate crude contract on the london based exchange ice futures europe
1434189 the cftc through no action relief allows ice to offer this contract to u s traders however in exchange ice futures europe has agreed to notify the cftc when traders exceed position accountability levels established by u s exchanges for the wti crude oil contract additionally the united kingdoms regulatory authority the financial services authority has been supplying the cftc with requested surveillance data for several years
1434190 while i am supportive of ensuring doctors receive adequate medicare reimbursements so they can cover costs i cannot support senator baucus legislation which will expand entitlement programs and ultimately take money away from reimbursing doctors as we move on down the road
1434191 while we need a more permanent solution so doctors dont have to worry about having to lay off employees or denying medicare patients altogether it is important that we work in a bipartisan manner to reach a temporary solution for doctors reimbursements in the meantime doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending it is my hope that congress will work toward a bipartisan agreement that will provide doctors with the relief they need before july 1
1434192 during sports events it glows with energy the hue of its translucent skin shifts from game to game with the colors of the teams inside the steep pitch of the seats creates the impression that the 70 000 spectators are coiled tightly around the field its a masterly way to choreograph the focused hysteria of a soccer match but in beijing the architects were clearly striving for something more heroic the centerpiece of a vast olympic park in the northern reaches of beijing the stadium is raised on a mound of earth to give it a more monumental presence its matrix of crisscrossing columns and beams was conceived as a gargantuan work of public sculpture viewed from a distance the contrast between its bent steel columns and its bulging elliptical form gives the stadium a surreal moody appearance as if it were straining to contain the forces that are pushing and pulling it this way and that philosophically it suggests the tensions just beneath the surface of a society in constant turmoil
1434193 waterbuoy is a unique product it will lift up to 1kilogram back to the surface it will stay afloat for at least 24 hours and it has an emergency flashing light that makes it visible from up to 250 meters away in the dark so you can even get your valuables back at night

1434208 acupuncture plus routine care in patients with headache was associated with marked clinical improvements compared with routine care alone
1434209 for patients diagnosed with an anxiety or depressive disorder studies have suggested that prescribed exercise may alleviate symptoms but that effect may be more environmentally driven
1434210 these findings do not detract from the beneficial effects of regular exercise on numerous aspects of physical health such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus

1434214 lets face it many other countries would love to have growth in the high single digits yes stock markets have fallen so growth may slow down a bit because if people dont have confidence they stand back but india and china are economic powerhouses and that is not changing
1434215 what is happening in the developed world you may say it needed to happen a slowdown was necessary because poor quality of credit had spread through the market in asia and india the quality of credit is better asia is far more conservative in giving and taking credit we see in india even more conservatism creeping in in consumer finance for instance we see the quality of credit in asia improving

1434246 attract grocery stores and restaurants to the area by preserving existing land for these uses

1434250 it is a show of confidence by fifa on south african officials because the world body normally appoints the top officials for the opening match as this is usually the game that sets the tone for the rest of the tournament

1434252 the various panels were finalised based on the performance of each individual last season and were therefore rated accordingly we took into consideration also passes and failures in the fitness tests up to the one we held last week
1434253 the elite panel is recognition of the achievements and status of those in it but to be there you must have worked for it so each referee must perform consistently well and at a high standard it is also this panel that feeds fifa call ups and the premier league
1434254 those who are in the fifa panel are assessed and approved by the world body itself
1434255 this is unacceptable we have had 13 referees who failed the tests with three of them from the premier league panel
1434256 its very difficult for us now with all the problems we have had
1434257 we have had all sorts of problems including accreditation and so on and we now have two players who may not play in our game on thursday
1434258 when you dont have all your players available the team just kind of picks itself
1434259 there is no pain when he walks but we will have to take him in for a scan later and see what happens hopefully he should be fine but if he cannot play that means we have only 14 players available
1434260 we have worked hard and prepared hard and these boys know what is expected of them so we will just have to go out there and do this country proud

1434416 from the time of the abduction to today special agents from the fbi as well as boston police detectives have worked around the clock trying to figure out who rockefeller is

1434418 he was very close to his daughter he loved her dearly he was arrested outside the residence and has not seen her since the arrest
1434419 we cannot even verify that he is a united states citizen we cannot find even basic documentation of that fact he has simply no ties to anywhere the only ties that he has are to sandra boss and reigh there is no record of any clark rockefeller before 1993 and he has not provided any information for us to document who he is

1434426 they are arresting zimbabweans and taking away their goods for very petty reasons such as being drunk even when you are not driving
1434427 i sipped a bottle of an alcoholic beverage as we were crossing the mozambican border into zimbabwe and we were stopped and told that it was a serious crime to drink beer in front of a police officer
1434428 despite the fact that i was a passenger everyone was ordered out of the vehicle and told we were not going to proceed we could not do anything because the officer was armed with a pistol so we had to part with crates of beer we had bought from mozambique
1434429 when they found no diamonds on me they took away all the money i had in mozambican currency which ran into thousands

1434520 the quasar itself is no longer visible to us but its light continues to travel through space and the voorwerp is a massive light echo produced as this light strikes the gas
1434521 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
1434522 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise
1434523 trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
1434524 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have done before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
1434525 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
1434526 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small telescope
1434527 the nearest active quasar called 3c 273 is 1 7 billion light years further away
1434528 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
1434529 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery
1434530 when we got the news about hannys voorwerp we were intrigued to find out what it was and fortunately we were able to slew the telescopes round and get some great images and spectra to study it
1434531 it was only later that we heard the story about how it had been discovered its inspirational that hanny picked out this object from galaxy zoo in her spare time and nobody had ever seen anything like it before

1434540 if you think about how an operating system is loaded its loaded onto a hard disk physically located on that machine the operating system is tied very tightly to that hardware
1434541 people take their application the operating system they want to run it against package it up along with policy and security they want and use that as a virtual client
1434542 the value of microsoft windows of what that product is today will diminish as more applications move to the web and microsoft needs to edge out in front of that i would be surprised if there was definitive evidence that nothing like this was not kicking around
1434543 eighty percent of windows sales are made when a new pc is sold thats a huge amount of money for them that they do not have to go out and get if windows ends up being less important over time as applications become more os agnostic where will microsoft make its money

1434640 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1434641 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters

1434643 i was trying to make up for the mistakes our team made earlier in the race
1434644 im pissed off its my job as a leader on this team to get these guys up and get them ready for this race and obviously i let them down its unacceptable this is crap
1434645 the problem with that was pool costs started to go up travel started to get expensive and the government funding went down you put all those things together and you couldnt attract the top coaches in the 70s and 80s we had some of the best coaches in the world and what happened was they left or retired and we couldnt replace them

1434649 megan meiers death was a terrible tragedy and there is an understandable desire to hold the defendant somehow accountable for it if defendants conduct was as alleged
1434650 but a dangerously overbroad construction of the cfaa would criminalize the everyday conduct of millions of internet users the novel indeed unprecedented in the history of the cfaa interpretation of advanced in the indictment cannot be squared with the plain language of the statute its legislative history and the constitutional requirements that criminal statutes provide citizens fair notice avoid vagueness and comport with the first amendment consequently amici urge the court to dismiss the indictment
1434651 serious encroachment on fundamental civil liberties including freedom of speech the first amendment assures the right to speak anonymously online
1434652 carefully identifying speech that falls outside of first amendment protection neither of those statutes appears to criminalize the
1434653 is when does access to a highly popular everyday website is without authorization or in excess of authorized access
1434654 the plain language of the cfaa does not criminalize an account holders use of a computer in violation of terms of service or tos but a trespassers access to computer systems or areas of computer networks without permission in other words the statute prohibits trespass and theft not improper motive or use
1434655 is a consensus bill aimed at deterring and punishing certain high tech crimes
1434656 legislative history confirms that congress intended the cfaa to criminalize intruders who trespassed on computers and computer networks and does not cover improper motive or use
1434657 run the risk that her continued use of the site could lead to criminal sanctions
1434658 the way she used her account if the allegations are true was reprehensible
1434659 but unless her hateful speech rises to the level of harassment or stalking it is not criminal and cannot be punished attempting instead to punish that speech under the cfaa merely because it took place on the internet in contravention to a private terms of service is improper

1434663 that bass would go in the rock and roll hall of fame some day if we could find it
1434664 thats like being a kid in a candy store ben i mean the rolling stones the beatles led zeppelin the who just a couple come to mind
1434665 a little known fact ben is that i was actually born in blackheath london england but i lost the accent at about two months old
1434666 tonight i think is going to be fantastic were getting down to serious competition now i think were where we need to be
1434667 well its not as much about taking risks ben its about leaving it on the stage i want to see the contestants the competitors i want to see them compete i want to make it like its the last song theyll ever play
1434668 i think its all well and good to be an artist on this show and not wanting to be a contestant and a beauty pageant singer but the fact is you have to want to win so if youre going to sing a mccartney song id say choose a paul mccartney song not from his lesser know brother vladimir
1434669 his voice is a very honest sounding voice i think hes very much aware of his sound and what he can do with his song which is very important
1434670 mark i talked earlier in the show about singing it like it was the last song and i feel vocally it was really strong you sang every note really well i just dont think its a winning performance
1434671 while i somewhat agree mark with what was said but the other thing i would have to say is that you also look much more comfortable performing than you have in the past i thought you did a really good job
1434672 he knows his voice very well because he uses it very well and to take on a john lennon song thats a big thing and he did it in his own way and enjoyed himself
1434673 mitch ive got to say my main thing with you is every single week youre consistent you have a consistency and i really like that in a performer i gotta tell you
1434674 it certainly was your own interpretation probably the wrong one but your own interpretation i thought some of the long holds of notes some of those bends felt really odd to me it just didnt make a lot of sense but then i actually wear that outfit on a regular basis so what do i know
1434675 ill tell you what drew im going on record as saying that that was my favourite performance from you so far
1434676 ill tell you why up until now i thought you were singing sort of thin that was the richest most heartfelt round performance youve done so far
1434677 drew i think that by far in my mind the most impassioned performance ive ever heard from you
1434678 i think the more he does it the more hell enjoy it
1434679 hes a good looking kid hes got a great voice and it seems to me hes got what it takes
1434680 i was really concerned because i was getting really bored sitting and watching you play the piano not that it wasnt really good but its not really my kind of thing i didnt know if you really had it in you to win this competition but dude you just threw it down in a serious way
1434681 i just remember back in the top 100 i remember you coming out sitting behind the piano and singing and all of us going hey whoah and you know what im beginning to think that maybe you are going to win
1434682 i like mookie i think he was the first one or the only one that performed as well as sang and he actually looked at me when he sang
1434683 first of all definitely one of the coolest things weve ever seen on this stage and youre definitely one of the coolest guys
1434684 i thought that you started the song a little low but i know why because you had to get into the higher parts so it may not have cut as well but when you did kick into the higher part of that song man you blew the doors off youre really here to compete
1434685 mookie i do a lot of traveling and ive got to tell you straight up everywhere i go people are talking about you you are an absolute rock star theres no question about it people got to get behind you and make it happen straight up
1434686 amberly is a beautiful girl and she has a beautiful voice the pitch is spot on which is not as easy as people may think and she does it very naturally
1434687 amberly your voice has this natural kind of gliding soaring silky ability to just go through the clouds i dont know every time i watch im like i cant believe you sing that good every time
1434688 its a fantastic song choice its right in your wheelhouse of where your voice sits most comfortably and also its that jazzy styling that you even put into your folk stuff was in there the biggest thing that i notice is the growth curve that youve been on because early in the 22 you were a little embarrassed to be the loud and proud girl that you really need to be but tonight its sexy daddys little girl kind of looks grown up up there and it was fantastic
1434689 hes got an individual approach i dont think he copied eric clapton or tried to he liked the song and sang it
1434690 you got so much flavour youve got this hip hop vibe that really really works no matter what youre singing your sense of rhythm your body movement how natural you are youre a performer and your tone is so recognizable really enjoy what you do man
1434691 i talked about rhythm and theres really four of you to me that have amazing rhythm and to me youre the four best and thats theo amberly mookie and you and tonight man again its your delivery you could sing anything its your delivery you just grew man its happening
1434692 these kind of incidents are rare and we are working hard to find the person responsible
1434693 we hope these videos will support the healthy emotional development of military children and adolescents during potentially difficult times in their lives
1434694 we also hope these videos will decrease feelings of stigma and isolation in our military children while sensitizing the larger american community to military child and adolescent culture and support needs
1434695 our goal is to reduce the anxiety and fear surrounding a military deployment and let children know they are not alone in the struggles their families are facing
1434696 within just a couple of weeks of my departure my normally well behaved 4 year old son started having some acting out behavior and a little bit of regression kind of moving backward in his development
1434697 he was expressing that he wasnt comfortable with my absence
1434698 when i got back from my deployment a lot of other soldiers were deploying and i began to notice a lot of children who were presenting with complaints of headaches and stomachaches that i couldnt explain
1434699 as pediatricians we are not trained to look that closely at how emotional concerns and stress affect the physical health of our young patients
1434700 however we are hoping to address that lack of training through the videos weve developed and many other opportunities developing through the military child and center
1434701 as we start to frame the discussion more in terms of military family readiness and support it is becoming more popular
1434702 as we provide more support for our military families to prepare them for the potential stresses of deployment and separation then our warriors are going to be more able to focus on their mission
1434703 being a military child or adolescent is actually a very unique experience
1434704 we think belonging to a military family really is a special thing military children serve and sacrifice for their nation in a way that is very important and is different from the way we as military servicemembers serve and sacrifice
1434705 they advocate for educational issues for children making sure that military children are treated fairly when they transfer into new school districts and that their credits transfer and they dont have to retake the basic history course every time they move to a new place because they are military kids
1434706 we know children experience stress differently based on their developmental age
1434707 younger children may have significant attachment concerns when their parents deploy they need to attach to their parents feel comfortable and connected in order to grow up emotionally healthy
1434708 i am actually a really nice person a lot of times when i meet people for the first time i think they are taken back by how warm my energy actually is because they watch the shows and they just figure me to be this nasty angry negative person but what it was is that i had a lot of things coming at me i had girls to compete with and then i had guys in my house who were there for the wrong reasons you have to know i got that way because my buttons were pushed if im not on the battlefield fighting any battles im going to put my swords away so im good
1434709 who the hell could fall in love with flavor flav he went to kiss me and i was very hesitant i did not want that to happen at all but youve got to do what youve got to do i wouldnt have had sex with him but i would have probably made out with him we lived the good life out there thats why i cried at the end everyones like you didnt even like him im like im leaving a pretty mansion in california im not going to be pampered anymore thats why i was crying man

1434853 both are very smart intelligent quarterbacks very knowledgeable about the game both are serious competitors hate losing at all costs tall strong arms i dont know tom very well yet but they seem like theyre just great guys to be around every day
1434854 i think they are just two great quarterbacks i think they found a way to be successful it came with a lot of hard work and they paid a lot of the prices where a lot of guys would leave early and these guys stay and watch film and do the extra in my opinion they are where they are now because of the work that they do not necessarily because it was given to them
1434855 we have the officials here so we will have them officiate the different aspects of practice through july 31 as we try to tighten up our techniques in pass coverage offensive holding offensive line play alignments and stuff like that

1434857 one thing i know about the media a lot of times they have no idea what theyre talking about
1434858 im quite sure that if my release was contingent on that it wouldnt have just been heard in the bay area it would have been heard all over everybody wants to take a shot at the patriots so im quite sure the media would have taken a great opportunity from my understanding my release wasnt based on that my release was based on the fact the raiders no longer wanted me out there i think thats what it comes down to

1434862 mobileme was simply not up to apples standards it clearly needed more time and testing it was a mistake to launch mobileme at the same time as iphone 3g iphone 2 0 software and the app store we all had more than enough to do and mobileme could have been delayed without consequence
1434863 we are taking many steps to learn from this experience so that we can grow mobileme into a service that our customers will love
1434864 one step that i can share with you today is that the mobileme team will now report to eddy cue who will lead all of our internet services itunes the app store and starting today mobileme eddys new title will be vice president internet services and he will now report directly to me

1434875 would be able to know that you have a very high near intractable cholesterol problem
1434876 yes there is risk but the advantages you gain are worth it you will no longer be at risk of receiving the wrong medicine or dosage because the computer will tell the nurse that youre already taking some other drug that will interact with the newly prescribed drug
1434877 claudia knew that she could never pull off the old fashioned kind of running away
1434878 i have a thermos bottle with cream of tomato soup
1434879 and a lobster salad sandwich on thin slices of white bread i have celery carrot sticks and black olives and a little cardboard shaker of salt for the celery and two plums and a tiny basket of cherries and vanilla pudding with chocolate sprinkles and a spoon to eat it with
1434880 i think its nice that there are all different kinds of lunches and breakfasts and dinners and snacks i think eating is nice
1434881 the reigns of history back in the hands of man
1434882 i must considered my sins for all the killing that had been done
1434883 ichi hatsune that is the little girls full name and she is just my ordinary neighborhood child but so much for being normal now as you already know were also digital monster handlers like you all still our world being less restricted as yours though ichi has no partner she is still able to visit the digital world it was during one of the regular outing of our sanction we hope that ichi could maybe adopt a digimon from one of the streams preferably an older model one so that itll be easier to handle and less likely to have damaged but it was during that time that thing that thing got her
1434884 something should have happened the alarms the warnings some kind dimensional shift in space something but there was nothing nothing that fosaken monster just appeared out of no where and took her
1434885 something should have happen then we could have reacted but nothing did and ichi was taken
1434886 it was a mega level glitch and nd back then we didnt even reach the level of ultimate
1434887 nope actually it may be best to let it out now than to have it linger in your mind during your mission right regan
1434888 we searched high and low day and night for a week finding her
1434889 well when i was helping the digi sprite outside i saw the streets seemed to have calmed down now maybe we can ask around and maybe find out which direction the girl in question has flown
1434890 regan i think it may be best that we not run in to takumi and especially kaze while this guy is around otherwise things may get really ugly
1434891 uh huh ugly for you too right afraid that you scream at little kaze to get a stuff toy from toy town and he comes back with a scale one of one doll of you as metalryumon
1434892 still you know what i have a slight tinkering feeling that we may meet up real soon
1434893 gah civilization ive never thought the smell of metal and transferal data can be so refreshing
1434894 of course give a hello to all my glitch friends hiding about they are here just in hiding im sure theyll be surprise to me with a partner
1434895 right well i say we going find a pawn shop or something to trade our access luggage off our backs
1434896 but werent you the one who said those items maybe important
1434897 nah after experiencing the burden carrying them around i kinda wish we let some loose
1434898 well there is only one way of settling this argument i say
1434899 eh eh sorry we got kinda rapped up in what we were doing
1434900 i said i wanna go see my friends and we are going together
1434901 long time no see midori how has the world been treating
1434902 arr midori arggh nice to see again what has it already been a couple of decades already
1434903 sorry midori for the lost of manners being detached for so long has really set a toll on us
1434904 he he just so ya know i really suck at shooting
1434905 but then again with a weapon this strong who needs to aim
1434906 you said something about your blade striking true i dont suppose you think you are some kind of hero or maybe a bounty hunter
1434907 now now lets not be hasty the question now is you dealt the first blow what be the business you have with us or more precisely who hired you for the hit
1434908 haganemaru asked me to pass to these two v cards they may have took a full month and a half weaponizing them but it is the best he can come up with in such short notice
1434909 reliable as always the ace glitch blacksmith so nine down last two to go come on burning eyes at least youve meet midori here lets get on to business
1434910 since we already know who is thieve who have stolen the original circuits
1434911 no let that boy name takumi have them for now he is still considered an ally amongst the destineds after all he did contribute much to our cost
1434912 something is wrong i should have complete jurisdiction over the visual on the digital world
1434913 yep approximately three meters and still is so mind you she is playing around with some digimon
1434914 johan and the blonde girl sitting on a tree k eh e e
1434915 hand over the girl and i warn you i dont like to repeat myself
1434916 hmph call me crazy then cuz even i dont even know why im doing this hell i dont even know that little midgets name
1434917 ichi hatsune that is the little girls full name and she is just my ordinary neighborhood child but so much for being normal now
1434918 all we have seen is the start of a process
1434919 but the insurers are not returning to writing a lot of business anytime soon they still need everyone to buy on to what they want to do and be back in a position where they can be offering a product to the marketplace that will be accepted
1434920 other claimants now have a road map if they want to settle but i wouldnt put my faith in it unless we see wholesale settlements
1434921 the question still begs about how many insurance holders will strike similar deals and we wouldnt be surprised for holdouts and hopes for higher payouts on their part
1434922 to attract new businesses they have to get the ratings agencies to give the top ratings
1434923 this will take a number of months depending on how cooperative the insurance departments and ratings agencies are insurance departments will buy in as long as plans are rational but the agencies are big open questions the key issues are the insurers ability to get new businesses as well as the investors confidence in the marketplace
1434924 there is also possible overhang from their old claims even if they put businesses in other operating units
1434925 for too long the health care needs of working families in western new york have been overlooked by albany
1434926 joe is a strong leader who is committed to making access to comprehensive health care for families in our community a top priority
1434927 i know personally how important it is for working families to have health care when my mom got sick my family was fortunate that we had healthcare but there are too many families who arent as lucky
1434928 with the support of groups like the cwa i will work hard to help working families gain access to comprehensive low cost healthcare
1434929 no one will now see what we are doing here
1434930 look at all those americans are up there we can talk to them
1434931 the use of tv in campaigns is kind of like our dependency on foreign oil we know we have to get off it we know we need to find alternative energy sources but we keep on going back to the pump
1434932 fact is we need to develop a higher degree of comfort with allocating media dollars to the web
1434933 non si possono scaricare sulle spalle degli atleti le contraddizioni della politica
1434934 unification for the sake of unification is not the path we decided to go down
1434935 in the end what matters most is what consumers are looking for but having too many people on the design phase especially early on would have hurt the project you could have three different user interfaces and a couple of application layers that doesnt make sense
1434936 a lot has happened in the last 12 months to push us in this direction
1434937 from our perspective creating a platform in a mobile space is not like building for the pc with mobile you are fighting for every spare 500 kilobytes you can find we know because we are building handsets right now so instead of adding in compatibility for everything we think it is important to clarify for developers the best possible direction and make it open source so it is available to more people
1434938 to have some type of coalescence is necessary whether the application is a game or interacting with the cloud
1434939 we also work with microsoft and symbian and our interaction with other groups is helping with standardization in the industry
1434940 and trying to service five cemeteries and trying to dig new graves and other duties they have to do they just got backlogged and havent been able to get this down
1434941 i wanted to know why it wasnt done and where it is and where it has been for the past year
1434942 gonna make sure it doesnt happen again were investigating it right now and i apologize no reason for it its not the way we do business
1434943 its a song that weve been performing all summer long
1434944 itll be different because were doing it at an awards show in front of all the celebrities you grew up watching but at the same time were doing our thing

1434948 got the news today the doctor said i had to stay a little bit longer and ill be fine
1434949 weve been looking into scheduling when we can do that because weve been busy with touring but we would love to the success from the first one we did not expect that at all and the possibility of a second movie would be great
1434950 a lot of the disney people have talked about a sequel and ive heard rumors about scripts and stuff i would really like a love interest
1434951 the process of serious negotiations with the ioc and improving relations
1434952 mind sports by their nature cannot be part of the program
1434953 in the ancient olympic games the element of cultural and mental activity was present
1434954 in the olympic games until the second world war there were competitions that rewarded the mental efforts of people in the same manner they rewarded physical efforts
1434955 today the missing element of the intellectual competition can be re introduced by the involvement of chess and perhaps bridge
1434956 we think bridge is a sport it requires stamina brain power and concentration bridge is a sport just like baseball and football it requires training and strenuous exercise it is more than just a game
1434957 show to the world that these games require effort competence and determination just like any other sport
1434958 can bring joy happiness and spectacle to the participants and to the audience
1434959 la subasta primaria de cetes result con alzas marginales en virtud de un entorno inflacionario que anticipa un nuevo aumento en la tasa de fondeo
1434960 el alza en las tasas se dio por varios aspectos el alza de los pron sticos de inflaci n por parte del banco central en espera de la inflaci n de julio y la revisi n de los analistas en sus expectativas de los precios al consumidor en el sondeo mensual de banxico

1434979 how can you say were not offering hope when were offering people jesus
1434980 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1434981 if there is a subtle shift in the risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1434982 absolutely and funny enough thats what actor should be doing
1434983 an unusual ability to believe that there are objects in a room that really are not there all you have to do is just believe
1434984 experiences are as distinct from services as services are from goods
1434985 when choice is limited i want a generalist when selection is difficult a jack of all trades is just fine but whenever possible please bring me a brilliant specialist
1434986 it happens ever day my gosh thats what slaughterhouses do thats how we get bacon and pork chops
1434987 basically you cannot have something with a hoof walk on plastic and not poke a hole in the plastic and let water into it hogs have a tendency to root and that would not have been good either
1434988 they did not want to take a chance on losing a city due to a few hogs
1434989 we trucked them as far as 200 miles away to other hog farms so that they would be taken care of
1434990 higher sales are not the goal theyre actually a byproduct an offshoot of working in a right ethical manner
1434991 over the last 20 years most of the tools that we humans have invented havemade it easier for us to be information snackers
1434992 whether justified or not banks and other financial institutions arent usually the first businesses that many of us think of as representing a transparent authentic buisness model
1434993 i had to pay over 120 in overdraft fees that should have not been there from the start
1434994 we felt that in the offline world customers communicate with other customers about our products and services so why not allow them to do it in the online world
1434995 we wanted other customers to learn from each other the good and the bad of our products and services
1434996 there are a ton of community sites out there where users can post these reviews already
1434997 i think the companies are taking the position that its happening anyway so we might as well let it happen in a place where we can exert some control over it
1434998 having an open forum site is a company saying were really into listening to our customers
1434999 i think its better for the brand in the long run
1435000 thats just not something i would do with my time
1435001 i think the only reason id write a review is if i had something to complain about
1435002 they wouldnt want it and likely would never do anything about it anyway
1435003 companies have to be open to the criticism and they have to be authentic and they need to be ready to respond
1435004 they cant just do it because everyone else is doing it
1435005 it really is a matter of acknowledging that the dialogue is already happening and deciding on whether or not youre going to participate
1435006 you shouldnt be looking to protect the brand image at the cost of communicating with your customers
1435007 looks more like a online game board than a user friendly banking function
1435008 i was sick and tired of my old bank it was like pulling teeth to get information on my accounts since i have switched to b of a i no longer put off balancing my account

1435013 unification for the sake of unification is not the path we decided to go down
1435014 in the end what matters most is what consumers are looking for but having too many people on the design phase especially early on would have hurt the project you could have three different user interfaces and a couple of application layers that doesnt make sense
1435015 a lot has happened in the last 12 months to push us in this direction
1435016 from our perspective creating a platform in a mobile space is not like building for the pc with mobile you are fighting for every spare 500 kilobytes you can find we know because we are building handsets right now so instead of adding in compatibility for everything we think it is important to clarify for developers the best possible direction and make it open source so it is available to more people
1435017 to have some type of coalescence is necessary whether the application is a game or interacting with the cloud
1435018 we also work with microsoft and symbian and our interaction with other groups is helping with standardization in the industry
1435019 there was a minor wing tip collision as the planes taxied towards runway one
1435020 both planes have now been moved they will return to the stands and also be examined by the airlines
1435021 a handful of passengers from the lufthansa flight mainly business passengers have decided not to travel today the others will be booked on alternative flights
1435022 obviously if you are about to take a flight its not something you expect to happen so i imagine people are feeling a little bit shook up
1435023 our plane was sitting on the end of the runway with the parking brake on
1435024 it wasnt moving another aircraft came towards it and then collided with it touching it with the wing tip
1435025 basically we were taxing and then it felt as if the plane was skidding there was a big judder i looked out and the end of the wing had crumpled there was a dent in the other plane we were probably there for about an hour before we were taken off
1435026 it was a shock not a huge drama but definitely a shock unfortunately we were only away for a week now rather than being sat in the sun we are sat in the radisson hotel in manchester airport

1435030 he was walking this a m and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible
1435031 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1435032 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1435033 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1435034 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1435035 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1435036 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbours drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1435037 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1435038 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1435039 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1435040 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1435041 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1435042 at the end of the day well have to achieve agreement and it remains to be seen whether the government will find this an acceptable attractive alternative to what theyve already proposed
1435043 its been an unusual spirit of co operation but i think its going to deliver the goods for cleaner air
1435044 its not every day you get a letter from the chemical producers and the sierra club co signed
1435045 eu almejo saber todos seus segredos eu quero atravessar seu fogo acender meus olhos com seu sorriso
1435046 yes you should have seen your grandmother she was just as fair as you when she was dancing there in the grass just as you are doing now her hair was bleached by the sun her lips were wild strawberry red she was lovely like a lily her love was like ember
1435047 the spider is usually symbolic of an unkind and sneaky individual are you the spider building a web or are you being dragged into one a spiders web represents entanglement and the general complexities of life depending on the details of the dream it could also be symbolic of a smothering individual in your daily life
1435048 a symbol of wholeness due to its circular shape he called circular symbols mandalas and said that they had valuable meaning for the dreamer the spider and his web may be calling for an integration of the dreamers personality leading to greater self awareness and resulting in feelings of completeness therefore the spider and his web may be considered profound and spiritual dream symbols which call for greater self understanding and encourage us to derive meaning and satisfaction from the intricate framework and interplay of life
1435049 all that shimmers in this world is sure to fade away again

1435053 obama may think hes king canute but the good king ordered the tides to halt precisely to refute sycophantic aides who suggested that he had such power obama has no such modesty

1435057 ive been seeing someone so we cant do what weve been doing anymore
1435058 allez mourir monstres de la nuit vous mavez fait assez souffrir
1435059 the art of war is governed by five constant factors these are the moral law heaven earth the commander method and discipline the moral law causes the people to be in complete accord with their ruler so that they will follow him regardless of their lives undismayed by any danger heaven signifies night and day cold and heat times and seasons earth comprises distances great and small danger and security open ground and narrow passes the chances of life and death the commander stands for the virtuous of wisdom sincerity benevolence courage and strictness method and discipline are to be understood as the marshalling of the army in its proper subdivisions the graduations of rank among the officers the maintenance of roads by which supplies may reach the army and the control of military expenditure
1435060 by means of these seven considerations i can forecast victory or defeat which of the two sovereigns is imbued with the moral law which of the two generals has the most ability with whom lie the advantages of heaven and earth on which side is discipline most rigorously enforced which army is stronger on which side are officers and men more highly trained in which army is there the greater constancy both in reward and punishment
1435061 all warfare is based on deception hence when able to attack we must seem unable when using our forces we must seem inactive when we are near we must make the enemy believe we are far
1435062 there is no instance of a country having benefited from prolonged warfare
1435063 in war then let your great object be victory not lengthy campaigns
1435064 in the practical art of war the best thing of all is to take the enemys country whole and intact to shatter and destroy it is not so good so too it is better to recapture an army entire than to destroy it to capture a regiment a detachment or a company entire than to destroy them hence to fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme intelligence supreme intelligence consists in breaking the enemys resistance without fighting
1435065 it is the rule in war if our forces are ten to the enemys one to surround him if five to one to attack him if twice as numerous to divide our army into two if equally matched we can offer battle if slightly inferior in numbers we can avoid the enemy if quite unequal in every way we can flee from him
1435066 there are three ways in which a ruler can bring misfortune upon his army by commanding the army to advance or to retreat being ignorant of the fact that is cannot obey this is called hobbling the army by attempting to govern an army in the same way as he administers a kingdom being ignorant of the conditions which obtain in an army this causes restlessness in the soldiers minds by employing the officers of his army without discrimination through ignorance of the military principal of adaptation to circumstances this shakes the confidence of the soldiers
1435067 sun tzu said whoever is first in the field and awaits the coming of the enemy will be fresh for the fight whoever is second in the field and has to hasten to battle will arrive exhausted
1435068 we can form a single united body while the enemy must split up into factions hence there will be a whole pitted against separate parts of a whole which means that we shall be many to the enemys few
1435069 rouse him and learn the principals of his activity or inactivity force him to reveal himself so as to find out his vulnerable spots
1435070 military tactics are like unto water for water in its natural course runs away from high places and hastens downwards so in war the way is to avoid what is strong and strike at what is weak
1435071 we are not fir to lead an army on the march unless we are familiar with the face of the country its mountains and forests its pitfalls and precipices its marshes and swamps we shall be unable to turn natural advantage to account less we make use of local guides
1435072 now a soldiers spirit is keenest in the morning by noonday it has begun to flag and in the evening his mind is bent only on returning to camp a clever general therefore avoids an army when its spirit is keen but attacks it when it is sluggish and inclined to return this is the art of studying moods
1435073 it is a military axiom not to advance uphill against the enemy nor to oppose him when he comes downhill
1435074 do not swallow bait offered by the enemy do not interfere with an army that is returning home
1435075 when you surround and army leave an outlet free do not press a desperate foe too hard
1435076 there are five dangerous faults which may affect a general recklessness which leads to destruction cowardice which leads to capture a hasty temper which can be provoked by insults a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame over solicitude for his men which exposes him to worry and trouble
1435077 camp in high places facing the sun do not climb heights in order to fight so much for mountain warfare
1435078 after crossing a river you should get far away from it when an invading force crosses a river in its onward march do not advance to meet it in mid stream it will be best to let half the army get across and then deliver your attack
1435079 if forced to fight in a salt marsh you should have water and grass near you and get your back to a clump of trees in dry level country take up an easily accessible position with rising ground to your right and on your rear so that the danger may be in front and safety lie behind if you are careful of your men and camp on hard ground the army will be free from disease of every kind and this will spell victory
1435080 if his place of encampment is easy of access he is tendering a bait
1435081 the rising of birds in their flight is the sign of an ambush startled beasts indicate that a sudden attack is coming
1435082 when some are seen advancing and some retreating it is a lure if those who are sent to draw water begin by drinking themselves the army is suffering from thirst if birds gather on any spot it is unoccupied clamor by night betokens nervousness
1435083 sun tzu said we may distinguish six kinds of terrain to wit accessible ground entangling ground temporizing ground narrow passes precipitous heights and positions at a great distance from the enemy
1435084 ground which can be freely traversed by both sides is called accessible with regard to this ground be before the enemy in occupying raised and sunny spots and carefully guard your line of supplies
1435085 ground which can be abandoned but is hard to reoccupy is called entangling for this ground if the enemy is unprepared you may go forth and defeat him but if the enemy is prepared for your coming and you fail to defeat him then return being impossible disaster will ensue
1435086 when the position is such that neither side will gain by making the first move it is called temporizing ground in this position even though the enemy should offer us an attractive bait it will be advisable not to stir forth but rather to retreat thus enticing the enemy in his turn then when part of his army has come out we may deliver our attack with advantage
1435087 with regard to narrow passes if you can occupy them first let them be strongly garrisoned and await the advent of the enemy
1435088 with regard to precipitous heights if you are beforehand with your adversary you should occupy the raised and sunny spots and there wait for him to come up if the enemy has occupied them before you do not follow him but retreat and try to entice him away
1435089 if you are situated at a great distance from the enemy and the strength of the two armies is equal it is not easy to provoke a battle and fighting will be to your disadvantage
1435090 an army is exposed to six calamities not arising from natural causes but from faults for which the general is responsible these are flight insubordination collapse ruin disorganization and rout
1435091 when the common soldiers are too strong and their officers too weak the result is insubordination when the officers are too strong and the common soldiers too weak the result is collapse when the higher officers are angry and insubordinate and on meeting the enemy gives battle on their own account from a feeling of resentment before the commander in chief can tell whether or not he is in a position to fight the result is ruin when the general is weak and without authority when his orders are not clear and distinct when there are no fixed duties assigned to officers and men and the ranks are formed in a slovenly manner the result it utter disorganization when a general unable to estimate the enemys strength allows an inferior force to engage a larger one or hurls a weak detachment against a powerful one and and neglects to place picked soldiers in the front rank the result must be rout
1435092 sun tzu said the art of war recognizes nine varieties of ground dispersive ground facile ground contentious ground open ground ground of intersecting highways serious ground difficult ground hemmed in ground desperate ground
1435093 when a chieftain is fighting in his own territory it is dispersive ground on dispersive ground i would inspire my men with unity of purpose
1435094 when he has penetrated into hostile territory but to no great distance it is facile ground on facile ground halt not and see that there is close connection between all parts of the army
1435095 ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side is contentious ground on this ground attack not and hurry up the rear
1435096 ground on which each side has liberty of movement is open ground on this ground do not try to block the enemys way and keep a vigilant eye on defenses
1435097 ground which forms the key to three contiguous states so that he who occupies it first has most of the empire at his command is a ground of intersecting highways on this ground i would consolidate my alliances
1435098 when an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear it is serious ground on this ground gather in plunder what you take from the enemy and ensure a continuous stream of supplies
1435099 mountain forests rugged steeps marshes and fens all country that is hard to traverse this is difficult ground on this ground keep steady to the march and keep pushing along the road
1435100 ground which is reached through narrow gorges and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men this is hemmed in ground on this ground resort to strategy and block any way of retreat
1435101 ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay is desperate ground on this ground fight and proclaim to your soldiers the hopelessness of saving their lives for it is the soldiers disposition to offer an obstinate resistance when surrounded to fight hard when he cannot help himself and to obey promptly when he has fallen into danger
1435102 those who were called skillful leaders of old knew how to drive a wedge between the enemys front and rear to prevent cooperation between his large and small divisions to hinder the good troops from rescuing the bad the officers from rallying their men
1435103 sun tzu said there are five ways of attacking with fire to burn soldiers in their camp to burn stores to burn baggage trains to burn arsenals and to hurl dropping fire against the enemy the materials for raising fire should always be kept in readiness in attacking with fire be ready for five scenarios when a fire breaks out inside to an enemys camp respond at once with an attack from outside the camp if there is an outbreak of fire but the enemy remains quiet bide your time and do not attack when the force of the flames has reached its height follow it up with an attack if practicable if you can attack with fire from outside the enemy camp then do so and not wait for it to break out within when you start a fire be windward of it
1435104 none should be more generously rewarded than spies the five types of spies local spies inhabitants of a district inward spies officials of the enemy converted spies getting hold of the enemys spies and using them for our own purposes doomed spies spies we report to the enemy and surviving spies spies who bring back news from the enemys camp if a secret piece of news is divulged by a spy before the time is ripe he must be put to death

1435197 only mccain has taken on big tobacco drug companies fought corruption in both parties hell reform wall street battle big oil make america prosper again hes the original maverick one is ready to lead mccain
1435198 being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years
1435199 this plan will not lower prices today it will not lower prices during the next administration the truth is we wouldnt see a drop of oil from john mccains plan for at least the next seven years

1435212 i like to take shapes that alone dont carry any emotional feeling but by their intersecting of each other start to talk to us emotionally
1435213 for me its really analogous to music the composer doesnt invent notes theyre all there on the piano its the repetition of the notes and their relationship with each other that makes the difference between something thats noise and banal and something thats profound and moving i want you to see these penetrations because there are wonderful secondary shapes that happen i think of them like chords in music
1435214 i dont ever make anything that emulates them but theyre sources of wonderful shapes
1435215 nature is the source of all shapes people tend to think that the geometric stuff i do relates to architecture and mathematics but i dont its more about crystals and plate tectonics and geology

1435337 shortchange those veterans who suffer from non combat related conditions
1435338 not only has mccain voted the wrong way on veterans issues such as opposing increased funding for veterans health care the last four years in a row but he also doesnt support middle class peoples issues
1435339 he wants to tax peoples health care benefits and supports unfair trade deals including nafta
1435340 despite tabloid speculation mary kate olsen had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs found in heath ledgers home or his body and she does not know where he obtained them
1435341 regarding the governments investigation at ms olsens request we have provided the government with relevant information including facts in the chronology of events surrounding mr ledgers death and the fact that ms olsen does not know the source of the drugs mr ledger consumed
1435342 we dont know the source of the information being quoted in the media regarding the governments inquiry but these descriptions are incomplete and inaccurate

1435351 its ok for him to murder cab drivers i am a video game store owner
1435352 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1435353 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1435354 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1435355 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1435356 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1435357 at the end of the day well have to achieve agreement and it remains to be seen whether the government will find this an acceptable attractive alternative to what theyve already proposed
1435358 demian has put together a couple of wins in the ufc and i guess hes placed himself in a position where they want to test him
1435359 the one thing demian maia has is he always has that threat to submit you at any time
1435360 i believe strongly that his overall mixed martial arts game is nowhere near the level of his grappling game
1435361 so obviously i feel i have more experience against tougher competition and a heck of a lot more experience in the mixed martial arts world and im going to try and use those two things to my favour in this fight
1435362 and certainly demian maia in my opinion is nowhere the level of standup than those guys had
1435363 i want to fight the guys that are scratching and clawing at the top of this division but im not looking past demian maia its very clear to me that i have to take out demian maia to consolidate my spot as one of the top guys in this division
1435364 the middleweight divisions in desperate need of a contender right now
1435365 everybodys jockeying for position under anderson right now and any one fighter that can string together two or three quality wins will become the next contender and pat was able to do that
1435366 i couldnt speak highly enough of the guys as far as the team atmosphere and making me comfortable and the level of training
1435367 but i was living in a gym and just really really out of my comfort zone
1435368 i wouldnt say that was the reason for me being unsuccessful you know what im more comfortable at home in my comfort zone with all my resources that i have on hand i feel like im getting everything i need right here right now and i feel like im getting better ever fight so im not going to change it up
1435369 i stayed at home and stuck with what works for me
1435370 for me my comfort zone is at home close to my family close to my three kids obviously i have a new business so close to my new business and i feel like im getting the training im needing here i have great coaches and im fighting a jiu jitsu black belt so why would i travel away from josh russell when hes right here with me

1435379 judaism discovered a study of the anti biblical religion of racism self worship superstition and deceit
1435380 which in the past has had a well deserved reputation as a bastion of freedom of the press fierce opposition to judaism discovered was of course expected mr zapolskys aug 3 communication was so partisan it was akin to a hazmana from a beit din it seems that when judasm is radically challenged there are no limits to the tribal solidarity that coalesces to fight threats to its immunity an immunity not enjoyed by christianity or islam
1435381 as i stated in my desideratum essay the only argument that judaism discovered cant overcome is the silent treatment if the book is denied distribution advertising and publicity the enemies of truth will have carried the day in the only way they can through suppression and censorship

1435612 after all the work in the classroom with students its great to see the fruits of their work
1435613 for many of them this was the first time they had done an engineering project from start to finish
1435614 within a week i was standing in front of 300 sixth graders
1435615 the only really bad thing that happened was that our fuse blew
1435616 it was an amazing project for sixth graders to actually build something from scratch is one of the biggest projects weve ever had
1435617 it was lot harder to operate than it actually looked
1435618 you expect it to do one thing and it does something slightly different
1435619 anyone who wanted to could have put in a bid
1435620 as of now we just have two which is 100 percent more than we had before i think the competition will serve to strengthen both companies customer service
1435621 comcast worked very closely with the manassas franchise authority to create an agreement that we feel is fair to both comcast and our customers
1435622 from a competitive standpoint we are very confident in our network and in the products and services we deliver today throughout northern virginia
1435623 as i have indicated before this is an unusual situation
1435624 i am recommending that with the voluntary commitments sirius and xm have offered on balance this transaction would be in the public interest
1435625 this proposed merger merits the utmost scrutiny by antitrust officials and telecommunications policymakers to ensure that competition and consumers are fully protected
1435626 this is a perfect fit with alltels high value post paid customer base its solid financials our common network technology
1435627 this deal will speed the unfortunate trend of giving consumers fewer rather than more choices in telecommunications services while giving a few companies more control over the lives of consumers
1435628 we identify the best people and then free them up to do what they want to do and to be flexible and change directions and follow their noses into new fields
1435629 todays medicine is the beneficiary of scientific inquiry that took place decades ago
1435630 our goal in funding the basic biomedical sciences is to lay the groundwork for the medical discoveries that will take place 20 30 40 years from now
1435631 ive never seen anybody get so animated over butts and elvis as those two

1435636 kunne blive brugt til politisk spin for at vise krigens grusomhed
1435637 jeg skammer mig over at sige det men der var endda folk i den medicinske afdeling der sagde det bliver over mit lig at dette kommer ud til civile amerikanere
1435638 en soldat med hjelm p drog sig en skade i panden i forbindelse med en eksploderende vejsidebombe han sad p fors det i en humvee
1435639 den medicinske afdeling af det amerikanske milit r mener selvf lgelig at det er af yderste vigtighed at alle oplysninger der kan v re til nytte i behandlingen af soldater er tilg ngelige mens andre mere politiske afdelinger har nogle andre hensyn
1435640 offentligg relse af billeder af alt hvad der hedder tab har jo v ret forbundet med restriktioner ikke engang billeder af kister har v ret tilg ngelige det handler om at man er blevet mere opm rksom p billeders magt det er jo bestemt ikke i pentagons interesse at der bliver vist billeder af d de soldater og gr dende p r rende
1435641 det passer ikke til den forst else amerikanerne har af en amerikansk soldat at blive et tilf ldigt offer for en vejsidebombe virker ikke umiddelbart lige s heroisk som at falde i kamp det er klart i pentagons interesse at amerikanerne bevarer en mere gammeldags opfattelse af krig
1435642 d dstal er langt mere abstrakte og meget sv rere at forholde sig til for den gennemsnitlige amerikaner end det voksende antal invaliderede soldater man m der p gaden det svarer igen ikke til amerikanernes forst else af krig derfor kan det at l gerne faktisk redder langt flere end tidligere g hen og blive et st rre problem for milit ret end tabstallet kan
1435643 debray understregede lidt for kraftigt hvor megen nytte han kunne g re udefra
1435644 jeg ved du er kommet for at skyde mig skyd kujon du dr ber bare en mand
1435645 den handling delagde idealer som vi alle havde det h nger ikke sammen at k mpe for en bedre verden og s samtidig skyde sine egne
1435646 det er ikke noget nyt at familiemedlemmer kan f lge eu borgere rundt n r de benytter sig af retten til fri bev gelighed over landegr nserne
1435647 og det er b de fornuftigt godt og rigtigt for hvis ikke eu borgere kunne tage familien med rundt kunne det v re en blokering for den fri bev gelighed p arbejdsmarkedet
1435648 tilbage st r at danskere med udenlandske gtef ller har ret til at bruge eu reglerne til at f dem med hjem til danmark nu savner jeg bare at han sl r fast at vejledningspligten ogs g lder for vk regeringen og at danskerne fremover vil blive vejledt efter eus regler
1435649 det er det store problem der er ikke noget tilbage af det overhovedet fogh kan ikke slippe af sted med at sige at udl ndingepolitikken ligger fast uden at sige hvad han s vil g re ved det megastore problem som regeringen og socialdemokraterne selv har skabt
1435650 han bliver n dt til at tage et opg r med det opholdsdirektiv hvis han har andre muligheder h ber jeg at han vil benbare dem en af dagene

1435652 120 degrees outside and that guy is wearing a leather jacket you see that
1435653 yeah im glad he didnt get on the elevator with us let us ride it down before he blows it up
1435654 because we now believe irregularities may have occurred that could have compromised the overall fairness of the process
1435655 it started off with moderate comments but they got more emboldened and brazen they feed off of each other over there without anyone to rein them in
1435656 block people that upset me or anyone who attacks me personally
1435657 imagine a gigantic fake pine rising 40 feet above the rest of the trees thats what we would have had here
1435658 we sell scenery our rural tourism business is booming and that is because of the way the area looks
1435659 i think the big losers are the residents in western loudoun county who believed the countys pronouncements about being internet enabled and connected
1435660 basically the infrastructure is not there now and is not going to be there for the foreseeable future
1435661 i feel these are needed from a public safety perspective and to make sure our residents in western loudoun are not part of the technological divide
1435662 this is going to be a tough decision to make but its one we need to make for the future of the county
1435663 when this comprehensive system is in place any cellphone can be used aboveground and in the tunnels and this network can be used by all our operational employees as well
1435664 were going to have less money for the same number of people
1435665 we were afraid that some of the immigrants might be fearful
1435666 we want to assure those folks that are immigrants that there is no fear with doing this
1435667 the census is all about getting our fair share of money weve already paid
1435668 theres no more fundamental service than educating our kids the state funding is critical its vital we get our share of the state resources
1435669 the process to switch providers is more cumbersome for consumers this significantly complicates the process of switching video providers thereby entrenching the cable incumbents dominant market position
1435670 verizons fairy tale complaint is a lame attempt to deflect criticism from its years long illegal practice of misusing proprietary information to prevent consumers from switching to a new phone provider
1435671 at the heart of all this is the fact that the boundaries between what phone companies provide and cable companies provide are getting blurrier and blurrier
1435672 next year through bribery or trickery i hope to persuade ken bernstein teacher and blogger par excellence to select his favorite blogs and then let me dump on his choices or something like that
1435673 the telecommunication investment levels have not rebounded in the same manner that information technology and life sciences have
1435674 more of our companies were telecommunications centric than many other parts of the country its just taken a longer period to lick your wounds and get back on the horse again
1435675 it became clear that one of the things retarding growth of companies in this whole region was the absence of venture capitalists
1435676 its really much more of a balanced town than it used to be
1435677 the internet and telecom continue to move ahead you had companies that grew up like
1435678 angry 75 year old virginia woman attacks manassas cable office with hammer
1435679 you always want to treat people as you want to be treated but people also have the tendency to fly off the handle more quickly these days
1435680 these are complicated issues and technologies that can take longer to sort out or fix
1435681 and a consumer just wants to get good service for phone internet and wireless and doesnt understand why it has to be so complicated
1435682 this move is consistent with our new growth strategy and will enable us to focus on our defined growth areas
1435683 sony has been an excellent partner and they are the right company to take this business to the next step and ensure that it realizes its full value and potential
1435684 i dont invent the things on the internet i make them better
1435685 tits ass boobs pussy cock and other animals that are also dirty words
1435686 we were just waiting to see if this one had any use and it turns out it really doesnt
1435687 i think a lot of people are going to use the digital switch as a reason to buy a new tv
1435688 the question is what happens to all the tvs people are getting rid of
1435689 the fact that sheen and petersen both happen to be on cbs is coincidental
1435690 theyre at the very top of their game and are the best at what they do youd expect them to be at the top of the scale
1435691 its nice to be able to stay here and do that
1435692 especially something like buying a house that can be really tedious
1435693 the more information someone has the more likely they are to make a purchase
1435694 learning negatives about the house removes the uncertainty factor which is more of a hindrance than having the information
1435695 i dont trust listing agents photos they represent only the best side and make it look amazing it is not necessarily what they look like when you get there
1435696 the policy that we were fighting was adopted five years ago things have changed
1435697 as a realtor they charge me a fee to get that buyer back when they havent done anything i have an issue with that
1435698 you cant change the fact that it is in the basement but you can adjust the price
1435699 these days our job as a realtor is to help negotiate the deal instead of just finding the house for them
1435700 you can do it all in the middle of the night when you cant sleep
1435701 what were trying to demonstrate is that we can do these things and still have integrity and aesthetics and it can be fascinating and entertaining
1435702 a friend of mine gonzalez was killed by lightning this year any of us could have gotten hit and i wasnt going to play again so i sprinted off the field
1435703 everybody was at risk everybody its not like it was just a slippery field and the players had a chance to get hurt everybody was at risk what if that had hit the stands
1435704 our job is to try to get the game in
1435705 you do the best you can do at the time i understand players dont want to be out there i dont want to be out there
1435706 there was no need to be out there when the lightning is that close
1435707 theres only two really options if youre out in something like that you either have never seen a lightning storm before or youre a complete idiot
1435708 so i dont want to accuse the people that were hanging out in the stands and stuff of being idiots but i guess theyve never seen lightning well think about it people get killed by lightning strikes all the time its not likely to happen but its a heck of a lot more likely if youre standing outside in a lightning storm its one of those things where the people when a tragedy ends up happening its because people dont have respect for it nobody thats ever been struck by lightning probably thought theyd be struck by lightning
1435709 once berkman told me about biggios friend i was worried
1435710 look im back there with all that equipment out there
1435711 no matter what decision you make somebodys not going to be happy to me bell did an incredible job
1435712 im not trying to put in on cubs general manager jim hendry or anything like that but whoever is in charge of the cubs and their operations here if it was me when the tornado sirens went off the first time i would have immediately said were not playing this game
1435713 you got reports of severe weather you got to keep some perspective here
1435714 this is a baseball game and these games are important because teams are trying to make the playoffs and everybody understands that
1435715 you put umpires in a bad spot because everybodys like well its on them they got to make the call well i mean theyre getting all kinds of pressure so i dont blame them i think somebodys got to step up in a situation like that and say look yes we all want to win a world series here we all want to make the playoffs but there comes a point and time when youve got to just say stop i guess in our modern day of technology people say oh well the radar says this well im standing outside there and i can see the lightning hit the firehouse 100 yards behind the stadium so i dont need a radar to tell me that
1435716 i would love to see you showcase your work there
1435717 what were seeing here is a clear pattern of repeated violations of patient medical records and patient confidentiality by ucla
1435718 whats startling to us is as we get to a point where we feel weve addressed a specific complaint and a specific issue we identify additional issues
1435719 ucla should have detected the violations by ms jackson years ago and should have immediately initiated the process to dismiss her
1435720 all other employees who were found to have violated patient confidentiality during our review have been disciplined including some who have been terminated
1435721 on behalf of the entire leadership of the ucla health system i am deeply sorry for this failure and the personal distress these breaches may have caused
1435722 californians have every right to expect their medical records to be safeguarded and protected and i am alarmed about repeated violations of patient confidentiality and the potential harm to the citizens of this state
1435723 by putting financial penalties in place for those employees and facilities that do not follow these laws this legislation will lead to better care for all californians
1435724 we learned to strip the machine gun on a ground sheet change barrels belt ammo feed ammo into the gun clear a jam and fire the weapon
1435725 the classes with the marines simply offered the contractors an opportunity to escape the monotony of atoll life
1435726 thats the reason why you eat bread but you build houses out of wood
1435727 it eats what nobody else will eat cornstalks leftover chaff from hay or whatever and can turn that into ethanol

1435731 instead of gaining capital to burn while continuing to build or seek an advertising solution we now have one of the most prominent advertising solutions out there along with increased distribution a road map for expansion and a guarantee that i believe is an unprecedented deal for this space
1435732 it is not necessary to always follow suit when the bank rate increases
1435733 consultation was done in four major villages namely masunga maun tsabong and molepolole
1435734 the consensus of the public was that the country needed no such law
1435735 we were told that the bill would go through with or without the involvement of media practitioners
1435736 the aim of holding such annual festivals is to ensure the catholic church promotes music and friendship amongst the people of god choral music is a maturing art in botswana and the catholic church has taken a giant step to take part in the nurturing of talent and encourage young and old batswana in this form of art music also forms an integral part in the liturgy of the church

1435738 so small that trillions could rest on the head of a pin
1435739 it is always the duty of parliament to approve loans of such nature
1435740 but why look whats happening now look at the confusion and i whose life and future is being debated can only wait anxiously to know if i have been thrown to the crocodiles or whether i remain in the same pool with a cautioned and warned croc and what may i ask will i do if i find out after they have signed more agreements shook hands and toasted each other that my life and future have been made worse
1435741 exclusion of csos civil society and the wider society in the mediation process gives the impression that the problem in zimbabwe is between zanu pf and the mdc it ignores the fact that the crisis is one of governance and therefore an issue for all zimbabweans
1435742 indeed we are seeing patients not many of them are fresh injuries they are old injuries that are coming out probably before the june 27th election they were afraid to come out for fear of further victimisation but sadly they are presenting us with complications which are difficult to correct
1435743 my global brothers and sisters who share the sorrow of aids and the hope of overcoming it
1435744 to all in the audience living with and affected by hiv aids i say welcome
1435745 together on the eve of this great global conference let us take a moment to look back and to see how far we have come
1435746 ladies and gentlemen over one million of those people who started therapy for the first time last year did so in the continent of africa
1435747 the drugs are too expensive there was fear that the patients would not understand the complex regimens that there would be an epidemic of resistant hiv
1435748 i believe we have all come to this conference because we share a profound commitment to preventing new infections extending treatment and care to all people with hiv and mitigating the impact of aids
1435749 africa especially southern africa remains disproportionally affected by the epidemic
1435750 id like to quote one of the recommendations from the united nations un secretary generals report for the high level meeting on aids held in new york in june this year it says
1435751 we need innovation and a new spirit of vigour in hiv prevention in southern africa

1435760 do you know how long its been in your belly
1435761 not everybody in richmond that day lived in richmond this is a very mobile society
1435762 we need the ability to send these messages very precisely for them to be of any value
1435763 you have different capabilities of the various devices of the various carriers
1435764 some are very skeptical of the government or anybody else knowing their whereabouts at all times
1435765 we were literally days away from having to decide to abandon the 2008 season
1435766 for companies to be able to turn around sponsorship and funding at these levels without prior budgeting is extremely unusual to say it was gratifying is an understatement
1435767 anyone want to go in the marines youll be comforted to know we have one of these offshore does that look pretty neat its all composite none of thats steel
1435768 they had some type of smoke or odor in the cabin
1435769 both companies are still losing over 100 million a quarter and not making dramatic improvement in lowering losses

1435776 reminded me of the early days of the internet where it was digital natives the people who grew up with technology who saw the future
1435777 the challenge that he and other early entrepreneurs face is how much control are they willing to give up both financially and intellectually
1435778 part of the challenge is how do you want to present yourself
1435779 latest headline news pet waste has now become a problem
1435780 that is probably not the first mental image you want readers to have
1435781 the idea was to put a positive face on a neighborhood in southeast

1435783 from the beginning the county has tried to ensure good cable service in two ways by regulating cable companies and by helping to provide greater competition
1435784 competition is not new to comcast and we already operate in an extremely competitive environment in montgomery county we compete every day for video internet and phone customers
1435785 competition is good for consumers at least in principle thats not always the case in cable providers where they raise rates despite competition
1435786 he understood what it took to take all the parts and build a winning team
1435787 the way he did it in basketball applies to being successful in just about any field including government

1435799 i have a penthouse that is soft modern and sleek the fireplace isnt fussy and the tv is so contemporary its almost like another piece of art
1435800 its worth displaying proudly it was more expensive than a lot of my furniture after all
1435801 i have hundreds of recipes on my laptop and when i cook i just download the one that i want to the tv
1435802 while the temporary tax credit is certainly a positive for buyers the tax credit does not offset the elimination of the down payment assistance program which our industry so vitally needs
1435803 this has been an exciting opportunity to reach out to ohio voters in all 2088 counties the response has been overwhelmingly favorable we are very appreciative of the effort of hundreds of ohioans who have helped us in this effort to place this issue on the november 4th ballot ohioans are excited for this positive economic news the prospect of up to 5000 new jobs is a bright spot in a year in which we have faced so much financial adversity and challenges we look forward to a positive and honest campaign to get the support of ohio voters we look towards our opposition to come from casinos in states that neighbor ohio as they have enjoyed the economic benefits from ohioans for many years when this issue passes their free lunch will end
1435804 a sixteen year old student enrolled in an independent study program through a private school was detained by the police while on his way to meet with a tutor the student produced his school id card for the officer but to no avail he was given a citation for not having a note from his school to explain his absence

1435814 his manner the environment officers was aggressive and offensive throughout
1435815 he didnt even introduce himself with any basic courtesies i felt intimidated humiliated and threatened
1435816 i decided id had enough and shut the door on him i was just shutting the top bolt too when he started pushing against the door
1435817 i thought what sort of state of state do we live in where people are being persecuted and intimidated in this way for what they found an address label with some rubbish at a recycling point
1435818 when my car was vandalised a couple of years ago it took three phone calls and a week to get a policeman round to my house but here we have a policeman coming round to my house with a recycling officer within less than half an hour
1435819 we try and keep the recycle centres and places where people take their refuse tidy and we have signs that we want to keep it tidy
1435820 i personally find it annoying when i go to a recycling centre to find lots of cardboard bags and sacks all around

1435836 her death has shocked everybody vicky was lovely a great friend the friendliest person i have ever met and wouldnt hurt a fly
1435837 she talked about how she survived the war so for her to die in this way is just tragic
1435838 vicky was looking forward to her daughter who lives in scotland coming to visit her soon
1435839 she was to be a great grandmother for the first time in a couple of months she was always buying things like booties and would be excited saying look at what ive got for the baby
1435840 that she should die like that is disgusting and disgraceful
1435841 she was nice and a very good friend she was so happy looking forward to her daughter coming and this is so sad

1435850 it seems to be an example of systematic planned doping

1435853 developing an aids vaccine may take more time and innovation than we might have once imagined but we are confident that science will prevail the necessary direction for the field is clear
1435854 we have got to create this new mechanism to be able to turn the aids vaccine into a normal product development initiative so that every time there a failure it doesnt raise the question of whether this is the end of the line
1435855 strong scientific evidence in both humans and animal models suggests that developing an aids vaccine is possible
1435856 before vaccines go into efficacy trials they need to go through a set of screenings to look at evidence they are significantly better
1435857 we are pushing a whole new generation of vectors we have got candidates coming down the pipeline on that

1435867 it was something where it grabbed and popped and got stiff
1435868 this does seem to be an example of systematic planned doping and under the new wada code that would mean an expanded ban of four years
1435869 the federation have done a very good job in revealing a very bad doping story which is just frustrating to find
1435870 its sad and very disappointing that this type of planned cheating is still going on
1435871 there is a due procedure for the russian federation to follow but the data is convincing and the dna analysis is 100

1435879 truth eludes us if we do not concentrate with total attention on its pursuit and even while it eludes us the illusion still lingers of knowing it and leads to many misunderstandings also truth is seldom pleasant it is almost invariably bitter
1435880 the western world has lost its civil courage both as a whole and separately in each country each government each political party and of course in the united nations such a decline in courage is particularly noticeable among the ruling groups and the intellectual elite causing an impression of loss of courage by the entire society of course there are many courageous individuals but they have no determining influence on public life political and intellectual bureaucrats show depression passivity and perplexity in their actions and in their statements and even more so in theoretical reflections to explain how realistic reasonable as well as intellectually and even morally warranted it is to base state policies on weakness and cowardice and decline in courage is ironically emphasized by occasional explosions of anger and inflexibility on the part of the same bureaucrats when dealing with weak governments and weak countries not supported by anyone or with currents which cannot offer any resistance but they get tongue tied and paralyzed when they deal with powerful governments and threatening forces with aggressors and international terrorists
1435881 should one point out that from ancient times a decline in courage has been considered the beginning of the end

1435899 i dont see many areas of the market where were truly growing growing by shrinking is great for a quarter or two but not a sustainable story
1435900 i think the fed would rather wait until after the election before they consider raising rates
1435901 that will give them time to get a better view of the economy and see if financial markets have become less fragile

1435926 the risks were obvious and should have been assessed a little more carefully the result is there was a crisis affecting the games
1435927 in my country and in many other countries in my part of the world we were in full boycott mode
1435928 public opinion and political opinion was moving toward an actual boycott of the games and it was only the earthquake tragedy that diverted attention from what could otherwise have been something very very serious its been done and resolved and we escaped this disaster
1435929 it is illusory to think the simple elimination of the international relay will make all the problems disappear
1435930 the torch relay attracts the media and the media attracts the protesters to make it only a national relay will not solve all the problems
1435931 we respect protests and freedom of expression but violence is against the olympic spirit
1435932 we believe in the strong symbolism of the torch relay
1435933 with regards to internet access there appears to have been last minute progress achieved

1435972 we can expect to see an increase in olympics themed spam blog comments and forum posts that try to entice potential victims into visiting malicious websites under the auspices of viewing video or other content related to the games
1435973 potentially there may also be an increase in the compromise of legitimate websites that feature olympics related content in order to exploit the heightened traffic that may result
1435974 more and more legitimate sites are being targeted by attackers and websites where the olympic games are streamed online by broadcasters could be a prime area for compromise

1435992 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1435993 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1435994 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1435995 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1435996 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1435997 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1435998 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1435999 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1436000 the key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue

1436046 taken all together how would you say things are these days would you say that you are very happy pretty happy or not too happy
1436047 these changes yield some pretty striking changes in the distribution of happiness
1436048 the key to understanding any teenager is to treat them with respect by listening to what they have to say rather than typecasting them according to the type of music they listen to
1436049 we need to see what the plan is if its no capital injection and simply wishy washy rubbish there wont be a moratorium there will be liquidation and that would be disastrous 50 cents in the dollar for debenture holders and capital note holders get nothing
1436050 i dont think watson and hotchin are worth the kinds of money national business review said they are in the 2008 rich list but they could certainly raise some dough 30 million 40 million perhaps 50 million would be a genuinely meaningful amount
1436051 that would make me say lets go for a moratorium and lets see if we can bide some time to get people most of their money back
1436052 there are significant problems and some of their loans are quite frankly going to need a lot of time and luck to get out of
1436053 five hundred and fifty four million dollars of public money sitting at 10 per cent plus penalty now accruing because of default equals the thick end of 60 million a year plus say 60 million of fortress money at say 20 per cent equals at least 10 million a year
1436054 the hanover trustee appears to be in denial of the gravity of the hanover default
1436055 weve got a hell of a lot of work to do in terms of taking this industry forward weve got to advocate and lobby a hell of a lot harder if we actually want to be successful
1436056 we think the consumer is out for the count for the foreseeable future
1436057 the rapid rise in commodity prices is good news for new zealand
1436058 while yes there has been a number of calls and some outflows it hasnt been that significant yet
1436059 if we get through the third quarter reporting round in the us without too much more blood on the carpet one would have to assume that things might start to look up again

1436066 if you want to change attitudes start with a change in behavior in other words begin to act the part as well as you can of the person you would rather be the person you must want to become gradually the old fearful person will fade away
1436067 i dont like it when people easily condemn someone who has an addiction as if he were a criminal as if he were a person who should be persecuted
1436068 decriminalization of the consumer should include what are called second generation human rights but at the same time there should be a strong policy of prevention so that no one falls in the situation of consuming any substance
1436069 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1436070 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1436071 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1436072 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1436073 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1436074 the lessons dick cheney learned from watergate and its aftermath
1436075 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1436076 the official mass medias already crying crocodile ears over the death of the nations conscience but we know how he fought for the us and global capitalism against the soviet union have your say now lets top the yandex ratings and show these professional lying bastards
1436077 we rate solzhenitsyn it just makes me sad that someone could write such revolting stuff on the day of his death i beg you join in the post we rate solzhenitsyn you can do it like this
1436078 the very act of standing for the truth changes everything
1436079 i honestly believe that the future is going to be millions of little things saving us
1436080 i honestly believe that the future is going to be millions of little things saving us
1436081 whatever you do or dream you can do begin it boldness has genius and power and magic in it
1436082 calls are not being returned by city hall and we are not in the loop
1436083 i am determined to ensure that every man and woman in this city can feel safe when they travel around london from the moment they leave their home to the moment they return they should be able to travel in confidence removing touts from our streets will be another step in the right direction
1436084 most touts are unlicensed drivers among licensed drivers the public carriage office pco accepts that touting is largely a problem within the private hire trade however there have been occurrences of touting by licensed taxi drivers for example at liverpool street station and at heathrow airport in the interests of fairness to all drivers and to prevent legal challenge to tfl we must take a consistent approach to touting by both private hire and taxi drivers
1436085 if within one month we do not have a meeting with representatives of the mayor we will mobilise seven to eight thousand black cabs around city hall and tower bridge and block london off
1436086 it is about time the pco setup two separate entities for the private hire and black cab drivers
1436087 prevent s the normal agency trade between matching public orders and instead interpose s himself between the matching orders in order to generate profit for the principal account
1436088 he trades for his own account before undertaking trades for public investors
1436089 interpositioning constituted a deceptive act within the meaning of the federal securities laws because the government did not provide proof of customer expectations
1436090 u nless the publics understanding is based on an the source for that understanding whether it be a regulation an accounting practice or something else does not matter
1436091 see all pending orders to buy and sell a particular stock and he determined the price ultimately paid
1436092 manipulation or a false statement a breach of a duty to disclose or deceptive communicative conduct
1436093 a violation of a nyse rule does not establish securities fraud in the civil context let alone in a criminal prosecution
1436094 bespeak criminally fraudulent conduct with the context of the securities laws
1436095 oh is there lint floating in the air that i havent counted
1436096 but honey it will look really good in 60 years
1436097 im not a democrat or a republican im a christian
1436098 part of what makes fallout great is the juxtaposition of this very happy optimistic 1950s esque view of life pre war and then seeing it after things went horribly wrong
1436099 its seeing those two things against one another that adds a lot to it that everything is blown up but you still see this happy optimism and idealistic view of the world beforehand
1436100 but from a certain standpoint it limits what the game is really about to define it by saying youre just this genre sort of says you cant ever be more than that its a big sandbox and you get to be whoever you want and do whatever you want
1436101 no fucking way absolutely not with our experience on rpgs like elder scrolls things like lore and canon we hold very dear we get anal about which buildings should be in washington dc with giant piles of books on architecture on dc and we ask what year buildings were made 1955 its out it wouldnt have been in this universe if were going to be anal about the landscape in this game were certainly not going to make jokes about stuff that would not have been part of this world at all
1436102 we owe a huge debt to osu and we are fortunate enough to be in a position to give back
1436103 we both had scholarships when we went to college and we really wanted to support students its one of the most important things to us
1436104 the measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with but whether its the same problem you had last year
1436105 plans to introduce netbook models designed specifically for students and educators
1436106 the measure of success is not whether you have a tough problem to deal with but whether its the same problem you had last year
1436107 these eyes are not me i am not caught by these eyes this body is not me i am not caught by this body i am life without boundaries i have never been born i will never die
1436108 yes i feel your hands i know my foot is there
1436109 do you know we learned a lot from you when we lived and worked together the work you began many of us are continuing to do please dont worry about anything
1436110 stop fooling around with google or yahoo and find a real web host in addition if youre a serious blogger you should have a web host where you pay for the service if youre using a free service how in the hell can you bitch about the service
1436111 i have no doubts in my mind that at its core and for everything that it provides that fallout is a better game than oblivion was for sure
1436112 ich habe keine zweifel daran dass fallout 3 im kern und mit allem was es bietet ein besseres spiel als oblivion ist
1436113 but were also not oblivious to the fact that we have a lot of extra baggage that were carrying being the guys picking up this franchise that are re imagining this series from 10 years ago and theres something that comes along with that were very well aware of what were up against
1436114 proposing or analyzing transactions that require the creation elimination and or restructuring of entities within the wal mart corporate structure and that would produce tax savings
1436115 dreams are not which you see while you sleep dreams are something which never lets you sleep until they realized
1436116 timing is the ingredient which along with the passion and commitment can execute n no of dreams togather if you are faithful for each one
1436117 though i know this is not wrong decision still it is being proved to be wrong as many of us feels so
1436118 dream is an illusion hard to realize and tough to see
1436119 the fotolia corporate subscription service grants customers complete control over media buying enabling account owners to manage multiple users within a single organization tied to a central account

1436121 adults are always asking little kids what they want to be when they grow up because they are trying to get ideas
1436122 advances in semiconductor technology continue to deliver huge benefits to consumers as semiconductor devices deliver higher performance and increased functionality at lower cost
1436123 at the same time rapid price declines for microchips tend to mask the real growth of the industry the cost of 1gb of dram has declined by as much as 43 percent during the past year while the price of 2gb of nand flash has declined by as much as 61 percent in the last 12 months
1436124 thisll be the last time i set foot in this apartment and thisll be the last time you set foot in this apartment
1436125 i am no where going to fight like a moron for such a life where everytime people fight for the excellence

1436129 if i wanted to see a douche id head on over to walgreens and stand in front of the summers eve display
1436130 reminiscent of benito mussolinis edict of the 1920s which banned groups of five or more people
1436131 gatherings in a bid to protect public decorum and prevent damage to public parks and gardens
1436132 there is no emergency situation in novara there is no need for such a fascist edict there are other better ways to tackle the citys problems
1436133 this is needed to limit public disturbance the citizens of novara asked for it i understand opposition left councillors plan to gather and protest in groups of more than three we will not fine them this time
1436134 one thing i will say though is that to compare the ordinance with fascism is absurd we are trying to solve issues but are being accused of fascism
1436135 i really dont see the need for troops on streets it will have a completely negative effect
1436136 i have already had people calling me after reading reports of troops on streets in italy and asking me is there some sort of civil war going on
1436137 its an image boosting operation that risks turning into a boomerang
1436138 it will make italy look like a country in the grip of an uncontrolled security emergency
1436139 paratroopers guarding the centres of the major tourist cities arent exactly a great calling card for a country at the height of the tourist season
1436140 we will have one soldier for every 10 municipalities doing nothing except going to the bar with a policeman its a joke and to cap it all its only a provisional measure

1436142 if i wanted to i could go that route and be respected not for my success respected for my music and my lyrics or whatever
1436143 i did a mixtape called teen of the south with dj scream and i did that just to step my game up a little bit on that lyrical side but i wasnt really going into no album and just full fledge trying to switch my swagger and try to get respect from the game cause why would i show love to the game the game dont show you love back so i wasnt gonna do that and come back out and mess up my image and mess up myself i was going on the strength that i want respect from people who probably dont like me anyway so im gonna stick to what i do and stay being successful and ill do some mixtapes and some futures something like that

1436180 on inflation adjusted basis shipments were down 638 million or 7 3 compared to june 2007
1436181 the last few months data have shown a difficult time for the industry
1436182 even though the recent gdp estimates for the second quarter were positive corporations are squeezing discretionary spending to cope with rising costs and a worsening inflation outlook our report indicates that the number of people in graphic design and advertising production were down significantly in june this is important because many print campaigns for the fall and holiday shopping seasons are developed in the summer for this reason we have decreased our forecasts for the rest of the year and updated our forecasts through 2013
1436183 the only content creation sector that has had an increase in employment is public relations its an affirmation of the strength of the internet and its ability to reach audiences through search engines and other new formats its essential that printers tap into this trend with efforts that make public relations promotions events and sponsorships more effective with their target audiences

1436186 i just wish i had known i was under surveillance because i wouldve asked them for a ride home after the meetings because i had a long way to go
1436187 it was all very straightforward and very much what people do when theyre trying to get other people aware of the problems that are going on and things that need to get fixed in the world
1436188 i had no reason to be under surveillance believe you me
1436189 they probably felt threatened by what we were going on about and we were very vocal about it and we wanted to see change maybe that was a bit upsetting to see women gather in that kind of strength and conviction
1436190 with some reduction in forward speed expected over the next day or two
1436191 healthy incoming orders from drupa will mean better operating results in the second and third quarters than in the first three months
1436192 the trade show enabled us to underline our position as the world leader in the industry but difficult underlying conditions are still impacting on the current market situation the package of measures already introduced to improve our cost structure will compensate these effects in the medium term
1436193 as already indicated weak sales and additional costs led to a negative operating result for the first quarter of the financial year
1436194 we are working hard to ensure successful implementation of the package of cost cutting measures introduced so that the resultant savings can be achieved as planned
1436195 sabemos que china es cada vez m s importante en la vida pol tica econ mica y tambi n en la de las ideas y es importante que este gran continente se abra al evangelio

1436203 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1436204 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1436205 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1436206 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1436207 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 iraq was subject to
1436208 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1436209 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1436210 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1436211 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1436212 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1436213 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1436214 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1436215 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1436216 after being told that habbush had said there were no wmd bush was frustrated
1436217 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help us make our case

1436225 when i was pregnant with my daughter frankie i had all kinds of questions including ones about immunization there is a wealth of misinformation about vaccines out there particularly in hollywood
1436226 my husband and i took the time to speak to several doctors about our concerns what became clear to us was that delaying vaccines could jeopardize our babys life i have teamed up with every child by two to help parents get the facts straight on this very important issue
1436227 my main message to parents is that they should not be taking medical advice from me or any other celebrity they should look to their pediatrician the
1436228 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1436229 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1436230 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1436231 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want

1436233 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1436234 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1436235 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature

1436242 i was in a very serious car accident in december 2002
1436243 because of my brain injury i have a slight limp in my gait its a little off i still walk i still talk too much actually but my personality is not anything like it was before the accident modeling was a dream i had been working toward for so long
1436244 on the one hand the goal of the show is to give the girls taking part a shot in the mainstream industry on the other its to challenge general perceptions of what is and isnt beautiful
1436245 why cant an extremely attractive model in a wheelchair be used to sell the latest prada outfit
1436246 say this person is better than this person because they worked harder to overcome their disability
1436247 i had a cast that went clear past my elbow it held my arm in a certain position and it was very hard to deal with
1436248 at this point people might use a disabled girl for a gimmick they might exploit it i dont think the industry uses disability in a positive way right now but i hope our show will change that
1436249 the girls that we have on this show have all the qualities that a fledging model should have the disabled girls dont have a problem with their disability its the industry that has the problem accepting them
1436250 if it allows people to see disabled people in a different light than they normally would i fully applaud that
1436251 thats something tyra banks and i have always tried to do
1436252 its easier to accommodate the problems of our girls than the problems of a spoiled teenage model making vast amounts of money with no value for it
1436253 if you dont want to show someone with a missing arm you just put her in a different position
1436254 mostly be seen in the public using their wheelchairs or scooters
1436255 otherwise youve got women who are in their wheelchairs all the time and they get offended if they see someone standing up we cant have title holders out there walking when theyre seen in the public
1436256 we were expecting the prime minister of canada to do the right thing the right thing was like the chinese head tax
1436257 our community is very much disappointed we have been treated like a second class citizen
1436258 not even one caller came in favour of the apology
1436259 jason kenney personally declared on behalf on the canadian government that they were going to address this in parliament
1436260 now the community feels like its 1914 on the boat all over again
1436261 we chose the date because eight has always been our lucky number
1436262 i like the way it looks that its continuous said ebert a home depot cashier
1436263 we waited until 2008 because i like eight otherwise we would have gotten married earlier
1436264 this is a growing business with excellent prospects for success
1436265 as the owner and operator of some of the countrys leading sports and entertainment websites were excited about bringing a unique experience to our digital audiences
1436266 canadians will soon have access to the latest and most innovative commission style fantasy sports pools when they visit sites such as sportsnet ca and fan590 com
1436267 giving oil companies additional access to oil resources doesnt make sense for america in fact it makes about as much sense as his proposal to build 45 new nuclear reactors without a plan to store the waste some place other than right here at yucca mountain folks these are not serious energy policies
1436268 highly radioactive materials produced as a byproduct of the reactions that occur inside nuclear reactors
1436269 the lord is my light and my salvation whom shall i fear the lord is the stronghold of my life of whom shall i be afraid
1436270 there is no medical evidence on record to say that the child will be handicapped after birth
1436271 the petitioners have not made out that this ladys case is exceptional for us to use discretionary powers
1436272 the court has opined that the medical expert body which was directed to submit a report has submitted that the child will not be a permanent disabled as contemplated
1436273 today the two people who began this controversy are no longer a part of our government but the spotlight on the political theater created is still just as bright as the investigations are wrapping up and as the investigation of the investigations continues
1436274 thousands of hours have been expended over the past year to uncover that no laws were broken and that politicians will always attempt to undermine their political enemies

1436277 soaring price of oil will leave the iraqi government with a cumulative budget surplus of responded angrily to the news noting that the u s government has
1436278 i have ever thought no bereavement was equal to that of a husbands or a wifes but i feel it difficult to believe that any can be greater or any ones sorrow greater than mine
1436279 now the vatican nervous that this joint burial might raise questions about newman and always eager to insist that gay men even celibate ones cannot be saints any more than they can now be seminarians is actually exhuming newmans body and reburying it sans st john reburying saints is not unknown but violating such a core last wish of this great man is definitely suspicious they could exhume st john too and re bury both together respecting their clear wishes but that would be off message for the now pathologically homophobic vatican
1436280 oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive
1436281 instant messaging is a great way to stay in touch but anybody who uses it extensively knows the pain of having friends spread out over different services ever install a bulky and bloated im client for just one friend or wished you could instant message all your groupies without running 5 different chat clients in the system tray well im providers and a handful of crafty open source programmers have listened to our cries free browser based alternatives exist for all the major platforms and all in one desktop clients are finally able to bring the competing services together

1436290 here in north idaho i did a double take when i saw this seriously downsized motorcycle in a grocery store parking lot odds are its not headed to sturgis this week

1436292 i feel like god is standing at my door knocking as though he wants to come in and be with me it seems like all i need to do is let him in but i dont know if im ready
1436293 laura what would you do if i believed in jesus
1436294 we need to talk its come to our attention that on your loan application you either lied or made some huge omissions youve violated your contract with the bank on several counts the deal is off

1436296 be god to you and to your descendants after you
1436297 remembered his covenant with abraham with isaac and with jacob
1436298 i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt
1436299 because i am the lord your god who brought you out of egypt you shall have no other gods before me
1436300 all that the lord has spoken we will do and we will be obedient
1436301 when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel and with the house of judah not like the covenant which i made with their fathers in the day i took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of egypt my covenant which they broke although i was a husband to them
1436302 but this is the covenant which i will make with the house of israel after those days i will put my law within them and on their heart i will write it and i will be their god and they shall be my people for i will forgive their iniquity and their sin i will remember no more
1436303 i will be your god and you will be my people
1436304 you shall love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might
1436305 love the lord your god and always keep his commandments
1436306 this is my body which is given for you do this in remembrance of me
1436307 this cup which is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood
1436308 look you know what you messed up but the bank has thought it over and has decided to hold up its end of the bargain so go ahead lets sign the papers and you can have the house
1436309 the great civilizations throughout history the greeks persians babylonians and romans all exist today as only an archaeological relic yet the jewish people even in the face of incredible persecution and exile to the four corners of the world thrive and flourish to this day
1436310 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1436311 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1436312 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable
1436313 we need to be able to address a national energy strategy and then try to work on environmental efficiencies as part of that plan
1436314 we cant just start with things like emission standards at a time when were at a crisis with the entire national energy policy
1436315 there was not enough emphasis that if we move aggressively toward sustainable energy we will transform our energy costs
1436316 we were not as clear as we might have been
1436317 state sanctioned murder of a civilian without evidence of any crime but justified on the basis of being a terrorist is a form of terrorism itself
1436318 were still growing were still going to get better as each game goes on but i think tonight we learned something
1436319 the last two games the ball has been sticking a little bit so we have to get back to looking like the first game where everybody was touching the ball and we were playing like we should
1436320 were too talented of a team to take tough shots because theres always going to be someone open
1436321 in the third quarter they knocked down some big shots and i think that got them back in the ball game
1436322 and for us we have to understand that thats going to happen from time to time and its important to keep our poise keep our composure and buckle down
1436323 we just broke down we gambled a couple of times and allowed them to make the extra pass
1436324 we cant have those types of mental breakdowns because these teams can really shoot the ball
1436325 what theyve done and where you see them can intimidate a lot of people
1436326 i think to come into a game intimidated youve given up before you start and we didnt feel like we did that tonight
1436327 we arrive at the view that given the current state of the credit markets and 1 7 billion in maturities cablevision faces next year the companys options are fairly limited
1436328 we believe the company could institute a regular dividend on the order of 1 per share
1436329 the boards action is against the interests of the nation and risks the safety of thousands of american traveling and living abroad
1436330 we must now rely on the u s supreme court to prevent texas from breaking a commitment made by the president and senate on behalf of the country as a whole
1436331 mr medellin raised that issue before the trial in pre trial he didnt raise the issue and he didnt raise the issue during the trial
1436332 if he had raised the issue at his probable cause hearing the court would have complied and it was never raised
1436333 they dont care about jennifer they dont care about elizabeth
1436334 theres no question that senator obama wins the likability contest
1436335 oh i went out on the streets and saw the energy out there
1436336 well im behind now but in two or three years ill be ahead
1436337 not a single vote for those who arent in the unity camp
1436338 lasted approximately four and a half hours including recovery and he is in good spirits and was visiting family members this morning
1436339 he was walking this morning and is looking forward to his release as soon as possible
1436340 was more concerned about the people around him than himself
1436341 mr freeman thought he may have gone to sleep but he wasnt sure
1436342 the car was bent on the front as well as rear i mean severely
1436343 it was so bad i couldnt tell what it was
1436344 watching television about 11 15 and i heard a car sliding on the highway out in front of our house
1436345 as i looked out the window i saw it began to flip after it hit our next door neighbors drive it went end over end about twice and then it came back on its wheels in the ditch it was a mess
1436346 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered
1436347 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1436348 these are two places we have always wanted to go
1436349 earlier this year we went to indonesia malaysia and alaska for the first time we want to go and play anywhere people want to hear us
1436350 i think life is a journey i have a map and a hazy itinerary but i am not afraid to change the route
1436351 like the guys who get together for coffee at a local shop in the morning around a table or at a counter and every one has an opinion about something and the current events is usually the subject now take that table and expand it as far as your mind can think
1436352 when it gets to this point in situations like these i think mosquitoes are coming for me
1436353 life has no meaning the only meaning it has is what we ourselves give it and sadly we often forget we are the ones who gave it the meaning
1436354 man has a deep need to worship and if he doesnt worship the true and living god he ends up worshipping false gods that are merely projections of himself
1436355 an intellectual construction which solves all the problems of our existence uniformly on the basis of one overriding hypothesis which accordingly leaves no question unanswered and in which everything that interests us finds its fixed place
1436356 the possession of a weltanschauung of this kind is among the ideal wishes of human beings believing in it one can feel secure in life one can know what to strive for and how one can deal most expediently with ones emotions and interests
1436357 if you put an object on a table and then remove the table and the object stays there held by a hidden wire babies are surprised they expect the object to fall and contrary to what is still being taught in some psychology classes they understand that objects persist over time even when hidden
1436358 before they are a year old they the babies can determine the target of an adults gaze and can learn by attending to the emotions of others if a baby is crawling toward an area that might be dangerous and an adult makes a horrified or disgusted face the baby usually knows enough to stay away
1436359 understanding of the physical world and understanding of the social world can be seen as akin to two distinct computers in a babys brain running separate programs and performing separate tasks the understandings develop at different rates the social one emerges somewhat later than the physical one
1436360 in the most extreme cases children with autism see people as nothing more than objects objects that move in unpredictable ways and make unexpected noises and are therefore frightening
1436361 they the computers evolved at different points in our prehistory our physical understanding is shared by many species whereas our social understanding is a relatively recent adaptation and in some regards might be uniquely human
1436362 comfortable with religion as a source of spirituality and transcendence tolerance and love charity and good works
1436363 uncomfortable however with religion when it makes claims about the natural world let alone a world beyond nature
1436364 science gets the realm of facts religion the realm of values
1436365 in the beginning god created the heavens and the earth
1436366 and all that night the lord drove the sea back with a strong east wind and turned it into dry land
1436367 96 percent of people in the united states believe in god well over half of americans believe in miracles the devil and angels most believe in an afterlife most americans say they believe that after death they will actually reunite with relatives and get to meet god
1436368 the rest of the world asia africa the middle east is not exactly filled with hardcore atheists
1436369 most polls from european countries show that a majority of their people are believers
1436370 a real biblical god one believers could pray to and actually get answers from only the most elite scientists members of the national academy of sciences have a strong majority of atheists and agnostics
1436371 embarrassment for those who see supernatural beliefs as a cultural anachronism soon to be eroded by scientific discoveries and the spread of cosmopolitan values
1436372 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and i will give you rest
1436373 whoever serves me must follow me and where i am my servant also will be my father will honor the one who serves me
1436374 view that religion emerged not to serve a purpose not as an opiate or a social glue but by accident it is a byproduct of biological adaptations gone awry
1436375 todos estos elementos han hecho que tomemos la decisi n que el pdm del 2003 2007 pase a una reajuste y enriquecimiento para convertirse en 2003 2009 lo que nos permitir trabajar con los nuevos resultados y ampliar el nuevo plan de desarrollo mayor a cinco a os
1436376 for almost twenty centuries the church was the archenemy of the jews our most powerful and relentless oppressor and the worlds greatest force for the dissemination of anti semitic beliefs and the instigation of the acts of hatred many of the same people who operated the gas chambers worshiped in christian churches on sunday the question of the complicity of the church in the murder of the jews is a living one we must understand the truths of our history
1436377 today i believe that i am acting in accordance with the will of the almighty creator by defending myself against the jew
1436378 the candle of the lord set up by himself in mens minds
1436379 belief in god and in personal immortality are not necessarily a part of religion one can conceive of religion without god and it would be pure contemplation of the universe
1436380 hitler often visited the nietzsche museum in weimar and published his veneration for the philosopher by posing for photographs of himself staring in rapture at the bust of the great man
1436381 old testament new hatreds the hebrew bible and anti semitism in nazi germany
1436382 did you hear the one about the goldsteins they are
1436383 what is it with you why do all your jokes have to be jewish with jewish names and all cant you just tell me the joke without the jewish names
1436384 so mr and mrs obrien are going to their sons bar mitzvah
1436385 comedy especially standup is to jews what jazz is to african americans an art form whose vocabulary and attitude they invented and that continues to bear their stamp even when performed by others
1436386 no clothes no shelter and only an apple to eat and they are told this is paradise they are russian jews
1436387 in some ways has come to replace the standard sacred texts as a touchstone for the entire jewish community
1436388 oh well at least weve got our sense of humor
1436389 what makes a joke jewish obviously it must apply to jews but more significantly it must express a jewish sensibility
1436390 jewish sensibility however concerns precisely those subjects and values that receive disproportionate attention among jews anti semitism financial success verbal aggression and assimilation are all particularly significant in jewish life
1436391 the main characteristic of jewish humor is the irony that measures the distance between pretense wishful thinking and reality the result being self criticism and self mockery
1436392 i do not know whether there are many other instances of a people making fun to such a degree of its own character
1436393 but for 25 you are allowed to print six words
1436394 the narrator recognizes himself for what he is a simple human being subject to all the foibles of mortal mind and frailties of the flesh and because he has the moral and intellectual courage to recognize and then ridicule his own weaknesses he sees no reason to spare the sensibilities of his adversaries for their own deficiencies
1436395 the group also debated just how it was that jews became funny the ability to laugh at suffering was offered as a possible reason although murray horowitz pointed out that suffering alone doesnt necessarily lead to humor theres not a lot of armenian comedians he offered as evidence
1436396 my jewish friends we have three days to learn to breathe underwater
1436397 there was nothing jolly and hilarious about the destitution that lay like a curse on millions of jews in the yiddish speaking world they were miserable and knew it but the question that haunts us historically is why did they not disintegrate intellectually and morally how were they able under hideous oppression to keep alive against a better day the spirit originally breathed into man the answer lies in the self mockery by which they rose above their condition to see afar off the hope of the future
1436398 if it is to be it is up to me
1436399 lord i know we are the chosen people but once in awhile couldnt you choose somebody else
1436400 by giving god a sense of humor these jokes make him or her seem more human and with shortcomings this makes them feel that there is perhaps a way of getting closer to god
1436401 can a mother forget the baby at her breast and have no compassion on the child she has borne though she may forget i will not forget you see i have inscribed you on the palms of my hands your walls are continually before me
1436402 the jew ought hardly to be heard of but he is heard of has always been heard of other peoples have sprung up and held their torch high for a time but it burned out and they sit in twilight now or have vanished the jew saw them all beat them all and is now what he always was exhibiting no decadence no infirmities of age no weakening of his parts no slowing of his energies no dulling of his alert and aggressive mind what is the secret of his immortality
1436403 the distressed optimist strikes the right chord in much jewish humor by insisting that the world is moving toward perfection and that the messianic days lie in the future judaism encourages jews to be optimists but jewish history with its tragic record of crusades expulsions pogroms and the holocaust impels jews to pessimism hence as jews we are optimists with worried looks on our faces
1436404 no not at all they just let me sit here on this bench once in a while someone gives me a little food
1436405 that must be hard but even if they dont pay you they must honor you for doing this important work
1436406 i dont understand they dont pay you they dont respect you you sit in the cold shivering and hungry what kind of job is this
1436407 for i know the thoughts that i think toward you says the lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you a future and a hope
1436408 laugh and about 0016 of the world laughs with you
1436409 the argument in effect is that jews reject jesus because they are already jews and the mark of being a jew is that one rejects jesus
1436410 i hope that my book will remind believing christians of the most important thing we have in common a belief that there is such a thing as religious truth in the first place
1436411 the people were amazed at his teaching because he taught them as one who had authority not as the teachers of the law
1436412 you have heard that it was said but i tell you
1436413 those who are well have no need of a physician but those who are sick
1436414 is this hear o israel the lord our god the lord is one love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength the second is this love your neighbor as yourself there is no commandment greater than these
1436415 you are right in saying that god is one and there is no other but him to love him with all your heart with all your understanding and with all your strength and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices
1436416 pharisaic doctrines have more in common with those of christianity than is supposed
1436417 leave this place and go somewhere else herod wants to kill you
1436418 truly truly i say to you before abraham was born i am
1436419 about three thousand were added to their number that day
1436420 the number of disciples in jerusalem increased rapidly and a large number of priests became obedient to the faith
1436421 i am the way the truth and the life no one comes to the father but by me
1436422 for the early christians as for christians today the person of jesus christ was revelatory also of the history and sacred writings of israel of which he is the fulfillment
1436423 but if it is from god you will only find yourselves fighting against god
1436424 a man of the pharisees a member of the jewish ruling council
1436425 unless a man is born again he cannot see the kingdom of god
1436426 does our law condemn a man without first hearing him to find out what he is doing
1436427 a prominent member of the council the sanhedrin who was himself waiting for the kingdom of god
1436428 but many who heard the message believed and the number of men grew to about five thousand
1436429 whats this charleys newsstand gone could charley have died so suddenly and not even a word of warning but whats this why it looks like some kind of hole an entrance of some sort
1436430 what is this place who are you how do you know my name
1436431 im afraid that we only have a couple of rope ladders to climb theyre perfectly safe i assure you the angels have been using them for a long long time and theyre none the worse for wear come on
1436432 you climb this strand and ill go up the other
1436433 the older i got the more i saw there was something profoundly jewish about superman that he was one of us like clark kent weve been diaspora jews for so long being viewed as timid and bookish when underneath there are fierce hebrew warriors doing gods work
1436434 no youre not crazy mr gold you were one of the ones
1436435 every few years a customer comes along when the door to the ladder is open see
1436436 do you mean to say that you know about where ive just been why i cant even tell how long i was there
1436437 i dont just know about it let me tell you ive been there and back many times so have a lot of my customers but some of them never come back herbie fein now he went there about twenty years ago and he got off the ladder right at the breaking of the vessels wanted a closer look at the sparks stayed there the rest of his life mrs fein never knew what happened to him but you
1436438 you came back maybe you learned something thats what they say youre supposed to learn something you might not even know what it is but they say it can take time
1436439 the last thing that happened the man at the top of the ladder
1436440 yeah yeah that one did you get a good look at him
1436441 i didnt recognize him if thats what you mean he was wearing a tallis but i think he had been attacked maybe in a pogrom he was all black and blue a bloody mess
1436442 yes he was a bloody mess all right did you see where he was bleeding from

1436518 like the pensacola bay area housing market itself randy phillips and his wife heather hood have found themselves with too many homes and not enough buyers they have a house in north hill they cant sell a mortgage to pay on their home in east hill and another mortgage on their former home in orange beach ala
1436519 we hate to do it but were now thinking about putting the house in east hill on the market randy phillips said
1436520 they purchased their north hill home in 2004 just before hurricane ivan hit the storm took the roof off and we never spent a night in it phillips said
1436521 but they did spend a year and 50 000 repairing it only to decide it was too small for them they then bought their current home in east hill and in mid 2006 put their north hill home on the market for 259 000 thinking it would sell quickly
1436522 as soon as we bought the house in east hill the market turned phillips said
1436523 with so many houses for sale phillips and hood turned to the rental market for relief they managed to attract someone looking for an 18 month lease but the deal fell through and they were forced to put the house back on the market
1436524 several subsequent price cuts have pushed the asking price down to 199 999 more than 15 000 below what they paid for the house in 2004 burdened with three mortgages randy phillips says something has got to give
1436525 bill and teresa preston have had their 5 600 square foot home near bayview park on the market for the past two years with an original asking price of 895 000 while bill preston acknowledges that the original price may have been set too high it has since been dropped to 689 500
1436526 a few perspective buyers have looked at the house but so far no takers
1436527 i guess im luckier than most because im not desperate to sell said preston
1436528 i dont know exactly what the bankruptcy filing means for wcis future said perdido key realtor brenda beumer
1436529 wcis miami dade county developments include one bal harbour and miami beachs mosaic luxury condos priced from 1 1 million and 2 5 million respectively its website shows in broward its building homes in the parkland golf and country club and heron bay in coral springs
1436530 in a sign of just how challenging the real estate business has been for wci it reported 84 new condo orders but 174 cancellations or defaults in the second quarter a hundred of the defaults happened at one project pompano beachs the plaza at oceanside condominium the company disclosed last week
1436531 when you get more new cancellations than new sales its damn near impossible to continue functioning said jack mccabe a deerfield beach real estate analyst
1436532 locally wci built five condo towers and a carriage home complex in the hammock dunes community of flagler county it still owns more than 40 units in casa bella tuscany and le jardin towers wci also owns a vacant oceanfront lot at 1751 s atlantic ave in daytona beach the company paid 23 million for the 66 of an acre in january 2006
1436533 talk about fire sales laramar group of chicago in july paid about 32 million for the 160 unit oceanview apartments in boca raton the previous sale in 2006 was for nearly twice as much nrw development of miami paid 56 2 million for the apartment complex and planned to convert the 40 year old building into pricey condos
1436534 laramar will run the property as apartments and it plans renovations that include washers and dryers in each unit granite counters in kitchens and new floors rents will range from 1 500 to 3 000 a month
1436535 july was another month of record foreclosures in lee county and very little new construction of single family homes foreclosures are doing what theyre doing but the good news is that people are buying foreclosures so at least there is a demand for these said jeff tumbarello director of the southwest florida real estate investors association which tracks foreclosures
1436536 for every two deeds they take back theyve been selling one tumbarello said
1436537 the gluttony of existing and foreclosed homes on the market isnt doing the construction industry any favors foreclosures are being sold at prices new homes cant compete said jamie pirrello ceo of cape based vision homes usa
1436538 in fort myers beach there were no permits issued this month none last month either and two in july 2007
1436539 people are moving on or moving out of the area fulton said
1436540 the owner of the house on southwest 17th terrace had walked away but the bank had not yet taken ownership of the property
1436541 the problem with the foreclosures is the interim period said tommy lee president of the cape coral association of realtors
1436542 as the minibus swings into the driveway janet kenyon takes one look at the new three bedroom two bath house and lets out a shriek
1436543 kenyon and husband blu head inside to a pleasant surprise aw this is nice she coos stroking the faux granite countertops best of all the price 103 000
1436544 three years ago a house like this might have gone for 250 000 as investors swooped into cape coral and transformed the sleepy waterfront city into one of the countrys hottest real estate markets then demand dried up and by february the cape coral fort myers area had a new distinction no 1 in the nation in foreclosures
1436545 with nearly 11 000 homes in foreclosure 1 in every 31 households it could be two years before all the distressed properties find buyers
1436546 cheaper housing prices than those in the tampa bay area or south florida attracted hordes of speculators
1436547 blu kenyon likes cape corals proximity to interstate 75 and southwest florida international airport but the couple decided not to buy one house in cape coral instead they decided to buy three among them an 1 800 square foot home built two years ago for 314 500 todays price 99 000
1436548 an abandoned boarded up home that sits among the well manicured properties in the lakewood ranch country club is a symbol of one way in which the growing foreclosure crisis is marring some neighborhoods
1436549 the presidio glen home was owned by preston and saralynne slater who own another country club home in the 7400 block of riviera cove the slaters who were reportedly living in the presidio glen home at the time of the fire could not be reached for comment the phone at their riviera cove property has been disconnected
1436550 manatee building department director john barnott said he learned about the unsafe conditions at the home two weeks ago and then began trying to contact the mortgage firm they are a hard bunch to get ahold of he said
1436551 the problem is particularly acute in the sarasota bradenton market where an average of about 2 000 houses a month have gone into foreclosure since the spring
1436552 manatee county officials gave the company until last friday to say how it plans to correct the problems at the residence it was unclear if the company had responded by the end of the day friday
1436553 they are either going to repair it so it can be lived in or they are going to tear it down barnott said
1436554 stressed by increasingly heavy tax and insurance bills and the inability to generate rents to cover these costs some landlords are now walking away from their properties at the same time people who paid more for housing than they could afford during the boom are defaulting on their loans and joining the ranks of renters
1436555 jill lyons a rental specialist in sarasota said homeowners who might have been shelling out as much as 2 300 a month in mortgage payments feel extreme relief after moving into rental property where the rent is only 1 200 a month
1436556 scott corbridge president of sarasota management amp leasing said the supply of homes available to rent has grown this year as investors have given up on trying to sell their properties and are looking for temporary relief by renting them the result is that the additional supply is weighing on rents
1436557 what used to rent for 1 000 is now 800 corbridge said
1436558 the decline in apartment occupancy and rents is a direct result of the collapse of the housing industry in florida and landlords who provide housing at the lowest end of the market have been hit the hardest
1436559 ive got a place in englewood a working class duplex and im not getting any calls at 650 said al holmes president of the sarasota landlords association
1436560 theres a real emphasis on the investment potential said jared beck the condominium lawyer representing taglieri
1436561 dante alexander president of the national association of condo hotel owners estimates there are more than two dozen condo hotel lawsuits under way across the country
1436562 it all started with the change in the residential housing market he said
1436563 u s district judge patricia seitz in miami dismissed 29 lawsuits friday against opera tower near downtown miami stating the contract was explicit about what buyers were getting no matter what a slick advertisement promised
1436564 the brochure showed a 56 story elliptical shaped building on the water with a nearby marina the illustration omitted surrounding high rise buildings the one and two bedroom units were priced from 200 000 to 800 000
1436565 developer tibor hollo said the lawsuits filed against opera tower are from flippers upset with the turn in the housing market
1436566 much of the time miami native kenneth h thomas a nationally known banking expert is traveling often to philadelphia to lecture at the wharton school of the university of pennsylvania where he got his doctorate in finance in a recent interview thomas weighed in on the state of the banking industry and the economy
1436567 q when will the housing market begin to turn around a i dont think the market will improve in terms of normal price appreciation until perhaps two or three years which could be the end of 2010 maybe 2011
1436568 q who is to blame for the current banking woes
1436569 a when we do the postmortem in a few years the way we did with the s amp l crisis im certain well conclude that there were many factors in my belief chief among them will be the fact that former fed chairman alan greenspan kept rates too low for too long and it may very well be he was inordinately influenced by the white house based on my analysis of his very frequent visits there but we dont really know that but i would say the fact is the punch bowl was left out too long
1436570 i coulda been a contender i coulda been somebody instead of a bum
1436571 full many a flower that is born to blush unseen
1436572 it will work if you try will you wait for me
1436573 the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph what we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly it is dearness only that gives everything its value i love the man that can smile in trouble that can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection tis the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death
1436574 so you two want to be investment bankers but what if you could do anything in world what would you do
1436575 you and i have been taught very different american dreams i thought the american dream was that if you work hard enough you can get whatever you want
1436576 we are about to change that dream their next dream will be one of hope there is a future here
1436577 some of our friends get the opportunity to go to school so they find life easy
1436578 but the work i am doing makes it so hard for me to continue
1436579 we want to see our people coming back to our homes so we can resettle
1436580 i know that things will be fine one day one day for our country i know the time will come for us
1436581 weve got all these people all different kinds of ideas
1436582 but they dont have the money to facilitate their ideas
1436583 but the fact that we are here letting the flag fly means there is hope
1436584 aber eine so sch ne blaue farbe sollte meine braut schon haben

1436596 hat sich der ausflug in die stadt wohl doch gelohnt
1436597 aber siehst du denn gar nicht dass ich schon verheiratet bin
1436598 oh diese blumen sind wohl zu viel mit den menschen zusammen leben in kleinen k sten statt in erde und haben von menschen gemachte partner und berhaupt hier duftet es ja gar nicht
1436599 liebe kleine blume ich bin schon lange unterwegs um eine braut zu suchen aber jetzt wei ich dass ich eigentlich nur dich heiraten m chte
1436600 ich habe schon lange auf dich gewartet ich will dich auch gern heiraten
1436601 he proclaims he is a symbol of the possibility of america returning to its best traditions who says that about himself
1436602 to me narcissism is the inability to grasp that anyone else exists except as they relate to the narcissist everyone else should have the narcissists interests at heart should understand the narcissists moods without reacting negatively to them should make the narcissist the center of their universe narcissists are needy people and usually somewhat paranoid if you had a bad day a narcissists was worse if your entire family was dying of cancer dont worry the narcissist has been through a worse emotional turmoil if anything should go wrong its because the narcissists enemies are out to get her they are jealous of her status her beauty her charm her popularity etc

1436633 we were in tampa a couple of years back and it was the night trot nixon got hurt and we had an off day the next day and manny was scheduled to have the day off that night and trot couldnt play
1436634 manny was supposed to have an off day and he was asked to fill in for trot because we had nobody to play and he didnt and we were in the clubhouse and it was david ortiz and manny and i and ino guerrero and the seth mcclung was pitching and he was one of those guys who threw 96 miles per hour and no one could ever figure out why he wasnt better than he was and against us hed always go out the first three innings and look like cy young of course this night hes looking like cy young he punched out five or six guys in the first three innings and david looks at me and says why in the hell does this guy turn into cy young against us and i said hey it just makes manny look that much smarter he aint stupid he knows what days to take off and manny took offense to that and there was something that had to be broken up and the next day i saw manny and it was as if the previous day never happened one of the beautiful things about manny
1436635 you kind of hope it didnt happen because it ends up being someone getting what they wanted after doing every possible thing ethically they could do wrong
1436636 i was in that clubhouse after that and the change in atmosphere was palpable and i dont think you can put a price tag on that

1436644 i read your post on how some of the aol weblogs bloggers are blogging for free i dont know who the bloggers are or which blogs within the portfolio this applies to either i was recently hired signed a contract to write for one of the blogs last week the blog im with sent out a note to all the members of the team that everyone except for lead bloggers and paid staff should refrain from posting until august because of a budget shortfall on the blog i was hired to write for we receive just x redacted per post features slideshows and such are paid at a higher rate i think some bloggers continue because they feel a sense of mission and duty and are really into it emphasis added i will not write for free
1436645 no one should be writing for free except for interns and people looking to get a start in the field i have written for huffpo on special occasions but i received press passes that made it worthwhile as well as exposure and clips that showcased a different side to my writing however i cant make a habit out of it because i have to make a living

1436754 we have seen a tremendous change in the market interest in our truck products over the past few months as the price of oil has shown such surprising volatility
1436755 we need to move faster and find ways to encourage all of our partners and suppliers to plan for faster growth as we turn this initial interest into hard orders

1436770 being able to store a configured image of a machine and just click and drag that image into reality is earth shattering deploying virtual sans load balancers and firewalls for pennies on the dollar would give my company a real advantage in our niche
1436771 the line between software and hardware is becoming increasingly blurry companies like mine must leverage these innovations or yield market to those who can
1436772 i think this is a very defining moment right now debt markets are a little thin capital markets are very volatile and so there is opportunity there and we are spending a lot of time making sure we deploy wisely and that we build the right businesses and partner with the right businesses
1436773 we have so many deals on the screen right now that it is very difficult to say from a sequencing perspective what we are going to hit but we are looking quite heavily at the industrial space so heavy industrial type of deals and real estate especially in the united states
1436774 we dont do deals just because they are high profile we do deals because they make sense financially and because they help us in our diversification aim
1436775 i wouldnt discount the fact that you will see what i think the rest of the world will view as high profile deals but we do them because we look at a very particular lens

1436778 where u s vulnerabilities may lie and how the united states should think about maintaining its military advantage in the future
1436779 the roman model suggests that it is possible for the united states to maintain its military advantage for centuries if it remains capable of transforming its forces before an opponent can develop counter capabilities transformation coupled with strong strategic institutions is a powerful combination for an adversary to overcome
1436780 you take apart historical events reassemble them as a simulation and then tinker with the simulation until you can recreate the historical event accurately
1436781 what that allows you to do is play out what if situations what if napoleon did this what if ghengis khan did that
1436782 liked the presentation so much they felt it should be written down
1436783 youll see some neoconservatives at the beginning of the bush administration crowing that we do have an empire lets just come out of the closet and say we do
1436784 but the administration never did that because empire doesnt sell well with the public
1436785 the presumption that the united states should rule the world sword at the ready for the foreseeable future is an unacceptable basis for a just even handed foreign policy
1436786 it is inappropriate to apply modern concepts of systems theory doctrine and strategy to ancient armies that required a level of planning and centralization that simply did not exist
1436787 get warped by the military industrial congressional complex into more money for weapons
1436788 the office of net assessment is doing this to show well gee these other empires transformed themselves they were successful we need to do the same thing
1436789 well thats going to cost big bucks and that will cause economic overstretch people say it cant happen to us since we have such a big economy but every empire has said that
1436790 a whole bunch of copies went out to the government
1436791 an obvious kind of presentism which at its worst becomes indoctrination by historical example
1436792 a successful distillation of relevant information and scholarship complemented by very interesting systematic analysis
1436793 an intense myopic habit of wanting to make the ancient world fit into modern stereotypes
1436794 they got the murderer he is no longer at large
1436795 a new jersey mailbox used to send the anthrax was less than 100 yards away from a sorority for which ivins harbored an intense life long obsession

1436799 borrowed from a bioweapons lab that fall freeze drying equipment that allows scientists to quickly convert wet germ cultures into dry spores
1436800 the drying device known as a lyopholizer could help investigators explain how he might have been able to send letters containing deadly anthrax spores to u s senators and news organizations
1436801 the device was not commonly used by researchers at the armys sprawling biodefense complex at fort detrick md
1436802 if you google lyophilize and anthrax most of the pages returned are about anthrax vaccines which is what dr ivins was working on at ft detrick
1436803 let me reiterate no matter how good the microbial forensics may be they can only at best link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab they cannot link it to any individual
1436804 i dont know whether this is the right person or not
1436805 i dont know if well hear anything from them that will convince me that theyve gotten to the bottom of it
1436806 the fbi apparently applied a lot of pressure to all the investigators there at detrick and they found the weakest link
1436807 if they had real evidence on him why did they not just arrest him
1436808 one of the reasons they need to lay this out is so that the public can be confident that they are protected
1436809 the post office workers the general public the local police they are all owed an explanation they would like to have closure
1436810 all culture is a cover for secretively monstrous behavior particularly the nuclear family
1436811 the whole world is a mess and i just want to rule it
1436812 people who sort of even know me in real life sometimes express disbelief until the people who really do know me confirm to them that its all true people who dont know me at all usually think i make all this crap up the funniest part of this to me is that there is so much that i actually dont write about that is about a hundred times crazier than the stuff i actually do write about if you all only knew thats all i have to say if yall only knew
1436813 decisions decisions just roll the dice fate is going to do with you what she will anyway
1436814 unfettered whining is a banana split for the motherfucking soul
1436815 theres no rule that says you have to be fulfilled doing a particular socially acceptable thing
1436816 its a strange thing to discover when youre an adult that youve been somewhat misadjusted to the world your entire life and didnt know it
1436817 if you can get past the occasional imbecile induced bike folly and the fact that davis seems to perpetually be in the path of some giant bipolar tornado you may come to realize that this city is a great place to live
1436818 i see a bookshelf filled with different books from different authors all acting as portals to different worlds and different times the author may give them birth but its the readers who keep them alive
1436819 some books contain the machinery required to create and sustain universes
1436820 i like writing about characters who are drawn to each other but arent necessarily good for each other nyx walks back into your life and you see everything you love destroyed but some vital piece of you something you cant name something you didnt even know was missing is somehow there again whole full like a missing piece of your heart that chokes you
1436821 i believe that love will find you when youre not looking for it so ive been actively not looking for it for about three years now ill let you know how that works out for me
1436822 i found that writing for me was a thing of the hands hands need to produce art and whether its written or made it feeds the need to produce art
1436823 when somebody loves you they love you for everything you are good bad butch brutal bad bowler and im all of those things and a lot more pretending im not hiding it covering it up pretending that all i want is the garden and the house and not the midnight fucking in marrakech is a lie its gutting half of myself its sacrificing one to get the other i shouldnt have to sacrifice it those parts of myself should make each other stronger gutting one guts the other i cant live a life thats half a person i cant live half a life now how do i get the house and the garden and the fucking in marrakech this is the real question
1436824 love is a choice i fully believe that also i think its controlled by the same part of the brain that makes you actively choose to pretend you dont know how the stove works choose wisely
1436825 a lot of people ask me for advice on writing
1436826 i hope that within these roughly 2 000 pages is a tale about women searching for their place in the world coming to terms with themselves fighting for change accepting their power dealing with issues of friendship family responsibility sexuality and identity struggling with fears and doubts hope and longing oppression and desire i hope and yet it seems as if the prevailing sentiment is the only thing that matters is the man is having a man am i mistaken am i reading this incorrectly im asking
1436827 why does my job exist it exists because i willed it into existence when the day goes badly i can remind myself that i have asked for this job by name and thought to create this for myself and i can only blame myself for the whole thing
1436828 dude i was a nerd from the day i was born i was reading in kindergarten i got humungous glasses that covered half of my face in second grade ive been living the nerd life ever since

1436830 i sometimes think god is a shit and he wouldnt be worth it otherwise hes much more interesting when hes a shit
1436831 sometimes though you dont get to choose what kinda fame youre gonna get or how much itll cost ya
1436832 so heres what i think we need to do if we want to write a sci fi or a fantasy show and give it appeal way beyond the normal boundaries of sci fi fantasy fandom
1436833 personally i believe neither that youre attracting nutty people because you dont want nice ones nor that the universe will deliver someone really neato as soon as you deserve him or her it would be nice if things worked out that equitably for everyone but in my experience the universe is kind of shiftless and lazy and just doesnt bother
1436834 when you are young passion and hope are so strong thats its almost impossible to stop loving someone after youve been kicked around by life however you start to have a dual response to handsome con men wow and arrrrrrgh it takes not will power but painful experience to make us wise
1436835 be of service go where you can help if youre an artist be of service to your art dont have it the other way around you have to put aside your dreams of being a hotshot and learn to be useful you step up everyday get a nice clean hit and youre done
1436836 oh honey you just need to meet the right man
1436837 whenever youre called on to make up your mind and youre hampered by not having any the simplest way to solve the dilemma youll find is simply by flipping a penny no not so that chance shall decide the affair as youre passively standing there moping but as soon as the penny is up in the air youll suddenly know what youre hoping
1436838 im not normal by conventional social standards and ill never be so maybe i should stop worrying and just embrace the insanity a bit
1436839 you are always dreaming every dream you could dream all the time even when youre awake a part of your brain is stirring that brew which one you choose to remember in the morning is based on wishes anxieties its a vast and fascinating place everywhere you turn a part of you

1436841 most women accept the fact that they can be occasionally somewhat crazy i dont know any women who believe they are always handle situations with rational thought they all know they slip off the deep end from time to time it happens but men they really dont get it they really think they are never wrong what they want is whats best why wouldnt it be its what they want why shouldnt they have things their way and its there that lies the problem men are inherently crazy because they dont think theyre crazy at all its the definition of insanity really
1436842 oddly enough she can handle having a lesbian daughter much better than one who is still single at 30

1436874 i think that helps his confidence because hes been wondering whether hes going to be able to hang on here
1436875 now i think he understands the whole picture so we see a better travis wilson

1436885 senator obamas stance on offshore oil drilling has been mischaracterized he has not changed his position he has continually campaigned against additional drilling calling the policy a gimmick saying it was a scheme and ridiculing those who support it with his steadfast opposition to john mccains all of the above approach to our energy crisis americans should know that barack obama remains opposed to additional domestic oil drilling speaker pelosi moveon org and the sierra club can take comfort from the fact that barack obama still opposes additional domestic oil drilling meanwhile the american people can be sure that john mccain will do what is necessary to reduce this countrys dependence on middle east oil and bring down prices at the pump

1436924 ignoring counsels objection mandates automatic reversal of the ensuing conviction
1436925 read together as a whole the testimony of the sergeant the chief investigating officer and the criminalist fail to resolve key foundational issues about the chain of custody who labeled the swabs at the police department who if anyone sealed the swabs at the police department who if anyone segregated the swabs from other evidence at the police department to minimize the possibility of inadvertent substitution of swabs in one case for swabs in another case who if anyone at the police department put the swabs in safe storage to which only authorized persons had access to minimize that possibility did each and every person at the police department who had anything to do with the swabs follow established protocol for the secure transfer of evidence from one person to another within the department and from the department to doj were the swabs if sealed by anyone at the police department still sealed on arrival at doj if so did the criminalist himself break the seals on the swabs he analyzed if not who did did each and every person at doj who had anything to do with the swabs follow established protocol for the secure transfer of evidence from one person to another within doj as to all of that the record is silent
1436926 here the chain of custody amounts to nothing more than a link here a link there with little more than speculation to connect the links into a chain

1436945 i am so pleased with the way the grand opening went
1436946 it was a great success lots of people came through to see the art and express interest in it i think this is going to be a very positive thing for perth
1436947 i know what the artists are going through because ive been there myself as an artist
1436948 i understand the challenges and frustrations artists can face and our goal with this gallery is not only to give artists a place to put their work on display but to support them and give them tools to market themselves as well
1436949 i love small towns and my wife and i really love perth
1436950 we started talking and thought the best thing to do would be to open a gallery first
1436951 i think this is a good place to start and then our other ideas can evolve from this
1436952 i see it being a space where a collective of artists is renting space and doing something unique and wonderful
1436953 right now this project is on the backburner but its going to happen its something were very interested in doing once and gallery takes off
1436954 lanark county has an amazing number of artists creating some really great art
1436955 because of that we greg and i want to give them a place to show their work in a gallery setting our goal is to also help artists promote themselves and their work promotion is something that is very important and valuable to an artist
1436956 lets face it not everyone can afford an original piece of work
1436957 with the online store people can still have a piece of the artists work even if they cant afford an original piece this online store is also a great way for artists to get exposure it will help get their art out there beyond the gallery
1436958 we are interested in fine art and no matter what well always have two and three dimensional art on display here
1436959 well be doing solo shows for artists and rotating exhibits on a regular basis
1436960 the best thing for us is working with artists who are excited about their own work
1436961 when an artist is excited we get excited and it makes supporting and promoting them that much easier were looking for dynamic enthusiastic artists we have a pretty good mix of art in display here and that the way we want to keep it
1436962 i dont make jokes i just watch the government and report the facts
1436963 mm i can feel the energy going down my body
1436964 and its not feasible for the talent in the districts and small towns to come to us we will have to go to them with the game we realised that for the last two three seasons we have been working on that
1436965 told ya u should have played this instead of wasting your time in school
1436966 thats when this huge ball of fire was coming directly at me and there was just no stopping it it was just so fast
1436967 i know im lucky i know it could have been a lot worse i could have been dead or could have hurt somebody or been blind there are so many things that could have happened out of it
1436968 its just constant burn and hurting the bandages are just sticking
1436969 my 6 year old comes in the room and hes scared to come up to me and stuff and i understand
1436970 beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart
1436971 and thou give him nought and he cry unto the lord against thee and it be sin unto thee
1436972 i tell you the truth unless you change and become like little children you will never enter the kingdom of heaven
1436973 and whoever welcomes a little child like this in my name welcomes me
1436974 woe to the world because of the things that cause people to sin such things must come but woe to the man through whom they come
1436975 what do you think if a man owns a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away will he not leave the ninety nine on the hills and go to look for the one that wandered off
1436976 i tell you the truth whatever you bind on earth will be
1436977 lord how many times shall i forgive my brother when he sins against me up to seven times
1436978 i tell you not seven times but seventy seven times
1436979 therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants
1436980 the servant fell on his knees before him be patient with me he begged and i will pay back everything
1436981 but when that servant went out he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii
1436982 his fellow servant fell to his knees and begged him be patient with me and i will pay you back
1436983 but he refused instead he went off and had the man thrown into prison until he could pay the debt
1436984 then the master called the servant in you wicked servant he said i canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to
1436985 this is how my heavenly father will treat each of you unless you forgive your brother from your heart
1436986 it is the view of the association that members need not honour do not call requests that originate from the organization in question
1436987 if youre an exhibitionist go down to english bay and have your rocks off there
1436988 it doesnt belong on the beach which is a family beach and a beach at risk from politicians just because were nude we dont need to add lewd acts
1436989 they feel theyve got people coming into their back yards i dont know what the answer is and i dont worry about it i dont have the energy for it im an open free spirited person and i enjoy life and im going to spend my time at a nude beach and if something happens great
1436990 he set a kinder egg in front of me and said this is the option lets make a movie

1437004 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george coming back tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationary and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals saying you may not like this but here is our next mission and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish ultimately people even talked about it after the fact it was a dark day for the cia it was the kind of thing where they said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forward a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1437005 but dont you think its just hyped because ledger died i know thats not politically correct but come on if he hadnt died there wouldnt have been this much talk about it or this many tickets sold
1437006 im sure hes good but come on an oscar nomination thats so stupid i sure hope they dont do that just because hes dead doesnt mean he deserves an oscar nod and even if he is really good a superhero movie is not oscar material it would just be stupid

1437026 only mom and dad know what will work best for their family so be confident in the choice that you make the best way to deal with people who question your choice is to simply tell them politely but firmly that you have discussed how to feed your baby with your babys doctor feel good about your decision and be confident your baby is getting the essential nutrients he needs
1437027 look ive discussed my decision to terminate this pregnancy with my doctor and she agrees its a good idea healthy for me its the right decision for my family as well im confident in this decision so you need to butt out

1437029 in breastfeeding advocacy we see how much economic self sufficiency makes breastfeeding a difficult practice to sustain for most women 5 this is why in my view the structure of market work is one thing that must change in order to accommodate true maternal freedom which would involve a relatively unconstrained ability to breastfeed ones children

1437033 we thought we would end the series with a light fun romantic comedy that is sure to entertain and delight our audiences
1437034 it has been a hit at festivals around the country and in its over seas release
1437035 ty liebermans script struck me as having the makings of a really fun romantic comedy i immediately loved the premise of the wedding movie with a twist
1437036 the situation in which these characters find themselves was compelling on the verge of marriage our groom must choose between his fianc e and his first love
1437037 i felt there was a delightful paradox in the fact that his first love was a man it is both crucial to the story and yet incidental this could happen to anyone thematically i liked how the screenplay took sexual identity out for a spin
1437038 think my best friends wedding with a sexual twist and you get the picture
1437039 the film is a lot of fun and a lot of laughs and our audience is on the guest list of a very funny wedding

1437047 i was frightened when he was out here with me
1437048 i pumped him to find out who was after him i really believe he didnt know who was after him
1437049 she was sweet outgoing funny she did everything she could to support her children she thought of everybody but herself
1437050 this could be one of our last chances to develop evidence in this case

1437054 they should have gone in the ship locked it down and scoured it for anything hinky related to him he had daily access to sensitive defense information
1437055 it seems like it would have been done a little differently

1437110 senator mccain wants americans to forget that during the republican primary he said that americans were better off than we were eight years ago and that he thinks weve made great progress economically he wants us to forget that hes fully embraced the bush policies he once opposed and bragged about supporting those policies more than 90 percent of time the truth is being a maverick isnt practicing the same kind of politics we have seen from washington for decades it isnt having a campaign run by washington lobbyists and its certainly not promoting the same policies that have led america down the wrong path these past eight years

1437118 this has been a highly charged subject for years not least due to the progressive extension of the scope of the database culminating in recent proposals to include young children who might offend in the future or indeed everyone in the country

1437130 webbs breakthrough ideas show how marketing selling and servicing functions can be approached as a process with input and outputs causes and effects i highly recommend this book to all senior executives whether they are aiming for better forecasting better market share higher margins or reduced cost of sales it will completely change the way you view sales and marketing and help you get a handle on sales process improvement
1437131 hats off to mike webb for tackling this challenging subject improving sales and marketing is like training your cat to come when you call it its an interesting thing to think about but full of pitfalls to the uninitiated mike however is very initiated and this book does a good job of showing you how quantitative methods can apply to a traditionally hard to manage business its not that sales forces dont have metrics you could argue that they have the ultimate metric did we make the sale like your cat these groups seem to have a mind of their own and the cause and effect of the activities that go into making the sale arent usually methodically examined and improved mike shows you how to do that with style
1437132 think about it marketing and sales can easily represent nearly half of your companys annual expenses this expense is far from being optimized when 9 out 10 leads are typically discarded early in the sales cycle companies that do not apply a systematic and truly accountable approach to blending marketing and sales will undoubtedly struggle to survive in this increasingly competitive business climate this book concisely applies practical six sigma methods to help companies boost customer value and realize greater roi out of their marketing and sales investment if you know theres room for improvement between your marketing and sales teams i highly recommend you leverage this book as a key competitive advantage
1437133 this book is essential reading for anyone in sales and marketing mike webbs unique perspective is captured in this excellent roadmap on how to organize measure and lead both marketers and sellers to greater success
1437134 michael webb has once again demonstrated his clear and systematic thinking about delivering value to customers in this must read book sales and marketing the six sigma way in this book mike provides tools to help measure your sales processes in terms important to your customers then you can continuously improve your processes of finding winning and keeping customers
1437135 sales and marketing organizations have historically been slow in adopting the benefits of six sigma for a variety of reasons especially because of the effort required to
1437136 michael webb has a very incisive clear headed approach to untangling complex sales problems sales and marketing the six sigma way breaks the sales funnel into its component parts and systematically identifies bottlenecks and disconnects that waste your time and resources selling might have been done by the seat of the pants in the 20th century but that isnt going to work now those who miss this shift will find themselves further and further behind quotas and locked in a corporate pressure cooker but those who recognize and act will discover that the current business climate can be enormously rewarding and profitable this book is not a sales rah rah session it takes enormously successful methods from manufacturing and applies them to the toughest job in your company getting orders from customers i wholeheartedly recommend michael and his innovative methods
1437137 michael webb brings true understanding to sales and marketing through process thinking if you want a harmonious relationship between sales marketing and customer service that will drive customer value you need to read this book
1437138 if you dont know what you have done to succeed or what has caused you to fail you are leaving your destiny to chance in our experience when you understand and remove obstacles to your customers achieving their objectives you create customer value by helping them succeed in addition putting your own processes under the microscope can reveal the whats inhibiting you from achieving your sales goals michael webbs straightforward approach to sales and marketing using the popular six sigma method is presented with a sense of humor and lots of examples well worth your time
1437139 if more books on the subject were as concise and fun to read as sales and marketing the six sigma way the business world would be a better place the book will provide sales and marketing executives with money making tools they can use daily
1437140 applying six sigma to sales and marketing initially i was skeptical but after reading this book im a believer applying these principles correctly will help sales managers solve many of the challenges they face every day in their quest to improve sales performance
1437141 it isnt often that i can recommend a six sigma book because reducing defects tends to be product focused and internally oriented this book is not only different but better than any other six sigma book ive ever seen because it actually shows how to use it to increase the value of your relationships and experiences with your customers this is the way six sigma should be done
1437142 the name of the game is not to design the sales process around ourselves but to create customer value sales and marketing the six sigma way is relevant to all executives who are looking to deliver maximum results internally and externally
1437143 the residents of eight cities and towns in the county count on us to make a wide range of information available 7x24 and we needed an affordable storage system that could grow with us while providing the highest levels of availability performance and energy efficiency the clariion cx4 storage system brought together all of the features we were looking for into a single system that will support our vmware environment serving more than 24 departments and agencies using a range of applications
1437144 setting the new clariion cx4 system up and managing it was simple and we immediately saw the faster performance which is especially critical for online human services and public safety applications in addition were protecting the taxpayers investment because our clariion cx4 can be easily upgraded to support future technologies that will enable our it organization to continue to offer leading information services to the citizens of our communities
1437145 with this new clariion emc is continuing to press hard to address some of the most crucial cost and management challenges faced by storage and it managers to achieve that the clariion cx4 has technical advances on so many fronts simultaneously that its hard to find much that is missing the clariion cx4s new design and built in features including flash drives are delivered in a highly modular system that can be customized for midrange users precise needs as an incumbent market leader emc faces a bar that continually gets set higher yet the clariion cx4 seems to have cleared the latest height overall this is an extremely well thought out package from emc
1437146 emc is continuing to use its significant resources and talent to incorporate the innovative features that our customers require into a single scalable and easy to use midrange platform we are again pioneering the use of flash drives this time in midrange storage and have designed these systems to take full advantage of server virtualization technology the clariion cx4 series is unmatched in the industry when it comes to scalability features energy efficiency and ease of use with this next generation of systems weve extended our technology leadership and have widened the competitive gap even further
1437147 it appears that mr rushdie might provide some of his own competition with the book he is here to discuss tonight
1437148 had she somehow avoided reading the scores of abysmal reviews she selectively quoted a raving review from
1437149 lost princess and her beloved an italian mercenary who is working as a general of the ottoman army
1437150 much of the weirder stuff in this book is true and the kind of ordinary stuff is the stuff that ive made up
1437151 i discovered to my intense delight that the ottomans were amongst other things fighting a war against dracula i mean actual dracula himself vlad the impaler and the moment i realized that i could have dracula in my novel you know without cheating i thought that id gone to heaven really
1437152 so the book is full of all this absolutely improbable stuff that is in fact in the historical record and all the probably stuff is the stuff that i wrote
1437153 i have this weird moment where i have to ah to see you i have to wear one pair of glasses but to see the book i have to wear a different pair of glasses dons the new spectacles so now youve all disappeared but oh look heres a book let me read to you from it
1437154 a bout of the foulest farting anyone had ever smelled
1437155 martin amis does that martin amis gets up real early he finishes his work by twelve noon and spends the rest of the day playing tennis and drinking and smoking
1437156 i cant write in restaurants you know i have to be at my desk i cant go sit at a caf or under a tree poets do that you know poetry you know where the words dont go all the way across the line and the lines dont go all the way to the bottom of the page and you have sixty pages and you call it a book
1437157 if its like my writing i hate it if its not like my writing i hate it
1437158 well naturally i still have to read what my friends write or they get cross
1437159 i just re read gatsby i hadnt read gatsby since i was 21 and i just couldnt believe how good it was i mean i knew it was good but just what i had forgotten was how extraordinary it is sentence by sentence brilliance it was just absolutely electrifying to read it again really there isnt a bad paragraph
1437160 was terrified to read it again because i assumed it was going to turn out to be garbage but very interestingly it did not
1437161 other kerouac i think is very close to the garbage can
1437162 if you dont have that real thing burning in you that makes it possible to spend twelve years trying to learn to do something without any guarantee that youll ever learn how to do it um then its a problem
1437163 the great writers have always known why they wanted to be a writer theyve always known what was burning inside them that had to get said so if you dont have that fire dont write
1437164 im sorry its brutal but its a real truth there are you know enough books in the world none of us in this room could ever read all the great books that there already are to read if youre going to add to that mountain it better feel necessary to you it better feel like a book that you cant avoid writing and then it has a chance of adding something interesting to the mountain
1437165 i am slightly responsible for the career of zadie smith i have to say i met zadie at my friends house and by the end of the evening it was clear that she was so brilliant and she was like 20 or 19 something pornographic huge laughs and i was so impressed by her that i said what i never say i said if you ever have anything that you want me to read let me see it and what is interesting is she didnt then go home and print out two hundred pages and send them round she waited a year a year later she sent me a hundred pages of an early draft of white teeth and it was just absurdly good i thought god youre now twenty and a half years old i mean i should either kill you or help you and it was close big yuks but in the end i helped her get a literary agent and if i hadnt she would have found one in thirty seconds because the work was so obviously extraordinary and ten seconds after that the agent got her the zillion dollar advance because it was so obvious i mean it was obvious so i guess thats what im saying you know the real writer you can feel that blazing thing inside of them
1437166 so my view is that if you need the advice dont write the book
1437167 im sorry im sorry its tough but i think its true
1437168 sir salman rushdie slams poetry amp kerouac praises zadie smith fitzgerald amp himself

1437201 i dont know of any other security company in westmount
1437202 i want people to come in here and ask me questions even if they dont engage our services i can still offer a lot of advice and expertise
1437203 i always wanted to use the experience that i had i had an idea when i was going to retire so i was sort of focussing on my retirement and pre planning the security business i started it a few years ago but it was very low profile i had the weekends and the evenings but thats not really conducive to running a business i was building a clientele base then when i retired in 2007 i started building up the business
1437204 were very diversified since we started weve come to realise that some of our clients require up to five services per building weve expanded accordingly weve branched off into doorman services we do valet we do garage attendant services we do refuse compacting we provide commercial residential and industrial security plus i do all special events weddings bar mitzvahs bat mitzvahs all different types thats really what i enjoy
1437205 ideally they have both practical experience and theoretical understanding and then we give them on the job training so they can live up to our expectations since were small and we pride ourselves on that we ensure that we recruit the expertise to meet our clients needs
1437206 a major difference with our company is that its owner operated because its owner operated my partner and myself visit events to see exactly what the scenario is and what challenges there are going to be and if there are any what were going to do we make sure our officers are supervised but we do our own supervision which is extremely important if i as an owner am on site and see that one of our employees is conducting himself in an inappropriate way im going to make sure thats corrected i want the repeat business

1437321 todav a hemos visto estos d as al anterior ministro de justicia hablando de construir nuevas imputaciones para que de juana siguiera en la c rcel pero eso es hacer un flaco favor a la democracia y al estado de derecho
1437322 la democracia y el estado de derecho como m s se fortalecen es con la aplicaci n escrupulosa y rigurosa de la ley y de la normativa vigente en cada momento
1437323 si de juana sigue siendo un terrorista no arrepentido su lugar natural sigue siendo la c rcel

1437358 but i cant go out to dinner or to the mall or anything like that
1437359 its been tough one of the toughest things ive ever had to go through
1437360 theres a perception out there i have a problem theres a perception out there that i have two duis theres a perception out there that there is this wild guy driving around seattle drunk
1437361 but i have no one to blame but myself for that
1437362 pretty much the writing is on that wall that its going to be that way its kind of like three strikes and youre out
1437363 i really dont but like i said you never know i wanted to get professionals to see
1437364 its a long training camp theres days where you dont want to go but its when you reach those days you have to push through and keep competing keep pushing through that stuff
1437365 i never tried to doubt myself at all i just kept those blinders on and i had set goals for myself and didnt really get distracted by anything else and kept working toward those goals
1437366 being on the practice squad you go against the first team defense every week and jordan kent and i took advantage of that we had a great practice squad and it helped me understand the game
1437367 going against trufant every day on the practice squad everything has to be perfect
1437368 the test for logan and for any of the young receivers is that when you get into games will they disappear

1437371 when i met billy and you get to talk to him for a little bit its easy to see why hes been successful
1437372 what theyve asked us is not worry about what weve done in the past worry about what were going to do this year
1437373 when youre hauling 300 pounds up that that is difficult
1437374 the players went out before the games to make the field after the game we had to put green paint over the white lines because theyd have another game

1437377 hes very raw behind in experience hes an extra bonus spot his reps will be very very limited
1437378 having him here may not affect the nfl this generation but in the next generation he may go home and spread the nfl game there
1437379 its much like the globalization of basketball that has already happened
1437380 my thing is this is such a detailed oriented game if you can put an investment into yourself and it makes it 1 percent better thats pretty significant where the competition is so close
1437381 if it makes you perform like that on sunday you bet ill take two
1437382 thats new stuff for me but if they believe in it and it works for them and their minds telling their body its working why not plus they all make a lot of money so they can probably afford all those little doodads
1437383 ok theres some stuff that is sort of out there that can really help things that you dont really have an answer for

1437387 if psychologically patrick kerney thinks that by having one of these he will bring down 15 more running backs next weekend thats great for him i have no problem with that
1437388 the problem is people read this and think its a true medical solution

1437402 thanks to twitter sms and mobile web a lot of people are using the url minimizers like tinyurl com urltea com however now i see a lot of people using it on their regular webpages this could be a big problem if billions of different links are unreachable at a given time what if a service starts sending a pop up ad along with the redirect what if the masked target links to a page with an exploit instead of linking to the new photos of jessica alba are services like tinyurl urltea etc taking the www towards a single point of failure is it a huge step backward or im just crying wolf here
1437403 according to the a list strategy gurus such as harvards michael porter my biggest challenge is gaining access to major enterprise customers who will stretch and improve me and my product or service and you know what porter is absolutely right
1437404 thats easy its keeping my products and services ahead of the competition and avoiding the
1437405 the biggest challenge for us is developing our regional economy by joining the dots between the small indigenous local companies and global enterprises the era of a big player locating here and bringing 10 000 jobs has gone we must find a way to create these jobs through our local companies competing and winning in the global market with global customers

1437420 i was hoping to see some classic greenspan syntax multiple semi colons in the same sentence and his trademark obscure phrasing but instead we get a sensible straight forward piece on the implications of the debt crisis
1437421 this crisis is different a once or twice a century event deeply rooted in fears of insolvency of major financial institutions
1437422 regulation the alleged effective solution to todays crisis has never been able to eliminate historys crises
1437423 i really dont understand why greenspan would risk sullying his reputation for obfuscating financial issues by writing something so cogent
1437424 a financial crisis is heralded in fact defined by sharp discontinuities of asset prices
1437425 the fact that risk was heavily underpriced for much of this decade was broadly recognized in the financial community but the timing of the sharp price correction was nonetheless a surprise
1437426 a sustained level of global equity prices will be critical if banks are to recapitalize themselves at the higher levels daunted investors now require

1437428 capital gains cannot finance new physical investment but do add to global net worth
1437429 debt issuance would also be suppressed as it leverages off the level of equity
1437430 investors are growing wary of bonds backed by credit card payments jamming up another debt market and making it tougher for americans to tap what has been one of the easiest places to get credit
1437431 it raises the borrowing costs for these companies translating into higher rates for consumers it also forces the companies to keep more loans on their balance sheets thus locking up funds they could have extended to credit card users
1437432 fast forward a few years and a dramatic mood swing has swept across the social landscape unbridled boosterism and unabashed triumphalism has supplanted despair about the present and pessmisim about the future to many commentators it was as if a prolonged blinding blizzard had ended the storm clouds were breaking up the sun was shining once again and people were emerging from their homes to survey the damage and make repairs the rush was on to declare new york city back on its feet alive and kicking revitalized and reinvigorated
1437433 jerome holtzman was not only my friend but as good and advisor as ive ever had
1437434 for instance after the tie of the all star game in milwaukee the next morning he came to see me and he said i know youre all shook up and these guys are writing and acting like its unprecedented
1437435 he served the sport and all of us in a way that i cant think of anybody else who couldve done that knowledge personality great temperament and tonight particularly to his wife marilyn and to the family i want to thank you because he was a treasure
1437436 i didnt meet him until 1981 when eddie einhorn and i bought the white sox and jerome called us and wanted to get together
1437437 but as bud said his knowledge of the history of the game was unbelievable hed write a column that was so clear and so concise about some historical thing and id ask him how long did it take you to research his and he said i didnt have to research it i already knew it it was just amazing he really was one of a kind and were all going to miss him i know im going to miss him and every time i light up a cigar im going to think about him
1437438 within tribune tower jerome had another legacy and that was a great hole that was left when he departed us
1437439 i went through time and time again these october sessions and the comments were made among the veteran folks on the publishing side theres no personality at the newspaper were missing something in the sports section where is the next jerome holtzman
1437440 for me not knowing him well it became like the samuel beckett play waiting for godot and as i left the tribune last year i can tell you at the last session the same comment was made from all the previous years where is the next jerome holtzman id say at least in the newspaper business or the next great medium that follows it at least here in chicago for as long as all of the people who read jerome for those many years the same question will be asked of us where is the next jerome holtzman
1437441 i remember covering one of the early labor disputes in baseball and jerome knowing as much about the intricacies and legalities of the situation as any of the participants and negotiators
1437442 we all know how in the press box hed hum and smoke his cigar while typing a story sitting next to him i just took that as a challenge to focus harder while i was writing periodically waving the cigar smoke away from my laptop screen so i could see what was there
1437443 i loved how he handled the acerbic george bell the toronto outfielder
1437444 i remember one day during the playoffs when he hurried from the minnesota dugout to the tigers bench where the manager sparky anderson had just finished talking to a group of departing reporters he spotted jerome and acknowledged his old friend jerome said sparky im on deadline just give me your a material and naturally jerome got it
1437445 in one of his first columns i edited i asked him the name of an anonymous source
1437446 then there was the day when i said jerry the best item in your notebook column is your third item why dont we make that the lead jerry agreed its the best item definitely then he calmly said you cant always put the best item first because you want readers to know that they have to read the whole column every time they pick it up it is said that one of the great joys of life is the destination but really its the journey and the people you meet along the way thanks jerry i will always cheer for you
1437447 he had such an easy style in that way he wrote
1437448 i called jerome at home and said do you have the number for marvin miller he said yeah and right off the top of his head he gave me the number i got miller all because i had the easy button it went on like that for three more calls all because i hit the easy button we dont have that easy button any more i think jerome just got tired of the whole thing and probably took it with him so i miss you jerome thank you very much and god bless you
1437449 as a wet behind the ears reporter many years ago i was introduced to the art of baseball writing by one jerome holtzman in a rather rude way
1437450 nearly 30 years later when troy percival shunned the cubs for the tigers i wrote a lead with jerome in mind on purpose which read as the lobster bisque was being served troy percival shunned the cubs
1437451 one valuable lesson he taught all of us maybe without knowing it was he always insisted that the best job at any paper was baseball writer
1437452 and so in remembrance to jeromes most famous book no cheering in the press box may i suggest that every baseball writer stand up and cheer the next time he or she is in the press box as a salute to our hall of fame dean a doff of the chapeau jerome and godspeed i know you arrived in good time someone upstairs is enjoying an eternitys worth of stories
1437453 dick dozer worked for the tribune jerome for the sun times and myself for the chicago daily news and warren brown was a columnist for the chicago american
1437454 i remember one time we were together and after spring training the teams would play some exhibition games in some of the minor league towns in the south
1437455 we always had a lot of laughs and i miss jerry myself and i love him like a brother
1437456 ive known jerome since 87 when i started covering baseball part time
1437457 the players were all back and jerome came a couple days later and as soon as he came out onto the field there was ozzie guillen frank thomas lance johnson alex fernandez robin ventura tim raines just the whole team lined up to shake jeromes hand to welcome him back and tell him how much they missed him and appreciated him i thought to myself for these guys to have that much respect for a guy that really wasnt on their side during the strike it just spoke volumes about the man and what he meant to them and what he meant to baseball to me his legacy as a writer an author a great human being is that he did it the right way and there are too few writers and broadcasters that do it that way anymore
1437458 i want to tell you that being jerome holtzmans son was much different than youd imagine
1437459 i cant tell you why but dad didnt really bring sports to the dinner table
1437460 i have to tell you in a funny way my father prepared me for his death
1437461 what are your plans for reducing the incidence of means testing in the benefit system with particular reference to the impact on incentives to save
1437462 is there a place for frank field in your ministerial team come a tory government
1437463 what are you going to do about the fact that those of us in the private sector have to pay more for public sector pensions than we do for our own
1437464 over the course of a first term tory administration say 4 years what would you project are the potential costs savings and numbers of people moved off the invalidity benefit roll likely to be if there is a net saving will this be applied to further welfare schemes projects or sunk in the general treasury pot
1437465 it is never too late to become the person you could have been
1437466 mccain made signifciant gains at obamas expense among some of what had been obamas strongest demographic groups
1437467 the survey results come as obama fresh off what had been characterized as a triumphant tour of the middle east and europe including a speech to 200 000 germans in berlin that trip quickly became fodder for an aggressive response ad by the mccain campaign that questioned whether obamas popularity around the world meant he was ready to lead the u s
1437468 the mccain camp seems to have turned lemons into lemonade huge crowds and mostly favorable press reviews of obamas overseas trip have been trumped by mccains attacks on obama loss of support for obama among young voters may also be due to his perceived reversals on issues they care about such as the war and government eavesdropping
1437469 if you spend 40 wk on groceries how much do you think a family of 8 should spend
1437470 i will tell you how to get rid of rats
1437471 dig a hole just big enough for a large aluminium pot bury the pot with its mouth barely showing outside the ground in the evening leave a piece of onakka meen dried fish inside at night he will come out of his hole sniffing left and right
1437472 he would soon find the onakka meen and go into the pot to take it if the pot is big enough he will not be able to climb out
1437473 take the pot out in the morning and leave it in the sun
1437474 now he will go tell all the rats in town trust me dont even go near that house

1437484 i think the reality now is there are several sub cycles
1437485 its hard now to talk about the cycle i think we have to talk about all of the cycles
1437486 the way we think about it at thq is we plan our business around each of those platforms not around the cycle
1437487 look look i will go create a universe where the beings inside are irreversibly and cyclically trapped in their own misery which arises from their own happiness hic where they thirst for more more and even more and when they get them they shall never think its enough

1437491 were a very diverse community and we are trying to bridge that gap its nice to have events throughout the year where we can join together national night out presents to us a wonderful opportunity to do that
1437492 the more we grow the more challenging it is for us to touch each and every neighborhood event but were committed to doing that to make sure at least one officer but hopefully 2 or 3 sets of officers will come by just to say thank you to the citizens
1437493 why does john mccain think its ok for hundreds of tons of dangerous nuclear waste to go through ohio but yet too dangerous to go through his own state john mccain simply cant have it both ways when it comes to the nuclear waste issue right now he supports running hundreds of shipments of dangerous nuclear waste through ohio and sticking nevadans with 77 000 tons of it forever while at the same time saying hes uncomfortable with it going through his own backyard for even a day

1437631 it always fascinates me to see how stories move through the blogosphere and into mainstream media
1437632 back in september of last year i talked about some general questions people should ask before setting up a wiki the very first question i asked was is a wiki the best technology for what i am seeking to accomplish
1437633 social media must become part of the way public relations practitioners do business or they will become obsolete
1437634 relating to the public the evolving role of public relations in the age of social media
1437635 the majority of online shoppers who have used social and community sites while researching and purchasing do not believe that such sites affected their purchase decisions and few online shoppers said they spend incrementally more due to their use of social and community sites
1437636 retailer s should take a pause from all the hype theyve heard about social networking and social media because those sites are not something thats going to immediately drive incremental sales for them
1437637 we want some of that web 2 0 stuff how fast can you launch a campaign
1437638 social media must become part of the way public relations practitioners do business or they will become obsolete
1437639 relating to the public the evolving role of public relations in the age of social media
1437640 increasingly fortune 500 companies like ford wal mart sony and dell are embarking on social media marketing campaigns and blundering big time
1437641 at best they wasted a lot of money on ill conceived campaigns involving blogs video sharing sites like youtube social networks like myspace and other new media where users horrors can actually create content
1437642 at worst their futile attempts at old style message control masquerading as new media did permanent damage to their brands in the very markets that will determine their future fortunes
1437643 social media must become part of the way public relations practitioners do business or they will become obsolete
1437644 relating to the public the evolving role of public relations in the age of social media
1437645 as you may know not long ago a couple hundred thousand berliners made a lot of noise for my opponent ill take the roar of 50 000 harleys any day
1437646 my opponent wants to set a date to come home i want us to come home with victory and honor so we will never go back again
1437647 many students are interested film making and participating in audio video communication activities but rarely get the chance to actualy use broadcast equipment and create their own programming
1437648 these internships provide authentic experiences and hands on opportunities in film and communication as well as instruction from local film professionals
1437649 one of the highlights of the program was having montclair mayor jerry fried talk about his work as a video editor for television commercials
1437650 the mayor really got down to brass tacks letting the kids know that making it in this profession means putting in a lot of sweat equity and that the work isnt simply glamour and glitz
1437651 we invited municipal access television professionals such as woodbridges lee beckerman and bloomfields bob duthaler to teach the kids about various aspects of public broadcasting and television production including set lighting directing story boards and what it means to be a municipal access station
1437652 some of the kids have already volunteered to help out with tv34 programming to get direct experience doing what they hope will turn into a career path for them

1437657 se deben de tomar en cuenta todos los dolores y sufrimiento que hay en este pueblo y hay que tomar medidas para su reconocimiento pero esas medidas hay que tomarlas con todos los sufrimiento sin hacer distinciones

1437659 creo que en torno a l ha surgido un tremendo estruendo para entre otras cosas crear una especie de alarma lo que tengo claro es lo que yo har a marcar distancias y alejarse porque no le van a dejar en paz ni a l ni a la familia
1437660 ya ha cumplido la condena que le fue impuesta por los delitos que ha cometido
1437661 ya ha cumplido la condena que le fue impuesta por los delitos que ha cometido
1437662 todav a hemos visto estos d as al anterior ministro de justicia hablando de construir nuevas imputaciones para que de juana siguiera en la c rcel pero eso es hacer un flaco favor a la democracia y al estado de derecho
1437663 la democracia y el estado de derecho como m s se fortalecen es con la aplicaci n escrupulosa y rigurosa de la ley y de la normativa vigente en cada momento
1437664 si de juana sigue siendo un terrorista no arrepentido su lugar natural sigue siendo la c rcel
1437665 estamos haciendo m s publicidad y la publicidad fortalece a los movimientos terroristas
1437666 s lo pueden implantar el terror si se habla de ellos
1437667 el error que comete el estado de derecho con la reducci n de la condena y la excarcelaci n es que de juana est consiguiendo una segunda rentabilidad por sus m s de 20 asesinatos
1437668 los mercados laborales se han debilitado y los mercados financieros contin an bajo tensiones considerables

1437671 we need to be asking ourselves some pretty tough questions about why almost 1000 kids are being chucked out of primary schools for behaviour that is just so bad that schools have got to the point where they wont even work with it
1437672 but its when you look deeper into those statistics and you start to tease them out that you get a different kind of view of the world
1437673 and that view of the world fits with what we are experiencing in schools which is much more difficult scenarios all of the time
1437674 if you want to stop this behaviour you have to stop it as young as you possibly can
1437675 what it says is that we are seeing an increasing number of younger and younger students with behaviour and mental health issues
1437676 things are happening earlier were seeing children as young as five and six who are exhibiting dangerous behaviour
1437677 there are kids out there who cant see a way forward as young as five and six but they would be rare
1437678 anything is a weapon a stick out in the playground can be a weapon or a cricket wicket or a softball bat can be a weapon
1437679 the perceived credibility of blogs is significantly higher than the perceived credibility of any other traditional and online media
1437680 it was scary the back hatch of the van was open and my daughter was still under it and it came down on the back of the vehicle we thought it was a fairly sheltered site
1437681 i personally dont think im liable when a tree falls on me
1437682 i dont like the fact that im out of pocket through no fault of my own when these companies have insurance to cover this kind of thing
1437683 the van is in their care while they have the hire and anything that occurs during that hire is their responsibility

1437686 we chose lbi because of their breadth of experience in online marketing search engine marketing online display marketing and online video marketing
1437687 we also felt that lbi could help take hooked on phonics online brand awareness to the next level
1437688 the bandit horde has left its mark on this village all the huts have burnt to the ground and the people are completely demoralized the location of the lost ruins of mord are the last thing these people care about if your going to get any information your going to have to help these people get their village back together and raise their spirits this will not be short work

1437699 the captain elected to declare an emergency and get everybody out of the aircraft via the slides

1437701 you hear from time to time about planes returning to airports because an indicator light went on but its pretty rare that they actually deploy chutes
1437702 thats essentially up to the pilot who makes the call based on the particular circumstance he or she faced
1437703 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities
1437704 this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results
1437705 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques breaching security systems and installing programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly sold to others or used themselves

1437710 as a person who hasnt had a cigarette in 28 years
1437711 tens of billions of dollars have been pledged to combat aids yet donor countries have largely overlooked the role of nutrition somehow ignoring both the scientists and the beneficiaries
1437712 the donors have been asked for help often enough and there are united nations and nongovernmental organization projects out there to fund but they are not getting the cash they need to provide good nutritious food to people
1437713 micronutrient deficiencies often plague hiv infected adults and children and they can only be ended with diversified diets fortified foods or supplements
1437714 as food prices soar poor families are already substituting less nutritious foods for meat fish eggs and vegetables
1437715 poorest families are being forced to choose between food and medicine for loved ones
1437716 food itself as necessary for healing and not just for those affected by aids or tuberculosis
1437717 it is time to change the way we help drugs alone are not a solution for aids or tb
1437718 what doctor would admit a patient to a hospital give them the most advanced medications and then leave them to starve
1437719 problem is not with the procedure but the way it is abused by men so that men think they are now immune from
1437720 people think the disease originates with women why because it is the women who are tested first when they are about to give birth
1437721 introducing the procedure there was insufficient attention given to cultural factors attitudes and human psychology
1437722 many of the men i speak with think circumcision is like an aids vaccine its not its a useful tool to reduce chances of infection at a time and place where few other tools are available but you can still contract hiv and pass it on to a partner
1437723 until that happens women will be infected with hiv this way and male circumcision may do more harm than good if it is misused to deny women full protection
1437724 great fear that the gains made to reduce the prevalence of hiv in kenya would be lost
1437725 with time well start feeling the impact of this conflict on hiv and aids
1437726 democrats are determined to boost spending for key domestic priorities and for veterans
1437727 the same people who sell them today at u s 60 did not all the sudden have a conversion where they said im being greedy and now ill be generous they charged that because they had a small volume with a lot of fixed costs
1437728 now because of the unitaid funding there is a big volume with absolutely certain payments so they can charge a small profit margin on each individual lifesaving medication
1437729 if you look at the rising price of petroleum the rising price of food around the world we are all going to have to re examine how we produce food where we produce it how we consume it
1437730 its not just a question of energy prices its not just a question of global warming its a question of how we are going to keep our kids alive
1437731 it is possible to honor the treatment guidelines in my opinion only because of unitaid and the government of france
1437732 it may be the single most important contribution of france to the rest of the world since the end of the second world war
1437733 robust domestic aids agenda sensitive to the needs of all communities and relevant to the cultures of hispanic communities
1437734 hospitals are taking it upon themselves to repatriate seriously injured or ill immigrants because they cannot find nursing homes willing to accept them without insurance
1437735 hospitals are operating in a void without governmental assistance of oversight leaving ample room for legal and ethical transgressions on both sides of the border
1437736 see these repatriations as a kind of international patient dumping with ambulances taking patients in the wrong direction away from first world hospitals to less adequate care if any
1437737 hospital administrators view these cases as costly burdensome patient transfers that force them to shoulder responsibility for the dysfunctional immigration and health care systems
1437738 the decision has become what is known legally as a case of first impression on the issue of hospital repatriations
1437739 many struggle to pay for lifes basics housing food and health care and most report having virtually no financial cushion should they stumble
1437740 obama has the clear edge among those who picked a favorite on these core issues
1437741 if real fraudsters had been in charge of the fictitious companies they would have been clear to bill medicare from the virginia office for potentially millions of dollars worth of nonexistent supplies

1437743 this sting operation proves that there are gaps in the system and that scam artists can exploit and are exploiting those gaps
1437744 it is hard to diagnose the anemia of chronic disease

1437755 considering the seriousness of the alleged crimes the rwandan government has urged the relevant authorities to bring the accused french politicians and military officials to justice
1437756 did not challenge the infrastructure of genocide notably the checkpoints manned by the interahamwes
1437757 they clearly requested that the interahamwes contine to man those checkpoints and kill tutsis attempting to flee

1437767 he and his wife camille want to thank everyone who expressed concern
1437768 its blatantly discriminatory to single out people with hiv its stupid and ridiculous
1437769 these restrictions are really impeding our ability to control hiv and aids
1437770 i told him no because i thought it was stupid and discriminatory
1437771 its been humiliating to constantly be classified as a criminal
1437772 i think its great that america has finally seen the light
1437773 this is huge not only for the people who have not been able to enter the u s but finally these laws might be overturned throughout the world
1437774 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
1437775 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
1437776 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
1437777 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
1437778 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
1437779 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
1437780 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
1437781 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature
1437782 when girls are married off at a young age they will be deprived of education and of enjoying their childhood
1437783 their bodies wont be able to tolerate pregnancy and delivering children

1437793 a set of clear and rigorous principles such that restrictive governments would be unable to ignore or reject these best practices on freedom of expression and the protection of individual privacy

1437799 i have given the authority to my lawyer to look after my interest i am sure he will take all the steps to ensure that my dignity is maintained
1437800 when the general public have respect for me then how can a few of our own industry people make fun for me
1437801 i want to ask shah rukh that why did he feel offended when someone questioned his dignity for working for an ad of a hair oil when he is so cautious of his reputation then why is he not giving respect to others dignity
1437802 i being a punjabi can play the role i portray in mere pind more emphatically than anyone else
1437803 but when manmohanji offered me a role in mera pind i could not decline because i found my role to be very close to my heart

1437818 he has learned to use his hands better he may be the strongest guy we have so we have gotten him to utilize that
1437819 i was sitting in a jail cell not understanding if id ever play again now that im here and i have this opportunity im really embracing it
1437820 i dont take a day for granted because ive been in a position this could not be here
1437821 we chose the date because eight has always been our lucky number

1437823 we waited until 2008 because i like eight otherwise we would have gotten married earlier
1437824 i think what you have here is the gambino crime family reaching out to tampa fla
1437825 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1437826 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable
1437827 i simply wanted to make a colorful bright shoe that would go well with the warm weather i made it blue grey and pink so it can work for both genders plus its something you can wear to miami and stay up for three days and still look fresh

1437831 i think the guy shows up each day and he has a purpose when he practices
1437832 thats always going to be in the back of some peoples minds can the guy make it
1437833 we know that when ricky williams gets on the field and suits up that hes going to give you 100 percent effort and you know that hes going to go to the wall for you
1437834 hes an unbelievable player but its just keeping him on the field its like one of those things you have to show me you have to go out and give me a full season i dont think anybodys worried about it but its just a matter of him going out and getting it done
1437835 i got a whole bag of tricks to stay focused
1437836 for myself and ricky the positive competition is always good
1437837 i just want to make sure i dont do anything to make it any worse
1437838 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1437839 the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it
1437840 once again there has been indecision throughout bretts path back here to green bay its important for us to sit down and communicate there are some things we need to go through
1437841 none of those conversations suggest that favre was soliciting a job or that other teams were soliciting his services
1437842 i know if they do open it up to competition not a lot of people give me a chance but i believe in myself and im going to be the best i can be
1437843 the united states made sacrifices for south korea during the korean war and helped us live well

1437846 were at a very critical moment now for the north korean government to make a decision as to whether or not theyre going to verify what they said they would do
1437847 its one thing to say it but i think its going to be very important for them to understand that we expect them to show us
1437848 obviously wed like to see a greater role for south koreans in afghanistan if the south korean people are willing to move in that direction
1437849 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless
1437850 people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security
1437851 iraq has changed a lot thanks to the bravery of people in this hangar and the bravery of troops all across our country the terrorists are on the run the terrorists will be denied a safe haven and freedom is on the march and as a result our children are more likely to grow up in a peaceful world
1437852 and my hope is of course that as they have their security in place that theyre mindful of the spirit of the games and that if there is a provocation they handle it in a responsible way without violence
1437853 i told producer cameron mackintosh that would be the only way i could sing in front of everyone
1437854 so you are saying that government cannot discriminate in any way against any group i suppose you are in favor of homosexuals getting married

1437865 he finishes every run within his individual drills i see the guy working hard to get better
1437866 i think the guy shows up each day and he has a purpose when he practices
1437867 thats always going to be in the back of some peoples minds can the guy make it
1437868 we know that when ricky williams gets on the field and suits up that hes going to give you 100 percent effort and you know that hes going to go to the wall for you
1437869 hes an unbelievable player but its just keeping him on the field its like one of those things you have to show me you have to go out and give me a full season i dont think anybodys worried about it but its just a matter of him going out and getting it done
1437870 i got a whole bag of tricks to stay focused
1437871 for myself and ricky the positive competition is always good
1437872 i just want to make sure i dont do anything to make it any worse
1437873 it was our home for two and a half months and now were like ok so what do we do now
1437874 we feel good about whats going on in the country and along the route
1437875 we just had one person who chose to do something that wasnt so great
1437876 these constituents have the intelligence and they should have the free will to do this there are three candidates vying for the opportunity to serve but with this resolution this body is taking it upon itself to personally eliminate one of these candidates

1437880 companies are able to maintain their earnings and margins but theyre being squeezed a lot you can only get by for so long if the economy doesnt get better the earnings will eventually suffer
1437881 i dont see many areas of the market where were truly growing growing by shrinking is great for a quarter or two but not a sustainable story
1437882 whenever you look at earnings you have to question what it means going forward and you have to appreciate what ceos have done in this kind of operating environment
1437883 the reality is that companies have come up with reasonably good numbers and how they got there in the face of a slowing economy is to their credit not detriment
1437884 french soldiers themselves directly were involved in assassinations of tutsis and hutus accused of hiding tutsis

1437886 this is absolutely everything for me but the arbat will lose more what is this place without the people who bring it to life
1437887 they dont have receipts and they fake their prices it really surprises me they lasted this long

1437889 we wont die out as a species that is definite
1437890 we understand that the european court has today ordered that abu hamzas extradition should be stayed while it considers his appeal against extradition to the u s
1437891 the decision is a matter for the european court the u k cannot extradite hamza while the court has ordered his extradition to be stayed
1437892 the reason she got challenged on that was her own doing
1437893 if she had not been out publicly defending his behavior it wouldnt have happened in the first place
1437894 raise whatever he needs for his defense as any mother in this room would do
1437895 what should be noted today is whether you violate the federal law today tomorrow or 20 years ago the fbi and its law enforcement partners will pursue the matter to its logical conclusions
1437896 they tried very hard to convict him up here they spared no resources and it didnt work
1437897 its tragic for him and his family to have to continually go through this its almost laughable

1437903 mosh pit but rather from the glorious unpredictability of a live television broadcast populated by hungry nervous and sometimes incredibly talented amateurs
1437904 its brilliant because people that dont usually go to our gigs are exposed to our music
1437905 busking is fascinating because you strip everything away theres no keyboards no massive drums and yet the same songs get to people its really nice to have that confidence that your core still appeals to people
1437906 at that time we suspected foul play and we werent sure we ran down all possible leads
1437907 six years ago we all just thought she was dead
1437908 i mean we just thought we were going to find her if ever in a bad way
1437909 ive been in contact with her mother since i began as sheriff and we would continuously would run her social security number and make sure that she wasnt in the system weve obviously feared the worst but we got some great news yesterday
1437910 i know you have a million questions i would love to answer for you but i do have to respect michelles right to privacy
1437911 my goal and my wish is to expand media coverage to get my daughters face in every outlet there is to let people see her face because i think theres someone out there that knows what happened to her
1437912 i dont know if theres going to be contact made or not thats family business im not going to be involved with
1437913 if she did she didnt let on like she did im not going to say she wasnt trying to hide im just going to say that it was very difficult to find her
1437914 she did not change her name though normally when youre missing and your social security number is inactive and we cant find you in a certain amount of time normally youre deceased or youve changed your name and ran off she didnt do either of those she just left
1437915 vans shoes will be moving locations at the end of september to pursue a new business opportunity for his products the owner has mentioned that he could always look to the shops of grand avenue in the future to reopen this location
1437916 no google took over because it was the first engine that just gave you simple text that you could read without spinning blinking images and tons of other crap cluttering up the page
1437917 we decided this is the best place to show his talent
1437918 race him in america race him on a surface hes already a champion and put it in a historic venue where we can add to his legend
1437919 if youre in this sport long enough you certainly learn a horse likes predictability they like to be certain of what theyre going to do they love consistency running back and forth changing surfaces didnt seem to be the best thing for him
1437920 i want him to be appreciated by most of the breeders id like to see his genes its a hard decision whether to retire and improve the gene pool or let him run
1437921 i was so stunned i didnt know what to do

1437961 borat cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan
1437962 if you look at most of these r rated movies that found an audience its because they were really good
1437963 the r rating allows the filmmakers to truly realize their vision theres just a freedom that comes with it theres no way wedding crashers could have been wedding crashers if you inhibit what it was that owen wilson and vince vaughn were able to do in that movie
1437964 we were like gosh everyones getting to have their cake and eat it too with 40 year old virgin and wedding crashers
1437965 just this little opening seemed to happen with the way the studios were willing to go ok r rated movies seem to be profitable so well maybe open that door a little bit
1437966 you luckily have some hit movies and then you kind of go ok you want us to do another one
1437967 there was no talk of toning it down there was no intention of making a conventional movie in an attempt to reach a mass audience
1437968 we wouldnt have wanted to do something that didnt reflect the show and didnt respect the audiences investment in the show and what made it different and unique
1437969 anythings possible and so more than wanting to make it an r rated movie we just wanted the freedom to make it whatever its going to be
1437970 also comedys job is to push boundaries we didnt make the boundaries we didnt move the last boundary but here we are people are expecting something a little crazier than the last thing they saw

1437980 do i hear you volunteering to walk my dog or are you offering to push the stroller asshole
1437981 that woman back there was very selfish and rude but you picked her up on your back and carried her then she didnt even thank you
1437982 you cant take back or redo anything in your relationship now so dont waste your time on those moments spend your time on the good moments
1437983 i must admit that im a bit lonely that might also be because several of my close friends have not called or emailed me since i moved and no one has visited i am quite surprised and a little bit hurt

1437993 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1437994 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

1438002 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1438003 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1438004 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1438005 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1438006 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security

1438008 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
1438009 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
1438010 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1438011 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1438012 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1438013 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1438014 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1438015 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1438016 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1438017 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1438018 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
1438019 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
1438020 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
1438021 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
1438022 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1438023 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1438024 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

1438029 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
1438030 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
1438031 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1438032 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1438033 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1438034 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
1438035 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
1438036 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1438037 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
1438038 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis

1438044 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1438045 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

1438061 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1438062 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1438063 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
1438064 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1438065 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1438066 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1438067 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1438068 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1438069 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
1438070 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1438071 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1438072 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1438073 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1438074 this demonstrates a long term u s commitment to the people of our hemisphere it will further develop and promote cooperative relationships with friendly countries to ensure we continue economic development and the growth and promotion of democratic institutions
1438075 we must work in a bipartisan manner to avoid any negative influence of nations that seek to increase false democracies and prop up existing dictatorships this is an important effort that will fund programs to improve education reduce poverty promote better healthcare and provide improved housing i commend members of the committee for approving this bill and urge senate leadership to bring the bill to the full senate for consideration
1438076 this initiative aims to make the united states safer stronger and more prosperous by making our hemisphere more stable and more affluent
1438077 our lack of engagement in latin america has created a vacuum that has allowed some to sell an anti american agenda which simply has no place in the region this type of commitment to the development of latin american nations and their institutions helps fill that vacuum and make our nation more secure a strong social and economic backbone is a foundation upon which democracies can prosper this will enable stable communities and a stable region
1438078 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
1438079 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
1438080 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1438081 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1438082 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1438083 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1438084 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
1438085 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
1438086 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that

1438110 als ich zehn jahre alt war hat mir meine ltere schwester gezeigt wie und wo man sich rasiert seitdem rasiere ich mich regelm ig ich f hle mich so wohler und finde es auch optisch sch ner als wenn alles zugewachsen ist zudem habe ich schon mitbekommen dass unrasierte frauen schnell mal als ko oder so hnlich bezeichnet werden
1438111 ich habe in der sechsten oder siebten klasse angefangen mich zu rasieren zu der zeit haben irgendwie alle damit angefangen und wer sich nicht rasiert hat wurde auch schnell gemobbt ich finde es aber auch einfach hygienischer
1438112 ich rasiere alles blank nur die haare auf dem kopf d rfen dranbleiben angefangen habe ich damit im teenageralter als alle anderen auch begonnen haben sich zu rasieren ich fand es aber auch selbst schon damals viel sch ner wenn alles glatt rasiert ist
1438113 bei meiner freundin m ssen die haare alle weg ich erwarte von ihr dass sie sich rasiert denn ich tue es ja schlie lich auch
1438114 ich finde es auf jeden fall sch ner wenn frauen sich rasieren meine freundin ist auch rasiert und so kann ich ihre sch ne weiche haut streicheln ohne dass st rende h rchen im weg sind meiner meinung nach sehen rasierte frauen einfach wesentlich gepflegter aus und f hlen sich auch gepflegter an
1438115 meine freundin rasiert sich weil sie es selbst sch ner findet generell finde ich auch dass sich rasierte haut besser anf hlt aber ehrlich gesagt st ren mich bei meiner freundin ein paar kleine stoppeln nicht es gibt doch schlie lich noch wichtigeres im leben
1438116 fr her habe ich mir die beine ab und zu mal rasiert aber mittlerweile mache ich das nicht mehr mich st ren haare an den beinen nicht und meinen mann auch nicht au erdem trage ich sowieso meistens hosen unter den achseln rasiere ich mich aber weil man da ja auch mehr schwitzt
1438117 ich rasiere mich seit ich 13 jahre alt bin ich habe gemeinsam mit meinen freundinnen damit angefangen als wir gemerkt haben dass alle in unserem alter sich rasieren zun chst rasierte ich nur die beine und die achseln sp ter kam dann auch die bikinizone dazu ich habe die erfahrung gemacht dass die jungs darauf bestehen dass man als frau rasiert ist und ich finde es auch selbst sch ner
1438118 seit ich 15 bin m ssen bei mir alle haare weg ich find haare eklig nur die haare auf dem kopf d rfen nat rlich bleiben und die an den armen weil man sie kaum sieht ich finde es hygienischer wenn frauen sich rasieren und es sieht auch besser aus unter meinen freundinnen werden auch mal spr che gemacht wenn bei einer stoppeln zu sehen sind
1438119 ich rasiere mir seit ich 13 bin die beine die achseln und die bikinizone ich finde das normal es ist ja heute eher unnormal sich nicht zu rasieren allerdings bin ich froh dass ich nicht in amerika lebe als ich dort ein jahr auf die high school gegangen bin wurde jeder bl d angemacht der nicht perfekt rasiert war in deutschland ist das ein bisschen lockerer
1438120 ich erwarte von frauen dass sie sich rasieren rasierte beine und achseln sehen auf jeden fall viel sch ner aus eine unrasierte frau w rde f r mich als freundin gar nicht in frage kommen und es ist eben auch wesentlich sexyer wenn die frauen sich rasieren da guckt man dann gleich viel lieber hin

1438166 canadian olympic fans had better rest up because a marathon of tv newspaper radio and internet observations are just about to kick into high gear
1438167 with a record number of hours on tv and more than 20 000 accredited media from around the world the beijing olympics will supply an unprecedented amount of coverage of the games
1438168 these feelings are strong in a multicultural country like our own where many are separated from their native homelands
1438169 one can expect a rollercoaster of emotions of high peaks and deep valleys during events and over the course of the games
1438170 days are very long during the olympics as coach athlete commentator and as a spectator
1438171 but while those at home have the luxury of turning on the tv and getting live action from all dozen venues that day moving around an olympic city can be a competition in endurance all by itself
1438172 continuously remind oneself that as a fan whats taking place on tv or a hockey rink soccer pitch or baseball field for that matter is beyond your control

1438185 the summer schools give a taste of university for young people it gives them the chance to live on campus and see what student life is like and have a taste of lectures and learn how finances work and about looking after yourself
1438186 we give presentations on choosing the right university and course and also talks on finance to reassure them that they can afford it
1438187 parents are usually concerned about finance and safety while the students are more concerned about the courses and what the campus is like
1438188 we try to get across to them that everything is on one site and its a very safe environment with a community feel and also explain the college system and the differences between living on campus or in student houses
1438189 its important that they get a good feel for the places
1438190 its a big transition for them and we try to help them as much as possible
1438191 my sister didnt enjoy her first year at university so i was a bit worried but i felt very comfortable here and within the first week i felt at home
1438192 a lot of people have never cooked a proper meal or had to budget before but i think the best thing is to just have a go at it for yourself and there will always be people who can help you if you
1438193 both the students union and the university can help if you feel like you cant cope
1438194 worrying about finding friends is a big thing for a lot of people but its really not something to worry about
1438195 you just have to remember that anybody you meet could be a potential friend even if they are not like your friends from home
1438196 i have got friends who went out to work after year 11 but i never really thought about doing that
1438197 its quite scary really because you just dont know what to expect theres things to worry about like finance and the people you might have to live with
1438198 but the thought of going to a new place is exciting and i am quite looking forward to it
1438199 my mum really does want me to go but she keeps telling me she will miss me
1438200 but she went to newcastle university as well so she knows what its like
1438201 it was a massive surprise because its such a big change and for the first term i found it really difficult to adapt to the new way of life
1438202 i had such a good time at school and had so many good friends and going to a new place that was probably what i missed the most
1438203 everyone is so desperate at the end of school to get away but i think you should really appreciate how good school is and how good your friends are
1438204 after the first term i wondered if university was for me but at the end of the year i didnt want to leave
1438205 its been like a rollercoaster ride but as time has gone on i have settled in
1438206 i think the thing that hit me the most was that it takes until the end of the first year to find a lot of friends
1438207 when you go away it does take time and you dont really appreciate that at first but everyone is in the same boat
1438208 i feel after a year away like i have learnt so much about myself and i think if i had stayed at home and gone to university it wouldnt have been the same
1438209 its good to know you can live away from your mum and dad and do practical things like cooking at home your mum is always there to do your washing or cooking but at university you have got to do everything for yourself so you get much more independent
1438210 just being in a random place and not knowing anyone makes you stronger and its good to think you have got through it

1438216 we believe that the decision to list the polar bear was not based on the best scientific and commercial data available

1438218 additional regulation of the species and its habitat under the endangered species act will deter activities such as commercial fisheries oil and gas exploration and development transportation and tourism within and off shore of alaska

1438228 49ers fans dont respect us because we are blue collar workers they think we are beneath them and therefore are just trash
1438229 raider fans are just thugs gang members and pimps and we are a much higher brand of fan we dont consort with the likes of people like them raider fans make me sick
1438230 best thing for this team is for us to part ways
1438231 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner roger goodell reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1438232 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1438233 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1438234 of course of course ill keep going imagine if i gave up now

1438238 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1438239 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1438240 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1438241 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term

1438244 for older black leaders whose road to washington began with civil rights marches and southern jails the prospect of a barack obama presidency is gratifying but unsettling as well in post race contributing writer matt bai asks what a black president would mean for black politics the slowness of old washington hands charles rangel john lewis jesse jackson to embrace obama as a torch bearer was one sign of wariness that the absorption of black politics into american politics could ironically mean a decline of black influence

1438296 the in stadium experience is critically important to the nfl our clubs and our fans and it will be a major focus this season
1438297 we are committed to improving the fan experience in every way we can from the time fans arrive in the parking lot to when they depart the stadium
1438298 theyve asked for our wish list of politicans wed like to be there for us to poke fun at
1438299 its new but the writing is on the wall with open source even traditional players like cisco and nortel are developing systems based on open source
1438300 we think its at the point where the vendors and the products are ready for prime time
1438301 one of the first challenges was to help resellers overcome an inefficient means for getting product information pricing and availability and to put it all together in a quote that made sense as if it came from a proprietary vendor
1438302 we put together a rules based systems that allows anyone to go through the configurator and minimize any mistakes and the time it takes to get the information from multiple web sites
1438303 the one thing we dont have in here currently is wireless that would seem like a natural fit
1438304 weve got wireless vendors as part of our overall portfolio i would think that if we were to grow this our next step is to wireless at this point were really focused with digium
1438305 the reality is that for large scale deployments i dont think wed use it but for anything under 100 users its easy to do it gives our sales people the right solutions that are compliant
1438306 and once the product list is built with a click of a button you can repackage all the information into pdfs to present to a customer
1438307 i typed the word google into google guess what came up everything
1438308 you know whats fun go to a german restaurant and insist on using chopsticks
1438309 si los bosques siguen siendo destruidos y deteriorados el di xido de carbono desprendido aumentar de forma significativa las concentraciones de gases de efecto invernadero en la atm sfera
1438310 properties on the avenue change hands for up to 41 million and many of them are fairly modest four bedroom apartments
1438311 perhaps even sooner than that if we encounter no obstacles
1438312 theyre trolls and thats what they want you to do linger stay fight a while if they kill you they win and if they dont kill you the creatures that roam this cursed land after sunset will either way theyll crunch your bones for your marrow
1438313 how can obama such a brilliant student of american law politics and culture not get the joke or at least not recognize that the joke was on his enemies
1438314 if obama wants to be the nations leader he can start leading here he needs to leave the atmosphere of censorship at the harvard law school and join the ranks of free men and women
1438315 the sad fact in my estimation remains there are still things harvard law students could safely say in harvard square that they wouldnt dare utter in harvard yard
1438316 they knowingly allowed crooks to use their trademark for six or seven months without doing anything about it
1438317 to pull that much weight youll need a very specific model the supercab 4x2 with the 5 4l v8 and heavy duty payload package
1438318 you are going to see solid but decelerating benefits from exports on us growth as we move into 2009
1438319 leading in the direction we should expect with a slowing global economy
1438320 spillovers from the us slowdown higher inflation reduced energy subsidies tighter monetary policies and tighter financial conditions
1438321 close to half of the us export pie is now undergoing its own severe slowing in demand
1438322 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1438323 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1438324 surprisingly we found that most drivers had tires between 5 and 7 pounds under inflated some had tires under inflated by as much as 20 pounds
1438325 exclusive auto makers deflate mccains ignorant hot air on value of proper tire inflation
1438326 if conservatives truly want to take immediate action on energy they can stop wasting time on political stunts and start checking their tires
1438327 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1438328 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1438329 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1438330 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1438331 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1438332 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1438333 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1438334 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1438335 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1438336 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1438337 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1438338 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1438339 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1438340 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1438341 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1438342 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1438343 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1438344 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1438345 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1438346 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1438347 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1438348 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1438349 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1438350 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1438351 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1438352 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1438353 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1438354 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1438355 was sent to new york on a project for the book
1438356 detained by federal agents in manhattan he was interrogated and his notes were confiscated violations of his first and fourth amendment rights
1438357 the book reports or charges that the bush white house faked a letter from saddam husseins intelligence chief to president saddam in late 2003 backdating it to july 2001 and reports that saddams intelligence chief habbush was in the protective custody of the c i a at the time even while the u s military had him in the deck of cards a list of saddam officials wanted dead or alive the white house ordered the c i a to arrange for habbush to write the fake letter in his own handwriting the controversial letter did find itself to the world media in december 03

1438410 mend will offer materials such as explosives to communities that have now realised that it is better to destroy oil facilities in their territory since they do not benefit them in the first place

1438412 todays attack was prompted by the continuous injustice in the niger delta region of nigeria where the root issues have not been addressed then finally to show our way of saying
1438413 we have nothing to loose because he that is down need fear no fall

1438423 hey wo gehtn hier der text weiter guckt euch das mal an
1438424 these are the ones sown among thorns for they are the ones who hear the word and the cares of this world the deceitfullness of riches and the desires for other things entering in choke the word and it becomes unfruitful

1438427 es war eigentlich nicht viel los was auch ein grund daf r war dass ich nach brighton gezogen bin irgendwie klingt auch meine musik nach dem woher ich komme und nach dem wo ich jetzt bin
1438428 es hat extrem lange gedauert die samplerechte abzukl ren ich habe derart viele songs gesampelt und schon bald wurde uns klar dass wir sie nicht alle verwenden konnten es h tte einfach so viel gekostet dass ich beim verkauf meines albums keinen einzigen cent verdienen w rde also mussten wir einige samples nachspielen und neu abmischen lassen das alles hat ziemlich viel zeit in anspruch genommen
1438429 ich habe eigentlich mit instrumentalem hip hop angefangen zu einer zeit als diese musikrichtung sich noch ausschlie lich samples bediente das in der plattenkiste w hlen und dinge hervorzukramen und wiederzuentdecken die vielleicht noch keiner geh rt hat und diesen songs einen neuen kontext zu geben das hat mich schon immer fasziniert ich editiere ja die samples so extrem dass es fast schon eigene t ne werden mit denen ich dann meine akkorde zusammenbaue so bleibt der sound des originals noch erhalten ohne einen l ngeren langweiligen loop verwenden zu m ssen

1438434 uma boa leva de pol ticos no brasil deveria olhar para os dados do datafolha com vergonha vergonha de si mesmos e de sua covardia existe uma maioria silenciosa que hoje n o encontra uma representa o consistente uma boa pergunta seria a seguinte como pode lula vencer ao menos por enquanto a disputa presidencial no 1 turno se a maioria da popula o mesmo de direita

1438438 excessive use of private contractors erodes checks and balances and it substitutes market transactions controlled by the executive branch for traditional political mechanisms of accountability when it comes to iraq weve yet to see the evidence of a large practical gain in return instead use of contractors may have helped to make an ill advised venture possible

1438452 walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind on the border line of the edge
1438453 now the old king is dead long live the king
1438454 obama can call himself anything he likes but there is a clear requirement for one to qualify as a christian and obama doesnt meet that requirement
1438455 a bridge between god and man and one that i think is powerful precisely because he serves as that means of us reaching something higher
1438456 yeah although i retain from my childhood and my experiences growing up a suspicion of dogma and im not somebody who is always comfortable with that language that implies ive got a monopoly on the truth or that my faith is automatically transferable to others
1438457 the difficult thing about any religion including christianity is that at some level there is a call to evangelize and proselytize theres the belief certainly in some quarters that if people havent embraced jesus christ as their personal savior theyre going to hell
1438458 a christian is a person who trusts in the redemptive work of god in christ and seeks to live that out
1438459 i do believe that there is an existential relationship with god that transcends even what we say
1438460 in certain quarters were going to shift this and then next quarters well turn on the spigot again
1438461 i cannot believe journalists accept that award the cda hands out each year
1438462 unlike 40 years ago when journalists were amongst the best educated and best informed citizens today many of them are neither literate nor numerate and do us the huge discourtesy of assuming we arent either
1438463 the narcissism of portions of the media who report incessantly on themselves
1438464 reporters stick microphones under the noses of whatever slack jawed gum chewing vagrants they can find on the street to ask them what they think about oil prices or border security or equalization payments
1438465 what he terms slack jawed gum chewing vagrants i might call canadians whose views as voters taxpayers and most importantly citizens count just as much as the next persons
1438466 contemplate the possibility of political discourse not pushed through the microcephalic filter of some illeducated but firm jawed stage prop of a newsreader we might get political discourse appropriate for a free people making critical decisions about their national enterprise and its role in the world
1438467 attain a minimum of 29 media references to the cda by national or regional journalists and reporters
1438468 attain the publication of a minimum of 15 opinion pieces including op eds and letters to the editor in national or regional publications

1438482 mike and i both agreed last night that me being out there is a distraction and will continue to be a distraction we all know the reason im here is because the commissioner reinstated me so we have a lot of things to figure out its simple and complicated both at the same time
1438483 mike told me hey were a better team with you on it but wanted to know if i have a problem with an open competition
1438484 i dont have a problem with competing you know that but aaron should be the starter right now because hes been out here all this time this is more than about an open competition and i can do that absolutely but this is going to be mass confusion and thats not good for this team
1438485 ill practice my butt off if it comes to that and i think we all know what the end result will be but this probably isnt going to work
1438486 they want to know if im committed but i want to know if theyre 100 percent committed the problem is that theres been a lot of damage done and i cant forget it stuff has been said stories planted that just arent true can i get over all that i doubt it

1438504 for the first time since this general election campaign began in early june republican john mccain attracted virtually as much media attention as his democratic rival last week
1438505 in a fragile economy in which jobs are being lost there is a poignancy in watching someone who has given so much not be allowed a change of heart about retirement
1438506 but i do believe that the inflammatory rhetoric in the immigration debate does have a correlation with increased violence against latinos
1438507 mr mccains sense of wonder evoked the episode in the early 1990s when george h w bush became overly impressed upon seeing a price scanner at a supermarket check out counter it suggested to some people that the president who had spent four years in the white house after spending eight years as vice president was out of touch with the lives of average americans
1438508 i am forcing myself let me put it this way i am using the computer more and more every day

1438512 our goals are more of the same the idea that he said hes iron man in part 1 its one thing to say it and its another thing to actually evolve to the point where you can live in a heroic fashion you know they say the superhero movie always needs to follow and i said who is that guy get him out of here we want to do what worked for us last time in a way that evolves
1438513 were talking about a guy who is put in an extraordinary circumstance and the people that are around him and how that creates a sense of family and how that disrupts whatever forces that we have to say that are working in his life
1438514 informed us of how expensive it was becoming to care for luis given that there was no insurance and that he is illegal and that the state wont assume responsibility for his charges

1438517 baiklah kanjeng saya akan berupaya sekuat tenaga seperti yang kanjeng sunan giri sarankan meski saya harus jatuh miskin itu hanyalah ukuran dunia dan bentuk tanggungjawab pada rakyat
1438518 dimas bantulah mereka yang kelaparan berbuatlah untuk mensejahterakan rakyat tebuslah kesalahan kita kakang tidak ingin mendengar kabar ada rakyat yang masih kelaparan bunuh diri karena miskin berbuatlah kakang pun akan berbuat dengan tangan ini yang telah berlumur dosa karena bodoh dan khilaf
1438519 ada persoalan yang lebih penting ketimbang rasa lapar dan kemiskinan
1438520 bukankah miskin dan lapar yang bisa memicu orang berbuat nekad merampas hak orang lain merampok mungkin juga bunuh diri
1438521 benar raden seakan akan persoalan perutlah yang terpenting dalam kehidupan ini
1438522 bayangkan seandainya mereka kenyang dan serba berkecukupan tidak akan mungkin berbuat demikian
1438523 orang miskin merampok hanya butuh makan untuk satu hari pangeran sedangkan yang kaya disebabkan sifat serakah
1438524 bukankah hartanya sudah melimpah ruah tetapi masih saja ingin menumpuk kekayaan menghalalkan segala cara
1438525 terlepas dari urusan miskin dan kaya yang jelas penyelesaian dari sebuah perbuatan buruk tadi mereka hanya menyantap makanan jasmani sedangkan rohaninya kosong
1438526 bukankah para sahabat nabi juga menafkahkan seluruh hartanya demi agama lihatlah khalifah umar bin khatab jubah dan pakaiannya penuh dengan tambalan meski secara lahiryah terlihat miskin namun hatinya sangat kaya jiwanya tersisi penuh tidak pernah berkhianat selalu bertaqwa pada allah
1438527 kemiskinan dan kelaparan yang melanda negeri demak bintoro dimanfaatkan pengikut ajaran syekh siti jenar untuk menyimpang dari agama sehingga memicu persoalan baru
1438528 banyak rakyat miskin dan kelaparan bunuh diri keadaan dibuat kalangkabut dan kacau balau selain aqidah mereka masih lemah pengaruh ajaran sesat dan menyesatkan semakin kuat sehingga mereka dengan ajarannya telah mencoba menodai perjuangan para wali
1438529 gusti menurut hemat hamba tersebarnya ajaran sesat syekh siti jenar terkait pula dengan persoalan politik
1438530 bukankah ki ageng pengging selain murid juga sangat dekat dengan syekh siti jenar disamping masih keturunan majapahit mungkin dia punya anggapan memiliki hak yang sama untuk meraih tahta
1438531 maaf kanjeng sunan kalijaga rasanya ini telah sulit untuk dipilah ditebarnya kekacauan dengan isu agama sangat sarat dengan muatan politik
1438532 dimas bayat untuk menjernihkan persoalan ini saya sependapat dengan kanjeng sunan kalijaga
1438533 tetapi seandainya belum atau tidak pernah terjadi pemberontakan di kademangan bintoro
1438534 dalam hal ini tetap harus ada keputusan raden terkait dengan ajaran sesat syekh siti jenar
1438535 pemerintah harus segera mengambil tindakan sebelum pengaruh ajaran sesat ini semakin meluas
1438536 haruskah saya seret syekh siti jenar dan pengikutnya ke hadapan gusti

1438540 i was in union mo which is 98 percent white a rural conservative and what i said was what i think everyone knows which is that i dont look like i came out of central casting when it comes to presidential candidates
1438541 there was nobody there who thought at all that i was trying to inject race in this
1438542 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck
1438543 doesnt look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills
1438544 they are running commercials about hilton and britney i mean thats frivolous

1438546 if someone wanted to pick the most vulnerable group in the country youd be hard pressed to find one easier than autistic children
1438547 we are dismayed that these grossly inaccurate remarks would be aired in any platform much less on a nationally syndicated show we will continue to work with families people with autism and the broader public to raise awareness of autism spectrum disorders

1438551 web 3 0 in a greedy or underhanded way their corporate directions are only a logical result of where they genuinely think things are going not vice versa
1438552 considering they the board have made a decision and said publicly they dont plan on revisiting it i dont know that thats an issue that will come up again
1438553 1 make the majoritys life miserable grinding the house and senate floors to a halt and building a narrative of the democrats as broken and incompetent
1438554 in the minority our job is to 1 make the majoritys life miserable grinding the house and senate floors to a halt and building a narrative of the democrats as broken and incompetent and 2 offer big bold alternatives to this mess like the contract did in 1994
1438555 our job is to make the majoritys life miserable grinding the house and senate floors to a halt
1438556 the opposition party is supposed to prevent the majority from making massive mistakes with the government not try to hamstring government so that it cannot serve the publics interest
1438557 it is the job of the minority to slow down legislation they think is the wrong direction for the country thats how the system works
1438558 1 make the majoritys life miserable grinding the house and senate floors to a halt and building a narrative of the democrats as broken and incompetent and 2 offer big bold alternatives to this mess like the contract did in 1994
1438559 i love playing dress up i get inspired by old films weird things it could just be the person sitting across from me or it could be a full victorian costume what i find odd though is that a weekly magazine will come out describing my outfit as a fashion disaster while the fashion industry actually respects what i wear
1438560 i think more of my energy goes in to elizabeth and james the row is ashleys baby
1438561 i have so much more respect for fashion designers now because its hard work and never ending its not a movie you cant wrap it and go start something else
1438562 when barack won the nomination i just started bawling i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy theyre like well he hasnt won yet but im like yes he has because hes gotten this far so what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say that a black man can be president too i think it will give so many people black latin asian even white people that feel forgotten hope i did not think i would see it in my lifetime and im only 34
1438563 she always had her own opinions about things and she didnt hesitate to say so because we allowed it she just seemed like she wanted to do the right thing all the time without being told and she wanted to be the best at things she liked winning
1438564 as a person who is interested in people she is down to earth she is very smart i always say if you want something done just ask michelle shell get it done and get it done fast and if she doesnt know how to do it shell go find out and still get it done she likes people she can relate to people shes friendly she doesnt look down to people and she likes kids
1438565 barack and i as partners as friends and as lovers we accessorize each other in many ways the best thing i love having on me is barack on my arm and vice versa whether its having him standing there smiling at me or watching him mesmerize a crowd or talk to some seniors in a senior center
1438566 the obamas pride themselves on creating a family picture that is authentically black with shades of norman rockwell
1438567 michelle has done a heroic job of managing the house the family and still finding time to campaign and be out on the road im always marveling at everything that she can do
1438568 we dont acknowledge which countries we have contingency plans for we dont acknowledge any of our contingency plans
1438569 we now face an opportunity and an obligation to turn the page on the failed politics of yesterdays health care debates my plan begins by covering every american if you already have health insurance the only thing that will change for you under this plan is the amount of money you will spend on premiums that will be less if you are one of the 45 million americans who dont have health insurance you will have it after this plan becomes law no one will be turned away because of a preexisting condition or illness
1438570 food is such a basic need that you can see people really going to great lengths
1438571 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
1438572 if you want to see the future imagine someones boot stamping on the human face forever
1438573 its not like a car where you do a little bit of maintenance you check the oil the air filter the oil filter and off you go and then in four years you buy a new one
1438574 brought back by the autobots who need him to conquer the new menace but ive learned that this time he wont be that weird alien jet this time hes a tank
1438575 thieves are known to cut open hot water cylinders and remove copper lining which in turn causes water damage to properties
1438576 were all supposed to keep records of what we buy and who from at the end of the day it comes back on us as an industry
1438577 ive had customers in here who have been going to other scrap metal yards for years without ever having had their details recorded
1438578 this indictment prevents stevens from effectively serving and he should leave office
1438579 big religion and the nanny state party that would not only supervise your personal life but also manage your relationship to god
1438580 when i tour im neither homosexual or heterosexual im hobo sexual
1438581 je ne sais rien de cette histoire on ne ma rien communiqu rien nest vrai
1438582 every time obama had seven seconds when we spent the day together in south carolina he whipped out his blackberry
1438583 neither im an illiterate that has to rely on my wife for all of the assistance i can get
1438584 i agree nevermind the lib smirkers no matter what happens they will be singing a different tune in two years
1438585 with all due respect my opinion of president bush matters about as much as my opinion of president coolidge
1438586 every republican has to kiss the ring of some baptist whackjob or he doesnt stand a chance within the party
1438587 a well honed machine run like ibm at its peak not a hungry innovative startup
1438588 the passengers are prepared to remain on board for weeks or longer if their passage is impeded
1438589 gaza is a virtual prison for well over a million palestinians its been under siege almost continuously for two years israel says it no longer occupies the gaza strip so the boat will not be asking permission from israel and will not allow israel to board the boats
1438590 as a doctor there is nothing more sad for me than watching my patients dying
1438591 the idea is when we get to gaza we have broken the siege
1438592 citi understands the challenges facing consumers in todays economic environment
1438593 by working closely with mastercard and exxonmobil we were able to enhance the value proposition of our exxonmobil co branded card to deliver a card with strong consumer appeal offering cents per gallon gasoline rebates allowing consumers to easily calculate their savings and offering a competitive annual percentage rate with no annual fee
1438594 in an effort to offer one of the most competitive programs in the industry this unique new card differentiates us from the competition and will continue to drive customer loyalty for our exxon and mobil locations nationwide
1438595 we are really unique in the convenience store industry and with our business model locating stores in smaller rural communities throughout the midwest
1438596 the majority of our stores are in towns of 3 000 person population or less we serve not only as the gas station but also in many cases the grocery store and restaurant
1438597 we make from scratch not only pizza but donuts as well and offer a wide variety of other products
1438598 in fact we are a top 10 retailer of pizza and donuts in the nation we also own all of our assets which is unique in the business and self distribute about 90 of the grocery products in our store it comes out of our distribution center centrally located here at corporate headquarters
1438599 being located in smaller communities there is less competition not only from a convenience store perspective but less competition from a quick serve restaurant perspective from an entry level labor perspective lower cost to build and even lower cost to purchase when we go under acquisition strategy
1438600 we have very low debt a very strong balance sheet
1438601 in fact we would be considered investment grade so i think all those components kind of rolled up sum up the success of our company
1438602 people are still coming into our stores they are still buying the soda or the cup of coffee or donut or a slice of pizza or whatever they are buying
1438603 for example with gasoline several years ago a load of gasoline would cost 10 000
1438604 now a load of gasoline is somewhere between 30 000 and 35 000 we turn our gasoline about every three days and our payment terms are 10 days i am pretty confident that some of the smaller operators would not have that same type of payment term its been quite frankly a crunch on working capital for some of the smaller operators
1438605 its much more engaged and shows much more respect and embrace of the consumer than saying here just enter our sweepstakes
1438606 the point of welcome to the brotherhood is to embrace the dippers who are already a part of this brand and is intended to show that this is a brand that i as an adult smoker might want to be a part of
1438607 looking at playboys data about 600 000 of its readership are currently smokeless tobacco consumers and another 3 7 million are adult smokers

1438616 three billion dollars are needed over three years for infrastructure and the equivalent amount for investment projects

1438618 forests working for the global climate reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries redd
1438619 it all started at the time of the us primaries
1438620 after studying obamas electro campaign manifesto i thought this is a man thats capable of change inside of america as for potential change in the middle east he can also do that if he can bring peace to the area at least this is what we hope
1438621 its been around but im just now seeing this al jazeera report of palestinians in gaza phonebanking for obama i hear that hamas which has endorsed obama has a bit of influence in those parts
1438622 we dont mind actually we like mr obama we hope he will win the election and i do believe he is like john kennedy great man with great principle and he has a vision to change america to make it in a position to lead the world community but not with domination and arrogance
1438623 lobbydelegtes com is a great tool i have contacted all my state delegates for free through email i have come accross another tool from the same company

1438627 how can you be laughing at a time like this
1438628 e il tempo che hai speso per la tua rosa che ha reso la tua rosa cos importante
1438629 se ami qualcuno devi dirglielo subito se no il momento passa passa il tempo e non lo farai pi
1438630 a volte le persone spalancano porte di cui non sapevano nemmeno di avere le kiavi
1438631 prima o poi le cose ritornano indietro e chissa il perch anche le cose piu stupide quando sei innamorata te le ricordi come le piu belle perch la loro semplicit non ha paragoni
1438632 non c niente da fare quando ci manca qualcosa dobbiamo riempire quel vuoto anche se quando ci manca lamore non c nulla che basti
1438633 dolce smarrimento meravigliosa passione dolorosa assenza insopportabile delusione comunque lo si voglia definire lamore una cosa straordinaria inseguito da tutti gli essere umani lamore lunico sentimento ke ci spinge a superare ogni limite
1438634 pi dolce sarebbe la mia morte se all orizzonte vedessi il tuo volto allora 1000 volte vorrei nascere per morirne altrettante
1438635 qualcuno ha detto che nel momento in cui ti soffermi a pensare se ami o meno una persona hai gi la risposta
1438636 avvicin lentamente il suo viso al mio sfiorandomi con la guancia restai assolutamente immobile con lui che mi toccava cos vicino era molto difficile formulare una domanda coerente mi ci volle un minuto buono per riuscire ad aprire bocca di nuovo
1438637 quando si innamorati si comincia collingannare se stessi e si finisce collingannare gli altri
1438638 perch vivere come scalare le montagne non devi guardarti alle spalle altrimenti rischi le vertigini
1438639 si ama davvero una sola volta nella vita anche se non ce ne rendiamo conto
1438640 lamore follia il cuore che batte a duemila la luce che scende di sera in pieno tramonto la voglia di alzarsi al mattino solo per guardarsi negli occhi
1438641 a volte il dolore ti assorbe cos tanto che viene quasi spontaneo alimentarlo
1438642 una volta ogni tanto accadono cose strane una volta ogni tanto un sogno si avvera e lintero disegno della vita si modifica una volta ogni tanto la luna si eclissa
1438643 perplessa ho scoperto con la sua assenza quanto mi fosse ancora presente in tutti questi anni non ha mai smesso neanche per un attimo di essere il mio primo amore
1438644 lamore invece quando non respiri quando assurdo quando ti manca quando bello anche se stonato quando follia quando solo allidea di vederlo con unaltra attraverseresti a morsi loceano
1438645 e uno che quando passa ti giri uno di un altro pianeta lei ha gli occhi che restano in superficie gli occhi di lui sono tuttaltra storia
1438646 quando tinnamori bello essere sciocchi ma il guaio che non te ne accorgi non te ne rendi conto
1438647 sai gi cosa provo ovviamente sono qui il che in due parole significa che preferirei morire piuttosto che rinunciare a te
1438648 lamore irrazionale pi ami qualcuno pi perdi il senso delle cose
1438649 president bush will look awful if he ignores the repression around him and simply applauds the athletes
1438650 this is like when sex was provocative instead of being a given and bernhard still is so much so tom jones cant keep up and looks too slow
1438651 i was trained almost 30 years ago and received a lot of training in psychotherapy
1438652 thanks to the advances of managed care psychotherapy was basically devalued from the perspective of psychiatry all that we were supposed to do was diagnose and consult for pharmacotherapy a lot of the incentives for wanting to be in psychiatry were essentially removed by managed care
1438653 they tend to rely more heavily on self paying patients
1438654 whats happened anecdotally is that some of the residents that i trained with have basically dropped out of insurance plans and are taking cash only business where they can provide the comprehensive services including psychotherapy
1438655 its a clientele thats at a much higher economic level if theyre socially inclined they end up volunteering at community mental health centers
1438656 we know that for depression the combination of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy leads to better outcomes
1438657 i am really offended by this article paris is based upon a catholic faith as are numerous cities in america its very disturbing to see outside religions mix particularly when it comes to history and prominent families it would be a horrid shame to see president sarkozys son intermix he can love whomever he wishes but for gods sake do not change the purity of religious basis in france remember ww2 please remember that the jews financed and provoked every war in history this information is according to numerous men that fought in ww2 its not a matter of being anti semitic it is a matter of preserving other religions and higher moral standards in which many people believe and live by everyday
1438658 an unregulated wall street read cdo s and sivs and morgage sausage is bringing this country to its knees read the names the jewish neocons at dod and the wh particularly the vice presidents office and aipac in congress got their war has no one noticed
1438659 jews today do not suffer from anti semitism at least not the anti semitism that sent them to the gas chambers in europe
1438660 in the usa the jews own and control most of the media i see now the jews trying to do same thing here in europe
1438661 i suggest that all zionists move from europe to israel we dont need your poison here
1438662 this community for me is my beloved community this is not a money making venture i have been running
1438663 the dark comedy pilot directed by oscar winner alexander payne centers on ray jane a well endowed struggling
1438664 also on monday crist said he supported amendment two which would constitutionally ban gay marriage in the state such unions are already
1438665 i haven t heard anything about an upcoming wedding from lindsay but if she was marrying sam i don t think she d ask

1438669 it is very hard some days to know which way is up
1438670 freedom soars on wings outstretched upon the wind of kindness but limitless is the sky when feathers have been strengthened by honest self reflection
1438671 unconditional love does not require sacrificing self pride yes self never
1438672 the secret lies in being brave enough everyday to embrace the truth that whispers constantly from within
1438673 my friendship is eternal my ability to care at all costs is immeasurable my heart soul and spirits depth belong to only one man i am a woman of truth even in my humanness and i will always be perfectly flawed
1438674 since katrina was eight months old she has had trouble getting to sleep so after i had my last baby it all became too much for me
1438675 my partner gave up his job as an car electrician to help out with the family but it was still an ongoing battle and our relationship started to suffer my family was in manchester so i had no one here for support it was very difficult
1438676 gillie completely turned my life around if she hadnt arrived i dont know what would have happened
1438677 she gave me the strength to cope helping me with discipline and teaching me to walk out of the room to calm down
1438678 she also helped with practical things like getting katrina diagnosed
1438679 beforehand we could not get help as we had no idea why she was crying
1438680 our doctor said it was a mental health issue but gillie used her home start support to get us the information we needed
1438681 i am much happier now and so is my family
1438682 we are a non stigmatising charitable organisation for people who just need that little bit of help and dont quite reach the threshold of the statutory services
1438683 but if they dont get that help they will soon reach it we are a preventative charity
1438684 many of the problems here are masked by the wealth of some of the leafier areas so we often miss out on funding
1438685 yet in many areas such as the grahame park and dollis valley estates our needs are the same as in the inner city so we have to work extra hard to get the same attention
1438686 but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side and forthwith came there out blood and water
1438687 greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friends
1438688 and the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are and when i see the blood i will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you
1438689 and you being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh hath he quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us which was contrary to us and took it out of the way nailing it to his cross and having spoiled principalities and powers he made a show of them openly triumphing over them in it
1438690 be sober be vigilant because your adversary your enemy the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour
1438691 the tongue is a fire a world of iniquity sin it defileth the whole body it is set on fire of hell
1438692 but the tongue can no man tame it is an unruly evil full of deadly poison
1438693 if any man among you seem to be religious and bridleth not his tongue but deceiveth his own heart rationalizes this mans religion is vain
1438694 death and life are in the power of the tongue
1438695 but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give account thereof in the day of judgement for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned
1438696 neither murmur ye complain provoke accuse as some of them
1438697 take with you words and turn to the lord say unto him take away all iniquity sin and receive us graciously so will we render the calves of our lips
1438698 by him jesus therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually even when we dont feel like it that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name
1438699 for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling down of strong holds casting down imaginations visualization and every high thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of god and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of christ
1438700 rule over my soul rule over my soul sweet spirit rule over my soul
1438701 for as a prince thou hast power with god and with men
1438702 forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold but with the precious blood of christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot
1438703 many were astonished at thee his visage appearance was so marred more than any man and his form more than the sons of men
1438704 can you see on that tree the love of god
1438705 and they overcame him satan and the system 1 by the blood of the lamb jesus christ 2 and by the word of their testimony courageously professing christ 3 and they loved not their lives unto the death
1438706 heres why were doing this and heres why its different
1438707 economic activity expanded in the second quarter partly reflecting growth in consumer spending and exports
1438708 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities
1438709 the wording is a little strong over inflation but theres really no real change in policy
1438710 i think they are trying to buy time to allow the economy to recover and so that the financials can slowly repair
1438711 they seem more concerned about growth for the rest of this year and id say right now they appear to be dovish for the short term
1438712 tight credit conditions the ongoing housing contraction and elevated energy prices are likely to weigh on economic growth over the next few quarters
1438713 i drive about 35 miles round trip to work every day so this recycle made a good deal on my gas tank

1438715 theyre bringing in everything theyre bringing in scrap iron and steel aluminum brass stainless steel
1438716 just as were speaking a pickup truck is coming across our scale with some farm equipment and some old barbed wire fence
1438717 they get money here and they supplement their income and pay for their food and their fuel and their rent and everything else
1438718 a year or two ago im sure i would have probably just went out to dinner or maybe even went to the movies or something to that effect rather than filling up my tank
1438719 it used to all be for my kids now i use some to pay for gas
1438720 theres a lot of 80 year old farm stuff in the fields from what ive seen people drag in
1438721 we have real collectors with 200 pounds and the little grandmother bringing them down in the back of her cadillac five pounds at a time
1438722 the economy only puts more pressure on people to save money and conserve resources
1438723 people of a certain economic status are willing to turn anything over for cash
1438724 theyre going to pick up the old radiator theyre going to pick up the old swing and bring it to recycle
1438725 eric hobsbawn is the most naturally gifted historian of our time but rested and untroubled he has somehow slept through the terror and shame of the age
1438726 this case highlights our increasing vulnerability to the theft of personal information

1438730 the couch or more generally long term psychoanalytic psychotherapy was for so long a hallmark of the practice of psychiatry it no longer is

1438747 a new jersey mailbox used to send the anthrax was less than 100 yards away from a sorority for which ivins harbored an intense life long obsession
1438748 the mailbox was near a storage closet used by a sorority that ivins used to frequent 27 years ago and by a specific chapter that ivins appeared to have absolutely nothing to do with

1438751 borrowed from a bioweapons lab that fall freeze drying equipment that allows scientists to quickly convert wet germ cultures into dry spores
1438752 the drying device known as a lyopholizer could help investigators explain how he might have been able to send letters containing deadly anthrax spores to u s senators and news organizations
1438753 the device was not commonly used by researchers at the armys sprawling biodefense complex at fort detrick md
1438754 if you google lyophilize and anthrax most of the pages returned are about anthrax vaccines which is what dr ivins was working on at ft detrick
1438755 let me reiterate no matter how good the microbial forensics may be they can only at best link the anthrax to a particular strain and lab they cannot link it to any individual

1438762 il coni farebbe meglio a combattere il doping anzich la libert
1438763 noi ci stiamo preoccupando del doping e non neghiamo nulla agli atleti sui diritti umani non abbiamo messo nessun bavaglio non assolutamente vero
1438764 ci sono delle regole del cio da rispettare bisogna essere sereni realisti ed equilibrati non abbiamo messo nessun bavaglio non vero basta parlare con gli atleti
1438765 sia da stimolo per tutti gli atleti compresi quelli italiani
1438766 dagli atleti azzurri serve un gesto forte ed in questo senso anche disertare linaugurazione sarebbe un segnale importante
1438767 se gli azzurri sono andati fin l evidentemente vogliono sfilare mi sembra un p ipocrita che uno vada l per poi manifestare dissenso
1438768 non abbiamo necessit di inviti particolari perch sanno perfettamente qual il dovere morale cui adempiono nel momento in cui gareggiano
1438769 gli atleti italiani sfileranno regolarmente alla cerimonia di apertura dei giochi e la bandiera italiana sar regolarmente presente sulla pista dello stadio di pechino
1438770 rispetto le opinioni di tutti non c niente di pi autonomo e libero dello sport quindi non mi stupisco che ci siano posizioni diverse anche allinterno dellesecutivo
1438771 le olimpiadi sono una grande festa dello sport che nessuno pu vuole e deve politicizzare non vuole farlo il governo che rispetta le regole del cio che stabilisce che cosa debbono o non debbono fare gli atleti
1438772 il tema dei diritti umani si affronta ogni giorno e non nelle tre settimane dellolimpiade
1438773 deploriamo ogni invito rivolto agli atleti affinch non prendano parte allinaugurazione dei giochi olimpici
1438774 certi politici anche se sono vicini alle mie idee sono incompetenti non capiscono certe cose al di fuori del loro mondo non vedo perch disertare la cerimonia di apertura allora tanto valeva boicottare i giochi e poi al ministro meloni chiedo ma lei diserterebbe loccasione della vita
1438775 per un atleta vivere lapertura dei giochi la cosa pi bella della vita esserci tutto non esserci sarebbe come per un credente rinnegare la propria fede o per un marito fedele arrivare a tradire la moglie

1438778 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1438779 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1438790 we have received a great deal of input from the market this year that transactions are occurring that include these fees and surcharges and currently nags does not publish any corresponding service part numbers that are appropriate for this purpose
1438791 we dont take any position on what costs should be associated with the new numbers but hope that their addition will enable trading partners to more clearly identify these items in their negotiated transactions
1438792 there is no more important issue facing the collision repair industry than steering
1438793 we need to know whats going on around the country to address this issue
1438794 any efforts to re direct refer or otherwise influence the vehicle owner in the choice of repair facility once the vehicle owner has stated they have chosen a repair facility
1438795 the chairman of that committee tends to be more friendly to the insurance industry than to the collision industry
1438796 a deceptive referral practice whereby the consumer is misled into thinking that a particular repair shop facility vendor or supplier must be used
1438797 we believe this bill represents a substantial threat to the way in which we currently do business
1438798 claimants who have chosen a specific auto body shop without adequate information would be denied vital information about shops pre qualified by insurance companies
1438799 the consumer may be under the impression that he or she has no real choice we want to make clear your car your choice
1438800 i am aware of my right to choose the licensed repair shop where the damage to the motor vehicle will be repaired
1438801 if 19 percent is used as the benchmark for the number of insureds who would use drp shops in the absence of steering no more than 19 47ths or approximately 40 percent of all referrals to preferred shops would have gone to those shops without steering
1438802 give me a level playing field and i will keep my customers and attract the new business i need
1438803 i accept some insurer steering to my shop because if i didnt those customers would be steered elsewhere but im all for ending the steering across the board

1438811 when youre in one of these natural areas even though you may be able to hear the city in the background i think most people can tune that out and tune into the natural area that they happen to be in or the park for that matter if you actually take the time to watch its behavior every critter that you encounter is going to be a new experience because its going to do something different so its a never ending joy to be able to observe these things in the heart of the city the knowledge that were coexisting in the same environment is pretty powerful

1438823 the dia research dates from 1976 and shows the dangers were known about over twenty years ago the soviets used the frequencies and intensities used by mobile phones 1800 mhz and 900 mhz as weapons it is a rule of the intelligence community that you hide things in plain view getting the public to accept microwave mind control weapons which affect their behavior under the guise of mobile phones was a stroke of genius getting the public to pay for these microwave mind control devices so their brains and behavior can be damaged to make them more docile and easy to control was pure diabolical genius
1438824 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
1438825 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
1438826 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
1438827 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
1438828 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
1438829 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
1438830 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
1438831 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
1438832 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
1438833 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
1438834 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
1438835 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
1438836 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
1438837 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
1438838 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people
1438839 be the change that you want to see in the world
1438840 you are a child not a weapon you are my child you are my daughter and i love you
1438841 hear me x men no longer am i the woman you knew i am fire and life incarnate now and forever i am phoenix
1438842 but it is true things need not have happened to be true tales and dreams are the shadow truths that will endure when mere facts are dust and ashes and forgot
1438843 it think its largely a commodity price story especially as weve seen oil prices start to look like they are on a downward trend
1438844 i think youre seeing some of that strength reverse as a result youre seeing some weakening in commodity based currencies including the canada
1438845 generally were in an environment where the u s dollar seems to be on a bit of an upswing and thats adding further fuel to this depreciating trend for the canada
1438846 just last week we had the monthly gdp contract again so that made it the third of four months that weve seen the canadian economy sort of shrink
1438847 thats shown that the weakness in the u s economy is having a real impact on canadas growth prospects and thats a also a reason that we started to see a bit of underperformance in the dollar
1438848 over the long term it will make manufacturers a little more competitive
1438849 unfortunately theyre also dealing with a u s economy thats looking very much to be in recession
1438850 if it stays down it probably will relieve some of the pressure on manufacturers and exporters
1438851 they had some type of smoke or odour in the cabin
1438852 the captain elected to declare an emergency and get everybody out of the aircraft via the slides
1438853 and thus far found no evidence of an active fire
1438854 the fact that were working in this pressure cooker that anybody can basically torpedo this process by pulling out of it is whats keeping us together
1438855 we all want an alternative to what the federal government originally proposed i think theres a consensus that there are some real fundamental flaws in it
1438856 so we all know that we can only come up with that alternative if we all keep working together
1438857 in some areas we see very high ambient air emissions and in other areas we see less
1438858 so you may manage areas differently depending on how big a problem you have environmentally
1438859 at the end of the day well have to achieve agreement and it remains to be seen whether the government will find this an acceptable attractive alternative to what theyve already proposed
1438860 its been an unusual spirit of co operation but i think its going to deliver the goods for cleaner air
1438861 its not every day you get a letter from the chemical producers and the sierra club co signed
1438862 did not seek nor obtain my approval before taking its decision
1438863 i know this is going to make me look a wally but
1438864 i was living in a tent and i dont have that much money in prison at least my children have something to eat
1438865 but when a mother is in prison for the murder of the father the lives of these children outside im not sure its a good alternative either
1438866 if i let my daughter go to live with her uncle he may sell her to someone i will never let him sell her
1438867 to whom can i send the children if they go outside
1438868 im worried about them having to spend five more years here while they are sick
1438869 i try to push her but she cant even stand on her own feet
1438870 there is no open place for them to play there is no park they are living with their mothers inside the prison in the room
1438871 if a child is breastfeeding it is necessary to be with the mother but there are some children who are 10 11 13
1438872 if i go outside i can help my sister cook and wash the clothes i can study go to the mosque study the quran and when i come home i can help my sister wash the dishes
1438873 i cant let my children be taken to an orphanage because i have many enemies who may kidnap them
1438874 some of my enemies are even in prison and they ask about me if my children were in an orphanage i would not feel that they were safe

1438901 unfortunately no matter the outcome of this trial this schedule alone may not be enough to ensure that senator stevens has the ability to compete meaningfully in the upcoming election
1438902 senator stevens must be able to campaign albeit limitedly during the trial were venue transferred to alaska senator stevens would have the opportunity to campaign in the evenings and on weekends during the trial
1438903 if they have evidence this thing suggests why didnt they indict bribery
1438904 it suggests they wanted to prosecute in the district of columbia on the false statement charges because they thought it would be easier to get a conviction here
1438905 maybe they didnt want to prosecute the case in alaska because they were afraid the people up there would have been sympathetic to him
1438906 things are going to come out that they never knew about sen stevens
1438907 once the damning evidence becomes public the house of cards begins to fall
1438908 bring charges on what they can actually prove there may be things out there that they didnt charge because its a little squishy bribery cases are exceeding difficult to prove against a politician
1438909 it is entirely unacceptable for members of congress to accept hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of gifts for businesses that theyre helping with their legislative power
1438910 there is actually no explanation that mr stevens can give that is good enough about why it was okay for bill allen to give him 250 000 worth of gifts
1438911 anytime a united states senator a u s congressman or others are charged with intentionally hiding gifts thats a very serious charge those gift rules are there for a reason theyre there to protect the integrity of our system

1438925 a breakthrough for biblical archaeology dramatic proof of the accuracy of the old testament
1438926 its very exciting and very surprising finding something like this tablet where we see a person mentioned in the bible making an everyday payment to the temple in babylon and quoting the exact date is quite extraordinary
1438927 this is a fantastic discovery a world class find if nebo sarsekim existed which other lesser figures in the old testament existed a throwaway detail in the old testament turns out to be accurate and true i think that it means that the whole of the narrative of jeremiah takes on a new kind of power

1438934 the loss of a finger will only render a person 5 impaired this means a labourer who loses one hand would not be regarded as sufficiently injured to claim compensation from the fund
1438935 i think the public is being misled about the so called advantages of the new legislation
1438936 were being told passengers who previously only had a limited claim against the fund would now have unlimited access but they neglect to say that the passenger would still have to prove a 30 disability
1438937 were being told that limited claims fall away but they dont tell us claims for loss of income is limited to r160 000 a year and the fund will only pay out r5 000 for funerals one cant even buy half a coffin for that

1438986 the japanese reporters violated the rules of china by forcing their way into a military area the act was not well justified and they should accept the consequences

1438999 the plane will fly with the light on but for legal reasons
1439000 so we arent sued for gross negligence and borderline genocide when all of our passengers plunge to their firey dooms aboard our vessel of unsuitable standards
1439001 the light is still on and a mechanic is coming to check it out
1439002 this is why we cant put so much water in our fuel
1439003 were going to turn the plane off and turn it back on again like your computers at home
1439004 alright there looks like since we got here 30 minutes earlier than expected were gonna have to wait on the tarmac for our gate

1439024 in that sense i will abide by the decision of this court

1439026 that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1439027 over the next few days the habbush letter continued to be featured prominently in the united states and across the globe
1439028 foxs bill oreilly trumpeted the story sunday night on the oreilly factor talking breathlessly about details of the story and exhorting now if this is true that blows the lid off al qaeda saddam
1439029 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1439030 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1439031 the allegation that the white house directed anyone to forge a document from habbush to saddam is just absurd
1439032 ron suskind makes a living from gutter journalism he is about selling books and making wild allegations that no one can verify including the numerous bipartisan commissions that have reported on pre war intelligence
1439033 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
1439034 ignored the iraq intelligence chiefs accurate disclosure that there were no weapons of mass destruction in iraq intelligence they received in plenty of time to stop an invasion
1439035 they secretly resettled him in jordan paid him 5 million which one could argue was hush money and then used his captive status to help deceive the world about one of the eras most crushing truths that america had gone to war under false pretenses
1439036 operation created by the white house and passed to the cia seems inconsistent with
1439037 intended to influence united states political processes public opinion policies or media
1439038 it is not the sort of offense such as assault or burglary that carries specific penalties for example a fine or jail time
1439039 it is much broader than that it pertains to the white houses knowingly misusing an arm of government the sort of thing generally taken up in impeachment proceedings
1439040 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1439041 in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1439042 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner
1439043 the administration profoundly altered basic democratic ideals of accountability and informed consent
1439044 it should be noted that the intelligence sources who are quoted in this book in no way disclosed any classified information none crossed the line
1439045 tendency of the white house to ignore advice it didnt want to hear advice that contradicted its willed certainty political judgments or rigid message strategies
1439046 was a trained kgb agent who wants you to think hes your friend
1439047 step back in large meetings when they were together like those at the nsc national security council because people were addressing and deferring to cheney cheney said he understood that hed mostly just take notes at the big tables and then he and bush would meet privately frequently to discuss options and action
1439048 complex strategies developed over decades for how to protect a president
1439049 after the searing experience of being in the nixon white house cheney developed a view that the failure of watergate was not the break in or even the cover up but the way the president had in essence been over briefed
1439050 they key was a signaling system where the president made his wishes broadly known to a sufficiently powerful deputy who could take it from there if an investigation ensued or a foreign leader cried foul the president could shrug this was never something hed authorized the whole point of cheneys model is to make a president less accountable for his action cheneys view is that accountability a bedrock feature of representative democracy is not in every case a virtue
1439051 well along in petulance seasoned by a touch of self defensiveness
1439052 moving on its own natural arc the country is in the process of leaving bush his bullying impulse fused permanently with satisfying vengeance in the scattering ashes of 9 11
1439053 the high purpose his angry words carried after the attacks and in two elections since is dissolving with each passing minute
1439054 it is my belief that the bush administration was fixated on iraq and used the 9 11 attacks by al qaida as justification for overthrowing saddam hussein to accomplish this top administration officials made repeated statements that falsely linked iraq and al qaida as a single threat and insinuated that iraq played a role in 9 11 sadly the bush administration led the nation into war under false pretenses
1439055 in defence of the presidency president mbeki must allow an independent body to make an independent assessment of the arms deal
1439056 if the matter refuses to die then a lot of people are going to be implicated
1439057 this matter must be opened up and subjected to a commission of inquiry in the interests of the country people who are implicated should be given a chance to give their side of the story
1439058 did not seek nor obtain my approval before taking its decision

1439060 i do not agree with the sentiment or content of the offensive material especially the bumper sticker that references slave labor it is clear that my actions were juvenile disrespectful and a mistake on my part

1439073 the most unusual thing about booger was that he has a unique ability to reason
1439074 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001
1439075 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammad atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operational link between saddam and al qaida something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade iraq there is no link
1439076 the notion that the white house directed anyone to forge a letter from habbush to saddam hussein is absurd
1439077 we know now that those estimates were wrong but they were the estimates we all relied on
1439078 regardless military force in iraq was used because saddam hussein defiantly failed to comply with the 17 un security council resolutions iraq was subject to
1439079 there was no such order from the white house to me nor to the best of my knowledge was anyone from cia ever involved in any such effort
1439080 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence
1439081 the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
1439082 if they go in the other direction i think theyre probably going to have to start firing people
1439083 george said something like well marine ive got a job for you though you may not like it
1439084 richer remembers looking down at the creamy white house stationery on which the assignment was written
1439085 when it was discussed with me i just thought it was incredible a box checking of all outstanding issues in one letter from one guy
1439086 the white house directed and cia allegedly went along with burying that information so that the war could go ahead as planned this is a complete fabrication in fact the source in question failed to persuade his british interlocutors that he had anything new to offer by way of intelligence concessions or negotiations with regard to the iraq crisis and the british on their own elected to break off contact with him
1439087 there were many iraqi officials who said both publicly and privately that iraq had no wmd but our foreign intelligence colleagues and we assessed that these individuals were parroting the baath party line and trying to delay any coalition attack the particular source that suskind cites offered no evidence to back up his assertion and acted in an evasive and unconvincing manner

1439116 weve found a way to export brazilian sugar in a different shape because it doesnt matter if its ethanol or butanol it can go to the united states and europe and compete in equal conditions with local ethanol

1439134 it cannot be denied that the ground has shifted much since march 8 with a change in state government and with that political leaning it cannot be denied too that some of the policy changes instituted by the dap led penang administration have not gone down well with at least some of the 58 449 registered voters in permatang pauh 69 4 per cent of whom are malays 24 5 per cent chinese and 5 7 per cent indians

1439155 what really impressed me with this property and the rme team was the amount of information that was available to me before i actually clicked on a property i had all my due diligence done for me right there on the website
1439156 we know what its like to follow a real estate agent around with our children in the back seat of the car making multiple offers and being refused multiple times we dont have the time to do that so its wonderful to leverage other peoples time and expertise
1439157 we always knew we should be doing something in real estate for the long term but didnt have a clue as to how to get started after being involved in nouveau riche and attending the training seminars we decided to take the plunge and buy that first property it was kind of scary to click on the button but we knew we had to start somewhere it went very well rme made the whole process go very smoothly
1439158 when you can take advantage of someone else going out and providing the deals the way they do its awesome
1439159 its so easy anyone can do it were looking forward to doing it over and over again

1439171 i havent heard any complaints with many of the ordinance violations its easier for people to come to the village on a monday night than to the courthouse in the middle of the day
1439172 one of the benefits is our managers dont have to go to the cook county courthouse anymore
1439173 i told producer and theatre impresario cameron mackintosh that would be the only way i could sing in front of everyone
1439174 the problem with doing it is that alcohol dehydrates you which isnt very helpful for singing but they said it was alright

1439177 ive always been a believer and practitioner in fundamental fairness and theres an element of that in this issue
1439178 if it appears to be right for eku faculty and staff im going to be for it
1439179 they chose this as their issue and its gone really well
1439180 who are not afraid to question the policies and underlying values that govern our public institutions
1439181 fairness for all is not a radical idea it is a mainstream kentucky value
1439182 the difference between you and most kentuckians is that youre willing to speak up
1439183 equal benefits means more time spent at work can be used on focusing on work and focusing on our students
1439184 there have been so many professors leave eku because they dont wish to enter a tenure track that doesnt offer benefits to their partners and their families
1439185 when professors go elsewhere students lose the chance to learn from their knowledge
1439186 community climate that respects and celebrates the diversity of peoples and seeks to embrace all individuals and prohibits judgment based on race ethnicity religion socioeconomic status gender sexual orientation and physical disability
1439187 this title is nuts the economic crisis has me spending more time worrying than ever
1439188 we pledge that there will be no taxpayer dollars used for it
1439189 we took the attorney generals opinion into account when we developed our new policy
1439190 the new plan does not allow a mother or father to be on the plan but it allows a live in lover to be on the plan
1439191 this undermines marriage because you have to be unmarried to qualify just that in and of itself is discriminatory to marriage its still a domestic partner plan theyre just trying to wiggle through loopholes to make it happen
1439192 when you add people on you are going to increase the risk of that pool and that increases the cost to everyone else
1439193 we welcome the news that the u of l has reaffirmed its commitment to a fair workplace
1439194 the family foundation is proving again that it doesnt live up to its name when it goes to such lengths to prevent families from accessing much needed health coverage
1439195 ekaterina and ronnie were all over each other they were holding hands and ronnie introduced her to everyone as his girlfriend kat its very weird to see she looks like she could be his granddaughter hes obviously very fond of her
1439196 ive seen sex and the city twice already it pushed all the buttons it made me laugh made me cry to be honest i felt quite traumatised by it all i think im quite sensitive when it comes to engaging with other peoples energies and emotions and yet its things like characters in books and films that help me work out my own stuff in life
1439197 in a way seeing the four women in sex and the city and how the story of their lives had moved on reminded me of the spice girls and how weve moved on
1439198 after the success of last years programme we are having it again this year but on a slightly different level
1439199 a number of youths from the sadc region have requested to be included in the programme so this years programme is slightly on a larger scale
1439200 it is everybodys business and continues to be the collective responsibility of each one
1439201 nobody has told me anything at work about the auditions but i suppose management is looking for a co presenter for me i have never had a co presenter since i joined you know
1439202 maybe they are looking for a standby presenter so that in cases of illness someone does the programme on my behalf these are just my assumptions because i do not know anything
1439203 i am not leaving television my contract expires in october i cannot say why they have decided to conduct the auditions i believe i am in good books i am very close to my producer she always tells me people are impressed with my show no one seems to have a problem with me
1439204 even the sponsors are very happy with my show they engage me in their orange parties as master of ceremonies mc they are very happy with me they usually come to the recoding of the show just to enjoy themselves
1439205 we are back again and very independent yvonne and i decide everything if we need someone to help here and there that person is paid for the job he has done we made money with the first album but we got very little for our efforts and that had to stop
1439206 i think she lost her passion because of all the things that were happening to us and she is now a mother and no longer interested which is why i had to take yvonne as fellow lead singer i was also working and got very little time to try anything and now i am supposed to go back to school and i believe i can do both
1439207 when the idea of starting again cropped up i did not have money and i just felt it would not make any sense trying to go that route again when you are recorded for free and made to take a tiny percentage of the proceeds yvonne kept telling me we had to do it again and we got finance from family members to record and release the album
1439208 i knew ruth loved music and it was not from her heart that she wanted to quit as a former dancer i believed so much in our potential together and i kept telling her that we should go to the studio because if we did not then we were just trying to suppress our feelings
1439209 our orientation as africans with regards to gainful employment is a 9 to 5 but i spend over 85 percent of my time working while people are asleep i am at work at the studio communicating with their dreams my inspiration mostly comes at night when its quiet and the landscape is not polluted by noise and movement
1439210 seems like yesterday when we started this we put our souls and hearts in it arts living in gods children mommy raised me right but its hip hop that saved my life
1439211 you know how long ive been doing this jerry this is like from hell to fame it says that people are beginning to take notice its a motivating gesture that says keep doing it this is just the beginning
1439212 even though the other awards need to increase their prizes just getting the certificate and being recognised for our work shows that people appreciate us and this is great it encourages us to aim higher

1439245 i do also know how the sciences in general claim to serve us in our lives but what i have definitely not done is to delve deeply into them i have fashioned no sustained intercourse with any solid book except and here follows a vivid depiction of poetry effectiveness cleanthes said just as the voice of the trumpet rings out clearer and stronger for being forced through a narrow tube so too a saying leaps forth much more vigorously when compressed into the rhythms of poetry striking me then with a livelier shock

1439251 by ramping up adverse market fees by 25 basis points for all borrowers and then crediting llpas 25 basis points for some subset of borrowers the effect of fannies change is a net wash

1439257 hes worked really hard and hes done a great job
1439258 hes got a good feel for the game hes got a good knack in pass defense too of finding zones bodying people up i think hes a young guy that is learning each and every week out there and he really did give us a good boost on saturday on the show the other night we had a couple of clips of him on back to back to back plays making plays for us i think hes a kid that is getting a little better each and every week
1439259 i feel it was god given and i want to thank him for it but it was an opportunity for me to show that i can play it showed that the coaches trust me
1439260 i always thought i could play good but i know i can play better

1439264 ive seen some promise you can tell they are getting better every day at every practice
1439265 i think the defense is going to break out and have a big year im not thinking about what i will do individually my individual goals are to be a leader as a linebacker and help our team reach our team goals we want to win more games a lot more games

1439299 the panel welcomes the commitment of us 10 billion to support food aid and measures to increase agricultural input as a necessary first step more needs to be done however to increase the supply of food to the worlds most vulnerable citizens and immediate measures must be taken to relax export restrictions on commodities such as rice
1439300 the panel welcomes the g8 leaders commitment to the conclusion of an ambitious balanced and comprehensive doha agreement as wto negotiations enter this crucial period all parties need to understand that the attainment of the millennium development goals rest in large part on the ability of the continent to trade its way out of poverty
1439301 the success in supporting african development will not only result in tangible benefits for her people but ensure a more secure and prosperous future for the world for g8 leaders helping africa to help itself is not a question of altruism it is a matter of self interest

1439327 im trying to not think about the fact that she is going to be gone its just so surreal in itself thinking about getting my high school junior ready for a dorm
1439328 i didnt think he would ever want to go there hes so popular and they dont have football or wrestling two sports that hes lettered in
1439329 and i didnt want him living away from home but im glad i didnt throw it out i was surprised at how excited he was about it
1439330 at first i had a lot of anxiety about him going away
1439331 i woke up monday morning and my stomach was in knots and i just felt like i was going to throw up
1439332 thats been an adventure educating him on how to do his laundry
1439333 i bet some things are going to come out discolored
1439334 im just excited to go and see what its going to be like
1439335 i hope to go in there and keep my good grades going and hopefully get a scholarship and find out what i want to do after high school

1439346 yeah my wife nags me all the time not allowed to do this not allowed to say that
1439347 i know what you mean mines always on at me to listen to her and be more considerate and to stop making sexist remarks
1439348 i got to try but its bloody hard work why should we have to make all the effort
1439349 exactly its not as if theres an incentive like a few extra blow jobs or something mine complains about me coming here with you lot but shes driven me to hey check it out wouldnt mind having a go on her

1439362 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face
1439363 it will take nothing less than a complete transformation of our economy
1439364 anybody who says that we can achieve energy independence without using and increasing these existing energy resources either doesnt have the experience to understand the challenge that we face or isnt giving the american people some straight talk
1439365 has merit in terms of just a short term effect on prices
1439366 i offer no suggestion it will make a long term impact on the fact that demand worldwide is going up while supply is flatlined
1439367 he sees more drilling as the answer to all of our energy problems and like them hes found a receptive audience in the very same oil companies that have blocked our progress for so long in fact he raised more than one million dollars from big oil just last month
1439368 after one president in the pocket of big oil we cant afford another
1439369 were not going to achieve energy independence by inflating our tires
1439370 because it is finite at some point it will run out
1439371 the emphasis on our farm tour is to get the children to taste the different fruits and vegetables that we are growing at the particular time
1439372 we all know that there is absolutely no better way to get students involved than with a hands on learning experience ive heard many a child tell their parents that they want to be a farmer when they grow up while they are at the farm
1439373 many farmers all over the country now have housing developments right next to production fields whether it be a dairy ranch or a vegetable farm the more that our neighbors know about our operations and understand our issues that we deal with the less fear and anxiety they will have and the more peaceful we may coexist
1439374 for the most part teachers who attend this conference understand the importance of teaching their students about agriculture but most of them have limited knowledge of the daily lives of farmers and ranchers
1439375 we wanted to give these educators a glimpse into what it means to be an avocado grower or a dairy producer for example we wanted to introduce them to real people who make this industry work day in and day out and allow them to put faces and names to the term farmer in order to build a better understanding of the lessons they are teaching in their classrooms
1439376 weve laid a solid foundation for the study of agriculture to thrive in our classrooms
1439377 i will continue to build on this because our students must be keenly aware of this industrys impact on our state and how it affects their health fitness and in a word their lives
1439378 i would absolutely be on board and willing to assist to get increased ag education in my daughters school
1439379 those of us in the industry understand that if we dont get the word out we will face a shortage of people to carry on the farms and ranches that are so vital to our economy we need to get young people interested early right now you dont hear kids say they want to grow up and be farmers i would say thats probably not even on the radar screen
1439380 we need to get the word out and show youngsters what agriculture is all about you dont see video games about farming or ranching its not a profession with the glitz and glamour and instant gratification that so many in this society have come to expect while rural life seems great when were older the younger kids long for other things
1439381 i am concerned about ageing odour and know there are anti ageing odour products but have not bought them myself
1439382 japan is becoming more of a cleanliness and odourless society and the name kareishu fits right in with that trend of the times
1439383 more japanese men are becoming concerned about their smell and so the need for anti body odour products is growing

1439449 do you think a farm to college program is plausible at asu
1439450 would it be possible to have a specialized section of asu that sells just local food

1439453 this opportunity might benefit me down the road in my quest to make the a1 team but my sole purpose for this decision is to be better prepared for next year with iowa state it was tough sitting out and not being able to play
1439454 the games have been fun so far but the competition has not been that great
1439455 that is why it will be really good for me to play on the a2 team because we will be playing against great teams

1439457 i think the standards have been tightened and i think that credit card issuers are quicker to change i e increase your rates
1439458 generally in normal times if you look at the hierarchy of what gets paid its credit cards that tend to be the last thing if the going gets rough
1439459 but you really have to deserve it the days of just giving someone a platinum credit card seems to be not necessarily gone but is just being put on hold for quite some time
1439460 i think out of your control are any business decisions that they make on a blanket level in regards to the fact that theyre doing poorly as publicly owned companies or anything along those lines those are what we call the market conditions type of repricing
1439461 what can you control you can definitely control whether you dont pay late whether your payment gets there on time
1439462 the folks who are unfortunately going through these types of experiences with default rates lower credit limits higher interest rates issuers closing accounts down on them suspending helocs these are generally reserved for people who either are on the riskier side of prime or are just flat out nonprime and the lender just doesnt want to do business with them anymore
1439463 step one is to make sure that you do in fact still have the same terms that you had originally
1439464 you dont want to all of a sudden start revolving a balance just for the heck of it because you want to put more money toward your 401 k or put more money toward other investments or stick more money in savings if you have the ability to continue to pay in full its probably a good idea to continue to do so
1439465 what are the local resources that we could use for a farm to college program at asu

1439474 nosotros entendemos que celco trabaja de esta forma o sea sin ninguna capacidad de control de sus propios procesos esto est consignado en un amplio prontuario ambiental de celco que hemos concentrado en un documento y en cada una de sus plantas basta con decir que la planta de licancel es la tercera en la que se encuentran ductos ilegales ya han muerto al menos dos personas en faenas de la empresa y es la nica responsable de un accidente nuclear en el pa s donde el principal afectado se encuentra abandonado por la compa a
1439475 los llamados de la presidenta michelle bachelet a que celco desarrolle su labor de forma responsable carecen de sustento en este caso pues celco a la luz de estos problemas constantes deja en evidencia que sus procesos distan bastante de dar garant as reales y no van en la direcci n correcta m s que solucionar problemas espec ficos el gobierno deber a impulsar la producci n limpia integral en las plantas de celulosa que operan en el pa s
1439476 tenemos dos ductos uno de succi n de agua y otro de vertimiento de riles y hay otro ducto de agua lluvia

1439481 al no fiscalizarse los permisos ambientales la empresa como en el caso de celco presenta un proyecto y construye otro sara larrain ambientalista ex candidata presidencial
1439482 el sistema de fiscalizaci n est n d bil que rara ves las empresas son fiscalizada por temas ambientales
1439483 normalmente sobre todo las grandes empresas incorporan las multas o las infracciones en sus costos de operaciones
1439484 la empresa prefiera pagar la multa y continuar con la situaci n de contaminaci n
1439485 sin embargo todav a no hay casos de c rcel en chile porque el delito ecol gico no esta tipificado y se nota solo en lo que va del a o hay 118 casos de contaminaci n del agua que se investigan
1439486 last week i communicated to senator obama and his presidential campaign my firm intention to remain in the united states senate where i believe i am best equipped to serve the people of virginia and this country
1439487 under no circumstances will i be a candidate for vice president
1439488 if drafted i will not run nominated i will not accept and if elected i will not serve
1439489 so i dont know how more crystal clear i can be
1439490 well go into every one of those factories in the coming weeks and months
1439491 well the 30 cents an hour we pay them is more than theyll get anywhere else
1439492 nike has contracted with the hytex factory for 14 years and has had
1439493 if we were just to cut the factory for these kinds of allegations we cant make sure that any improvements are made in these workers lives
1439494 look at how a man is filling this traditionally female role
1439495 of all the condescending dismissive and factually incorrect accusations used by concern trolls or hostile trolls to attempt to silence shame or in some other way discourage feminists from
1439496 these women whine and nag and hover to control their husbands and children nannies do all of this when mom isnt around dont they
1439497 since these numbers are unambiguous and readily available why would republicans continue to advocate for drilling
1439498 because for years i thought what was good for the country was good for general motors and vice versa
1439499 after the credits skeletors head pops up from the lake and says
1439500 im starting to worry about whether we are going to have a team ready for the start of the season because nani is suspended anderson is at the olympics and i doubt if we will get rooney fit after the virus he has had
1439501 he picked it up in nigeria and its not a nice one its 12 days to the season starts and hes not been able to train
1439502 while you are trying to get a business off the ground all your options to pay back your debt are nonexistent without a steady income flow you need to be careful not to rob peter to pay paul which is the most common comment i hear from clients meaning dont pay your visa with your mastercard
1439503 a lot of people dont even know what their policies are
1439504 obviously the first thing you want to do is make sure everyone involved is ok
1439505 even if the other person says ill take care of you ive got a brother in law with a body shop that can fix your car you still want to call
1439506 you may need to change your term policy based on your income
1439507 it is a good idea to insure yourself and your family for 10 times the amount of your income if a spouse stays home with the kids be sure to insure that spouse too
1439508 once youve retired you know what your financial situation is going to be you know what bills youre going to have and the kind of cash youll need
1439509 once you are out of debt with your house paid for your kids grown and you have been investing in mutual funds and toward retirement for the past 20 years you will be self insured
1439510 if it has already served its purpose and is no longer needed then theres no reason to make the monthly or yearly payment on it
1439511 a 30 year old person can buy a 125 000 whole life policy for 100 a month that same person can buy a 20 year term policy for 7 a month and invest the remaining 93
1439512 the rate of return is historically low on whole life and universal life policies it makes more sense to invest the money in a good growth stock mutual fund
1439513 one couple the husband said to me ive always heard that you cant afford to buy as much insurance as you need and i said look we just did a 2 5 million term policy quote and its something like 100 i think thats pretty affordable
1439514 its not a huge multiple of income but its going to give them a year to recover should something happen
1439515 for the same reason the idea was good for barack it is good for mccain
1439516 mccain wants to stay in iraq until no more americans are getting killed no matter how long it takes and how many americans get killed achieving that goal that is the goal of not getting any more americans killed and once that goal is achieved well stay
1439517 its vitally important to relate your pace to the culture
1439518 you have to have the patience to deal with different systems and if youre an american who doesnt know the language everything is going to take you 50 percent longer
1439519 explains how this method of calculating interest expense acts as a prepayment penalty
1439520 if youve been foreclosed on and you have a lien against your home or if youre in financial trouble due to general economic conditions and you arent able to pay your assessments that creates some major problems for the association
1439521 some associations are assessing 10 000 20 000 or 30 000 per unit the buildings are 30 or 40 years old and they need renovations some owners are defaulting and then thats another 10 000 20 000 or 30 000 that the rest of the homeowners need to make up
1439522 awareness is always better than uncertainty dont just stand on the sidelines and condemn and criticize
1439523 the best option is to be as frugal as possible and if there is still a shortfall they should do the one thing that associations can do which is to assess the owners as necessary
1439524 the bush administration the mexican government and much of the diplomatic community have warned of an international backlash if the execution goes forward without a hearing on medellins claim that he was denied an opportunity to contact the mexican consulate after his arrest
1439525 we respectfully request that texas take the steps necessary to give effect to the avena decision with respect to the convictions and sentences addressed therein
1439526 i am further advised that if any individual under texas custody and subject to avena has not previously received a judicial determination of his claim of prejudice under the vienna convention and seeks such review in a future federal habeas proceeding the state of texas will ask the reviewing court to address the claim of prejudice on the merits

1439549 but its not like i could not do the things i had to do
1439550 theres a significant number of folks in jacksonville who either have no insurance or inadequate insurance who go to the emergency room for all of their care
1439551 were adding more and more products to the low end of the ramp
1439552 we also hear from employers who dont realize these caps are part of what makes up their insurance policy
1439553 you can go through 1 million in two or three surgeries health care costs are inflating rapidly
1439554 i think the market has demanded the caps to go up
1439555 the purpose of the cap is to keep insurance affordable for people who need it
1439556 but youre taking away the benefit from people who need it the most to keep it affordable for people who might not need it at all
1439557 commissioner poizners backroom deal with allstate effectively pardoned them for past misdeeds

1439563 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1439564 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1439565 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
1439566 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has
1439567 so how you can announce an agreement without other parties being involved in it escapes me
1439568 a blind one legged monkey could now orchestrate these regular farragoes
1439569 we took these risks and decisions in the name of peace and progress
1439570 northern ireland is crying out for bright young politicians with new ideas and fresh thinking yet how would they ever get a foot on the political ladder when every run of that ladder is occupied by greedy politicians with dual and even triple mandates
1439571 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1439572 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1439573 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1439574 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1439575 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers

1439706 pollsters like to have data from the past then say what can we expect
1439707 you cant look at 2004 or 2006 and say this is the way things are going to look because participation of young and african american voters is so high this year its a huge question if you end up having a tight race and youre off a point or two underestimating or overestimating the democratic vote
1439708 there are a lot of indications from a variety of sources this will be a close election and the margins will be very close in many places that makes pollsters uneasy
1439709 the general election still is four months away no vice presidential candidates have been selected and the issues havent really been articulated for a large percentage of voters
1439710 the opinion makers an insider exposes the truth behind the polls
1439711 if you consider 30 to 40 percent of the public only occasionally follows the news they will be heavily influenced by the way the poll questions are phrased
1439712 there are a lot of little things that might not affect their preferences but will influence what they say
1439713 new hampshire certainly was scary to pollsters but i just havent seen a consistent enough pattern of understating support for hillary clinton or magnitude of error to make me think race is the reason
1439714 it was a case where pollsters underestimated black voter turnout even in a place with a predominantly african american population
1439715 if cell phone use continues to grow and skew young we and others will be forced to do more of that
1439716 it gets to the point where its like telemarketing particularly in small states because there are a lot of media organizations and private organizations out there calling some of the same people
1439717 the phone has made it much cheaper than flying people to a location and making them go door to door but you still need good interviewers and a good sample
1439718 most independents dont vote all the time but when they do they tend to really be undecided going into the final days of an election
1439719 many are susceptible to some kind of influence from media coverage and past surveys showed one in six didnt vote the way they said they would a few days earlier so a lot of the answers are still out
1439720 there are only two ways to study an election reliably and accurately work hard with phone polls or use the internet with a representative sampling
1439721 given the economic circumstances with big media companies squeezing their polling units im expecting business as usual its potentially a missed opportunity because this is a remarkable election season and someone should be collecting quality data
1439722 were good at measuring a lot of things but the trickiest is measuring racial attitudes
1439723 a lot of pollsters havent specialized in it or taken it seriously and now have to believe or live with what respondents way you need to identify all the factors that might push a persons vote and devise questions to tap them
1439724 generally theres a relationship between age and voting people who are less likely to be settled in a place who are harder to find in telephone surveys have not been a big focus for pollsters this year with obama having traction with young people well have to phrase questions new ways to learn whether theyll behave differently

1439729 they asserted however that the sum and substance of their fault or error had been that they were accustomed to meet on a fixed day before dawn and sing responsively a hymn to christ as to a god and to bind themselves by oath not to some crime but not to commit fraud theft or adultery not falsify their trust nor to refuse to return a trust when called upon to do so when this was over it was their custom to depart and to assemble again to partake of food but ordinary and innocent food even this they affirmed they had ceased to do after my edict by which in accordance with your instructions i had forbidden political associations

1439779 every one who shoots down negroes in the streets burns negro school houses and meeting houses and murders women and children by the light of their own flaming dwellings calls himself a democrat every new york rioter in 1863 who burned up little children in colored asylums who robbed ravished and murdered indiscriminately in the midst of a blazing city for three days and nights calls himself a democrat in short the democratic party may be described as a common sewer and loathsome receptacle into which is emptied every element of treason north and south every element of inhumanity and barbarism which has dishonored the age

1439781 movies in the parks films series never seen it but im totally in love with the whole movies in the parks concept too cute really honestly this makes up for the fact that the brookline business community allowed both a qdoba and a motherfucking panera into coolidge corner which used to be famous for its encouragement of locally based independent businesses like the coolcor theatre or brookline booksmith grr i guess i do live in corporate yuppiesville huh the movie starts at 8 p m so get there early if you wanna burn one before the bropo show up to monitor the whole event and duh its free and all ages however i will not be there because i will on the opposite end of brookline at the gasp gallery for what should be a very very entertaining show featuring paral lel a well known avante electro duo from france thats them playing some crazy rave party in lyons and nsythesis let me just say that im a huge fan of the gasp gallery and their musical offshoot memory 9 was absolutely incredible the space is so nice and so accessible being about a block and a half from the brookline hills stop on the green lines d train heres an excerpt from what the people over at sonic arts had to say about their incoming guests is a duo composed of two artists slush and praktisch slush built his own sound by becoming an expert dj in electro breakbeat and breakcore while praktisch got into more subtle sounds like post rock and click n cuts atmospheres on stage paral lel gathers these influences into a dynamic and lively electro which is based on organic melodies that leave enough room for powerful breaks american pierce warnecke and frenchman romain are the two humans that comprise this nth synthesis two geeks from different backgrounds both captivated by technology and intelligent machines throughout their work they draw a universe of catchy melodies chopped beats and distorted fractals an alchemy right on the border of chaos like the thermodynamic triple point between three phases sound emotion and images influences as diverse as brian eno plaid klaus schulze philip k dick or maurice g dantec fill their simple human minds

1439786 it doesnt make me laugh at all sometimes theres someone you may be trying to become friends with or you may even be thinking about going out with the person but because of all that it can never get off the ground thats just a nuisance

1439800 theres not many jobs where you make this kind of money
1439801 he finishes every run within his individual drills i see the guy working hard to get better
1439802 i think the guy shows up each day and he has a purpose when he practices
1439803 thats always going to be in the back of some peoples minds can the guy make it
1439804 hes an unbelievable player but its just keeping him on the field its like one of those things you have to show me you have to go out and give me a full season i dont think anybodys worried about it but its just a matter of him going out and getting it done
1439805 i got a whole bag of tricks to stay focused
1439806 for myself and ricky the positive competition is always good
1439807 sometimes its hard to tell if barack obama is running for president of the united states or mr universe
1439808 when white people are invited to think about obamas physical appearance the principal attribute theyre likely to dwell on is his dark skin consequently any reference to obamas other physical attributes cant help coming off as a coy walk around the barn
1439809 my opinion of pat has changed over the years i used to think he was truly a man of the people but the longer he has been mayor the less i think of him as with most cities charlotte has three political parties dem rep and chamber of commerce pat is definitely the puppet of the coc here what is good for business is good for charlotte and pat very personable guy he has gotten a bunch of dems in these parts to vote for him but i dont trust him

1439812 soumah got caught in the internal skulduggery between the various ethnic and security factions of the guinean regime as each seeks to align with various corporate multinationals operating in the country ahead of the expected demise of conte
1439813 in conjunction with its partner in the project international finance corporation rio tinto is currently studying the issues raised in the correspondence
1439814 rio tinto negotiated and executed the simandou mining concession in full transparency with the guinean government and is currently in discussion with relevant ministers with a view to resolving any issues
1439815 is just one many vehicles for the various competing factions within the guinean political system to flex their muscles
1439816 however the ultimate winner of this internal battle is unlikely to be known for some months so its too early to write off rios interest in guinea
1439817 given that cisco has become largely a revenue growth story the primary risk to the stock involves the global economy
1439818 there cannot be a rule that says if you have a representative on the board you cant make a bid for the company
1439819 we all know that the directors have an obligation to do what they have to do to make the deal as good as possible
1439820 effectively used a pill can result in a higher price
1439821 if used improperly it can have a devastating effect by driving off an otherwise willing buyer
1439822 given whats happened to this point i would seriously doubt he would push away a potential buyer
1439823 all the production workers are going to get called back
1439824 we are retooling our facility to handle all the motor homes we are moving out here to oregon from indiana
1439825 we need to go into our plants and get the lines ready for the motor homes we are bringing in
1439826 the markets have been soft on the motorized side of the business and were adjusting our business structure to match market demand
1439827 all the production workers are going to get called back
1439828 if you want to know what happened or what transpired blow by blow or what words were said im sorry youre not going to know
1439829 its private its between us and its not a big deal and its not the first time it ever happened and it wont be the last
1439830 you never want this stuff to happen but who cares
1439831 we lost tonight thats the worst thing that happened the other stuffs forgotten its not surprising when were all competing were all trying real hard and we get frustrated its going to happen everybody gets to see it oh well
1439832 right now were so young and inexperienced that were setting our roster as we go it probably will be changing every day
1439833 the reputation of this team has been damaged no question
1439834 i dont think its beyond repair and i dont think the reputation has been ruined but certainly it has taken some hits
1439835 i was kind of all over the place with my driver and i wasnt putting as well as i would have liked
1439836 i was kind of on a bogey train for a while
1439837 if those three putts didnt happen it would have been a great round i feel like im right in it and i can play well tomorrow
1439838 i knew i was going to be nervous but i was surprised at how long it took me to relax
1439839 by the end of the round i felt like i was a lot more calm
1439840 some parts were fun and some were not as fun it was hard to concentrate i didnt have my best with two hours sleep and all that craziness
1439841 it was a little more exciting more than i wanted today but what can you do
1439842 i struggled at the beginning but i came back and started swinging better
1439843 it was early but im glad its over and done for the day the course was playing longer in the morning but by the end of the round the course was drying up a little bit
1439844 that little putt is going to haunt me all night
1439845 its nice to be able to shoot a low number i came out in my practice rounds and i struggled i was worried but today i was like you know what just let it all go it doesnt matter once you get on a roll and you get going you play with what you got
1439846 college golf is tough theres a lot of expectations a lot of pressure
1439847 when it came down to postseason pac 10s regionals and nationals and now im being sat that was a humbling experience yeah it lit my fire but thats fine i understand i didnt have a good season so be it but im not going to let it hurt me for next year it only made me work harder
1439848 im out there playing with the ncaa champion and im like i can still beat her
1439849 shes good but you know what im just as good
1439850 most of the innings i felt i had to battle quite a bit
1439851 for some reason we play really well against these guys
1439852 and when cliff lee is on the mound you just follow his lead
1439853 about a year ago people thought iraq was lost and hopeless people were saying lets get out of there it doesnt matter to our national security iraqs changed a lot
1439854 if its a law enforcement matter that means you react after the crime i think its important to stop the crime from happening in the first place
1439855 the united states today and tomorrow must stay on the offense and keep the pressure on this enemy and bring em to justice so they dont hurt the american citizen again
1439856 ive been through it some people leave some dont i aint leaving if it aint a category four or five im staying here
1439857 weve probably doubled the wheat production weve had in the past
1439858 weve always used it as a rotation crop but this year weve been able to bring it up to a frontline crop
1439859 if every garage mechanic and driver knew the details and was involved in the planning of the attack it never would have happened
1439860 you must decide the weight and significance if any such statements deserve
1439861 nothing is guaranteed in life but i dont see it any other way but im playing this season
1439862 im feeling good about where i am in my rehab im on track things are going well im steady making progress
1439863 can you imagine going five or six weeks not having the power to lift your own leg youve got to depend on people 24 7
1439864 my mind was gone here i go from walking and running just doing the normal to now i cant even move my leg it was tough to deal with
1439865 as soon as it happened i knew it was bad i mean severe severe pain
1439866 right now i know it doesnt look good theres a lot of things being said me i just zone all that stuff out and show up to work and keep grinding ive always been the type im going to push as hard i can and lets see what happens
1439867 if things dont turn out i can always look myself in the eye and say i gave it everything i had
1439868 it was an asinine decision and ill move forward better than i probably have ever had to its the first time in my life that i really havent forgiven myself
1439869 people were running down but didnt know where to go so a lot of people were lost on the mountain on the wrong side wrong route and then you have a big problem and then things like that happen
1439870 everybody was fighting for himself and i still do not understand why everybody were leaving each other
1439871 its like buying a car a lot of people think the price is set but its not
1439872 if i could sell a house in two weeks rather than six months id be more willing to negotiate
1439873 real estate commissions are determined between the sellers and their agents but the best advice i can give home sellers is that it is far more important to focus on an agents performance especially in todays housing market
1439874 we have strengthened security in all olympic venues and in the olympic village we are well prepared to deal with any kind of threat
1439875 tired exhausted like he must have been flying around a long time
1439876 had one of those buddy can you spare me something looks on its faces
1439877 we feel like were keeping someone elses property but if we return it we might be signing the birds death warrant
1439878 i might be jumping to conclusions but i wonder if it wasnt treated very well at home and so found paradise here
1439879 she told us theyre like greyhounds who wont chase a rabbit anymore
1439880 while the hearts of the family may be good keeping the bird is wrong why not steal some chickens who are soon to be slaughtered
1439881 what would the pigeon want divine what the bird would prefer its not the same as returning a lost set of car keys or a misplaced wallet we are talking about a living feeling creature and any legal claim is superseded by the morality of returning an animal to a situation where it is likely to be killed
1439882 the majority of the time the owner will want the pigeon back
1439883 its exaggerating to think that the birds are going to get euthanized sure in some cases if they have a broken wing and are unable to perform but usually not
1439884 sometimes real young ones just get lost i lost one in sacramento and it took a month to get home
1439885 if the response is we dont want it back well kill it if it comes back maybe theres another option for it
1439886 acts of violence and intimidation such as these are unacceptable and they continue a troubling pattern seen at ucla and other uc campuses that should be repugnant to us all
1439887 these acts threaten not only our academic researchers and their families but the safety and security of neighbors in our communities as well
1439888 parents have to navigate a minefield of calories fat and salt to find them
1439889 because they are so well disguised as toys novelty lighters have children literally playing with fire
1439890 you have these first responders weighing in and thats a strong coalition thats what swung me on the issue
1439891 we have no way to know if federal legislation will be successful or how comprehensive it will be
1439892 what were ultimately working for is a national ban either for the import or the manufacture of these devices
1439893 these are the best santana 20 sailors in the nation
1439894 weve tried three times to have the national championship here since 1996 and this time the army corps of engineers smiled upon us
1439895 this particular regatta i think is unique because weve got a team from mexico city here and weve got a team from canada here as well as oklahoma and california
1439896 what it means to eugene and this yacht club is it brings a lot of people together
1439897 the neat thing about the santana 20 is it can be a family boat too
1439898 its inexpensive enough you can pick one up for 2 000 and be as competitive as somebody else in the right wind conditions its hot shot sailors and professionals but its also just the regular guy having fun
1439899 i dont know of another sport where you can spend some time with the best racers on the planet basically and be in the same piece of water with them itd be like your kid playing little league with cal ripken jr
1439900 a little bit of artistry and romance and technical knowledge all rolled into one
1439901 its a very harmonious sport where you work with mother nature people who do well in races work well with the wind that mother nature gives them
1439902 its very strategic theres a lot of math and im kind of a math nut its a big chessboard out there
1439903 sailing is a lot of fun but in a good wind you need strength
1439904 because they are so well disguised as toys novelty lighters have children literally playing with fire
1439905 you have these first responders weighing in and thats a strong coalition thats what swung me on the issue
1439906 were trying to make sure all road users are in compliance with the law
1439907 we get requests from the bicyclist and pedestrian community about drivers behavior and we get calls from the motor vehicle community about bicyclists and pedestrians
1439908 id say were using a holistic approach to tackle the issue because we believe that all the road users have to do a better job following the law
1439909 thats the one thing that strikes fear in the hearts of fire managers
1439910 instead of catching them at a quarter of an acre youre catching them at 20 acres if the system is overwhelmed we have a potential for sizable fires
1439911 we havent ordered a move up yet but are prepared to do so
1439912 i cant follow through or get into my throws or anything
1439913 maybe the best guy with the ball in his hands of anybody on our football team
1439914 its disappointing simply because we needed to see him develop as a passer hopefully its only going to be a day if that
1439915 this wasnt full pads but wed done so much over the summer that was full speed
1439916 if my knee could make it through that ill be fine out there on the field i made it through the stuff in summer so i wasnt even thinking about that
1439917 i missed a couple passes got a little too antsy but its the first day
1439918 i may not have been as productive as the last couple games of last season but that was my first really extensive reps with the full offense last season i didnt really get reps until the sun bowl practices so i was almost starting from square one again
1439919 was pleased really for a first practice i thought the kids were really sharp and focused
1439920 it was fast paced i love it this summer helped tremendously knowing the plays timing on routes just rapport with the fellas im not completely lost out here
1439921 weve done it in the past i think with quite a bit of success
1439922 but its not necessarily something that we choose to do
1439923 we heard this is a great biking town and only after being here did we hear its a great bike thieving town too
1439924 the details are being worked out with the doctors this week but the tentative plan is for radiation and chemotherapy
1439925 we heard this is a great biking town and only after being here did we hear its a great bike thieving town too
1439926 we heard this is a great biking town and only after being here did we hear its a great bike thieving town too
1439927 i think downtown is close enough that we can walk there from here
1439928 were excited to announce twin skies our first major project since creating neopets and a much more ambitious undertaking that aims to change the way gamers of all ages play and socialize in mmos
1439929 twin skies technology and design will allow players to access the game from anywhere and in any way they choose the immersive world advanced technology and accessible gameplay will be fun for gamers young and old casual and hardcore alike
1439930 they didnt mention that in the 2am infomercial i watched
1439931 its a good chunk of change we believe it will start turning lively into another community park like willamalane park
1439932 splash lively park swim center is already a regional draw and this will help draw even more groups
1439933 shift the burden rather than changing the amount of revenue
1439934 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early e sdrq she said
1439935 because it was so foggy i couldnt see any smoke plumes
1439936 its a good chunk of change we believe it will start turning lively into another community park like willamalane park
1439937 is already a regional draw and this will help draw even more groups
1439938 if you look at the growth it is in the east area
1439939 the growth thats occurring out in the thurston area has played a major part in not only moving us ahead but in our grant application
1439940 o line was fun but d line is where i should be i fit there perfect
1439941 im going to prove it this year that defense is where i should stay
1439942 we all deal with this same cyclical nature of this industry its not a pleasant thing
1439943 we could take 20 to 30 to 40 people depending on their fit to the solarworld roles and their willingness to relocate
1439944 we have no statements related to the future of the company yet
1439945 the idea is if they come here they have job openings
1439946 a lot of these are new positions because were expanding
1439947 i heard the plane above and thought gosh its awfully low and awfully early e sdrq she said
1439948 because it was so foggy i couldnt see any smoke plumes
1439949 you wont see concrete buildings here im not a concrete high rise builder its not what we do we want to build stuff that the community is going to like to live in number one hopefully that means its nice to look at
1439950 i have never built a product over four stories and i will not do it here
1439951 ive been looking at eugene for a while for something to do
1439952 im not a duck but i do come down all the time to the football games i just love eugene i have a lot of good friends down here
1439953 i know there were more well financed groups that were bidding on this i believe it was a relationship i was able to form with the folks at peacehealth they saw we were going to do a good job for eugene
1439954 we have some issues on some sites with neighbors and we go sit down and meet with them if it doesnt work out it doesnt work out
1439955 i cant come in and say heres what were doing
1439956 we just decided wed let somebody else go through that zone change process themselves
1439957 its an expense and its time and we of course had other things that we were working on
1439958 right down the middle of the fairway is our goal
1439959 four stories is pretty high and weve already got willamette oaks in the area if the city allows this all over the outlying areas were not going to be a beautiful city any more
1439960 i have had to take a defensive posture because i have absolutely no idea what he intends to do obviously he has chosen not to share with anyone outside his organization i dont have the information i need to determine what my view is until i understand whats going on thats a very simple thing
1439961 if theyd called me upfront and said heres our concerns we want to make sure youre addressing our concerns through the process e ssrq we would have loved to sit down and work that out up front with them
1439962 that slickly disguises their plans to raise taxes and increase spending
1439963 i have a tendency when i take a lot of time off to play well
1439964 i have to say i no longer have a golfers tan im very proud of myself
1439965 it was nice to take july off i havent done that since i was 8
1439966 my big thing always is reading putts and putting the right speed on them and i put them both together today
1439967 today i was just enjoying making some putts i just havent shot that low in a while
1439968 i think i put a lot of pressure on myself and i came out here in the practice rounds and i was like man this course is tough
1439969 obviously i am in a really comfortable spot knowing i dont really have to go low to get a spot
1439970 when gasoline hit 4 50 a gallon the phone started ringing off the hook
1439971 the primary goal of the community is to provide members with a sense of belonging acceptance and skills for living without self destructive behavior patterns
1439972 if one of us doesnt come back in here it has been a success
1439973 it wouldnt be advisable to do this with every inmate at once because it would be chaos
1439974 the hardest thing to do in life is change not knowing whats coming at you you push it away but my counselor asked me to give it a try its teaching me to recognize i can work out a situation without fighting
1439975 all offenders will benefit from an environment that instills self esteem pro social values and a generally safer environment
1439976 that gives a lot of meaning to what we do
1439977 it was pretty cramped down there the whole terminal was down there
1439978 given that the northern spotted owl has been experiencing about a 4 percent annual rate of population decline for the last 15 years any reductions from current levels of habitat protection cannot be justified
1439979 they are sort of rushing to this assumption of if it hasnt been identified as an owl conservation area it isnt going to be providing any habitat area to the owls and that simply is not true
1439980 we feel like we have a pretty solid broad network of habitat to work with for the recovery of the owl
1439981 we have made some concessions including agreeing to postpone the elections and we have shown flexibility on this
