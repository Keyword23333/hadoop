1760221 friends are gods way of apologizing to us for our families
1760222 a real friend is one who walks in when the rest of the world walks out
1760223 we all take different paths in life but no matter where we go we take a little of each other everywhere
1760224 life is partly what we make it and partly what is made by the friends whom we choose
1760225 a friend is someone who is there for you when hed rather be somewhere else
1760226 friends are the chocolate chips in the cookie of life
1760227 i get by with a little help from my friends

1760231 let me make a point about efficiency because my republican opponents they dont like to talk about efficiency
1760232 you know the other day i was in a town hall meeting and i laid out my plans for investing 15 billion a year in energy efficient cars and a new electricity grid and somebody said well what can i do what can individuals do
1760233 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do i dont understand it theyre going around theyre sending like little tire gauges making fun of this idea as if this is barack obamas energy plan
1760234 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent
1760235 you know they think it is funny that they are making fun of something that is actually true they need to do their homework because this is serious business instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1760236 obama said a couple of days ago says we all should inflate our tires i dont disagree with that the american automobile association strongly recommends it
1760237 what we as individuals can do right now to help with the energy crisis

1760242 we more than doubled our anticipated beta audience for wizard101
1760243 it turns out that the solid game mechanics and whimsical fantasy environment appeal even beyond the tween audience weve had a great response from testers that included everyone from grandmas who play with a grandchild sitting in their lap to twenty something traditional gamers
1760244 wizard101 is a great game for the whole family especially for kids i watch my 6 year old and my 14 year old laughing with each other instead of irritating one another as brothers tend to do i play right along side of my kids
1760245 having been a gamer for 30 years now playing with my kids has to be the most fun i have ever had they enjoy the ability to get many different spells and see all the amazing animations and both are always wanting to start new wizards to try the others i think the variety of schools and the spells that goes with them makes wizard101 stand out over other online games

1760264 activision wont publish soviet assault the upcoming world in conflict console game no
1760265 thats part of the whole situation now in theory they could sell world in conflict separately from massive i think that any buyer would like to make sure it goes together but we dont own it activision owns it so thats their call
1760266 apparently they didnt want an rts studio in europe and to be honest we would have loved to have worked with activision but were pretty confident in our capabilities and there are not many studios that can match our quality

1760278 im not happy with him not running out the last ground ball last night maddon said before wednesdays game
1760279 i didnt take him out of the game everybody was hurt last night so i had to wait until today to do it
1760280 i really dont believe in a whole lot of rules and regulations maddon said
1760281 personally i dont believe in it i like to believe that you are a man and can pretty much police yourself
1760282 will i be ready i think i will be ready
1760283 im reasonably confident that i can get my game in shape come thursday it is a tough golf course which suits me but im pretty comfortable with the test ahead
1760284 best player in the world to have never won a major
1760285 i remember obviously beating phil mickelson on sunday 3 2 in singles that was nice the whole week itself was unforgettable
1760286 it was nice to go on the practice ground today you could kind of picture the way the stands were where all the signs were all of that
1760287 theres probably 20 or 30 guys here who are very very capable of winning it maybe even more
1760288 weve seen in the past a lot of guys come from out of the field where you are in the world rankings doesnt necessarily mean anything nowadays guys are so good
1760289 you look at my record when i get on a roll i tend to stay on that roll for a good while
1760290 and when i win i win a few tournaments in a block

1760293 i dont see why he wouldnt come back next year
1760294 to go to the race everything wouldve had to be absolutely perfect
1760295 now we will point for the del mar derby or the kent breeders cup
1760296 im very very pleased with this whole cycle of training up to his race
1760297 his work saturday was well within himself and he finished in a stunning way he went his last three eighths in under 35 seconds
1760298 i dont think i can hold that last race against her honestly
1760299 it ended up being a race where she was a little too fresh off a five week layoff and she goes pretty quickly never really got a chance to settle im not sure she ever got a chance to run her race
1760300 with all those really nice fillies in there i realize this is an extremely competitive spot
1760301 but the way shes doing in the morning im not down on her at all thats for sure

1760324 it was a pretty solid finish to be in top 10 in the world at the olympics but i dont feel like it was my best race ever
1760325 i had been working really hard all season just to qualify and the criteria was set up for qualification that made it really difficult to be on form for the actual event itself
1760326 im really hopeful for good legs and also good luck
1760327 i went there with this awe and respect for the games
1760328 i was honored just to be there representing i was really just incredibly proud and amazed to be there
1760329 im stronger than ive ever been im smarter than ive ever been in the racing world and i know how to play the game so i want to go there and do my best and see if i cant pull off an amazing finish
1760330 its an opportunity and i think ive learned over the years that if were really focused on what were doing and we believe what we can accomplish we can do it im ready to go there with an open heart and open mind to all the potential that can lie ahead

1760354 there have been highly suspicious actions and claims associated with his asserted absence of assets
1760355 the undocumented claim that all chattels in the home belong entirely to mrs petricevic is not particularly plausible in a context where activity of this sort has occurred the courts must be astute to protect creditors against what could well be gaming behaviour
1760356 all we know is that hes had significant income in the last four years yet he says hes got no assets i cant reconcile that
1760357 we dont think she has the means to give the child insulin
1760358 we believe shes still in the area she didnt have much money and the van didnt have much gas

1760362 lenders in new zealand are largely unregulated and many make their business out of preying on the most vulnerable in our society
1760363 these parts of the sector are more vulnerable to declining asset prices falling real incomes climbing interest rates and if the economic downturn continues increasing rates of unemployment
1760364 some of the growth in household debt also reflects banks aggressive marketing of credit facilities and a culture of debt
1760365 accumulating evidence suggests that many non bank lenders and banks have been indulging in lending practices of a questionable ethical nature
1760366 while the average person in contemporary culture may see a break or rupture between expensive high end mobile phone and storybook a child will reach out towards a readily accessible toy and begin to simply to read to allow its story teller to begin karpinska has put the story teller into the device
1760367 private sector employers are finding it pretty difficult to compete
1760368 he calls public servants fat cats because a surgeon working at a hospital earns more than a teenager working at mcdonalds
1760369 so the fact that public sector workers actually get paid 20 percent more is evidence of how out of line wage setting has been in the public sector
1760370 private sector companies in wellington are facing wage pressure and employee retention issues because of public sector competition these are not low payers they are serious corporates
1760371 quando os efeitos das exporta es do terceiro mundo sobre os sal rios nos eua se tornaram uma quest o alguns economistas eu inclusive olharam os dados e conclu ram que os efeitos sobre os sal rios nos eua eram modestos

1760376 breaking our oil addiction is one of the greatest challenges our generation will ever face

1760379 we know the vast majority of those on the site are responsible and law abiding and we want to be able to provide a service to them

1760385 it would appear the woman had spoken to the men about smoking earlier this week
1760386 on wednesday morning when she was at the station she was walking past the same men when one of them pushed her and she fell onto the track she suffered a fractured wrist and bruising to her legs she was taken to hospital for treatment but has since been released
1760387 the woman was very lucky she was not more seriously injured the third rail carries 750 volts of electricity and she could have been electrocuted or even struck by an early morning train

1760392 when broadridge reported voting results for withholds a truncation error occurred in reporting share numbers that exceeded eight digits
1760393 theres clearly something that someone knows that theyre not saying
1760394 its yet another black eye for yahoo and who knows if its an error from the tabulation firm
1760395 there will be continued pressure on yang and the board for losing the microsoft deal
1760396 while it is a terrible crime that these youths have committed i dont see why people need to interfere in other peoples lives if people want to smoke they know the risks on their health and that they could get fined if there is a no smoking sign and if they want to risk the penalty let them
1760397 dog eat dog smokers have been walked all over so why shouldnt they do it to others contempt breeds contempt sensible germans are showing us the way
1760398 im assuming that if she was pregnant she was simply asking them not to smoke near her for the sake of her unborn child
1760399 until thugs like this know what it is to experience fear and feel pain nothing will change
1760400 why ban smoking on an open air platform in the first place and why try and enforce a silly law in the first place especially when its not your job and your pregnant and have the safety of your child to worry about
1760401 this is a turn about usually smokers are in real physical danger from rabid hate mongering who are often verbally abusing them people have learned to hate smokers to the point of walking across an open field outdoors to say their smoking is bothering them
1760402 not only should these youths be punished if caught but also the parents for raising them to have no respect to other people or the law
1760403 not so long ago the following was published police chief has urged the public to be have a go heroes northumbria polices chief constable mike craik said ordinary people should challenge rowdy behaviour such as drinking or swearing to improve society so now we see what happens
1760404 things we still use because thats the way weve always done this
1760405 findability has been a common source of frustration in the enterprise for decades
1760406 as information has become more and more digital from its creation through to management the pain of finding enterprise information has moved from the piles of paper on the desktop and in storage cabinets to the digital landfill of file servers e mail inboxes digital desktops and content management systems despite the advances made in search on the internet enterprise search leaves most users frustrated
1760407 criticality of findability to their organizations business goals and success
1760408 48 of all data is entirely fabricated but 98 of the time we cant prove it because no one knows where any of the information is
1760409 to what purpose are powers limited and to what purpose is that limitation committed to writing if these limits may at any time be passed by those intended to be restrained
1760410 you can argue that nobody is ready to be president
1760411 you can argue that even if youve been vice president for eight years that no one can be fully ready for the pressures of the office
1760412 was e mailing me late at night with gobbledygook ranting and raving
1760413 that both of us avoid relapsing into our previous substance abuse
1760414 my concern was that there was not significant enough of a fine
1760415 when you start doing negotiations that go to a high level of detail usually they get worked out
1760416 transactions are not rejected because they couldnt figure out whether the ball should be on the 46 yard line rather than the 48 yard line
1760417 in every case homosexual practice is considered sinful something that breaks our relationship with god and harms our wellbeing it is something for which one should repent and seek forgiveness and healing which god is ever ready to do not only is scripture to be taken seriously but it is to be obeyed because god intends for us things far better than we could ask or imagine
1760418 prossy had been forced into an engagement when her family discovered her relationship with the girlfriend she met at university both women were marched two miles naked to the police station where they were locked up
1760419 simply saying that the christian faith that we practice which was brought from the west by the way taught us what biblically sexuality is weve embraced that faith we are practicing that faith and moving away from that faith would be a contradiction to what we have inherited first of all our communities will not accept them because they will want to let them know that if that is your orientation you can come back to life
1760420 i was a stranger and you did not take me in naked and you did not clothe me sick and in prison and you did not visit me
1760421 how can we go to holy communion sit in bible study groups and share meals together pretending that everything is ok that we are still in fellowship with the persistent violators of biblical teaching and of lambeth resolutions
1760422 prossy was violently raped by police officers who taunted her with derogatory comments like well show you what youre missing and youre only this way because you havent met a real man she was also scalded on her thighs with hot meat skewers
1760423 its a possibility there we believe there is a possibility culturally secondly we believe there is a possibility according to christian faith and we believe that that god can bring you back when you have gone out of what is supposed to be intended by god now there is a complement in believing there is transformation there is restoration that makes us stand on the word of god which can bring change to people as it has done to us over a period of time
1760424 for i was hungry and you gave me food i was thirsty and you gave me drink i was a stranger and you took me in i was naked and you clothed me i was sick and you visited me i was in prison and you came to me
1760425 the church of uganda takes its anglican identity and the future hope of the global anglican communion very seriously
1760426 prossy was eventually taken out of prison after her father bribed the guards her family had decided they would sacrifice her instead believing this would take the curse away from the family whilst her family were making arrangements to slaughter her prossy managed to flee to the united kingdom to seek asylum
1760427 i would not believe a thing like that is done in the public knowledge of the people of uganda because the gay people who are ugandans are citizens of the country and we would cherish the fact that we would want to send it our people for some of those things probably you get information in england and we may not even get information i dont know how they get their information
1760428 judge not and you shall not be judged condemn not and you shall not be condemned forgive and you will be forgiven give and it will be given to you good measure pressed down shaken together and running over will be put into your bosom for with the same measure that you use it will be measured back to you
1760429 it will accuse the archbishop of canterbury of a betrayal at the very deepest level nor is the absence of uganda nigeria and other global south churches a sign that they want to leave the communion far from it it is a sign of how much they care that it endures read it all it is strong stuff
1760430 in view of the teaching of scripture upholds faithfulness in marriage between a man and a woman in lifelong union and believes that abstinence is right for those who are not called to marriage
1760431 we commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual persons and we wish to assure them that they are loved by god and that all baptised believing and faithful persons regardless of sexual orientation are full members of the body of christ
1760432 cannot advise the legitimising or blessing of same sex unions nor ordaining those involved in same gender unions
1760433 while rejecting homosexual practice as incompatible with scripture calls on all our people to minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals
1760434 when you saw me marched naked through the streets imprisoned tortured raped why did you did not look after me
1760435 i tell you the truth whatever you did not do for one of the least of these you did not do for me
1760436 tore the very fabric of our communion at its deepest level
1760437 minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation
1760438 all our people should minister pastorally and sensitively to all irrespective of sexual orientation and to condemn irrational fear of homosexuals
1760439 we commit ourselves to listen to the experience of homosexual persons and we wish to assure them that they are loved by god and that all baptised believing and faithful persons regardless of sexual orientation are full members of the body of christ
1760440 if god as they say is homophobic i wouldnt worship that god
1760441 what we seek to do in our context is faithfully to pass on what you passed on to us holy scripture apostolic ministry sacramental discipline but what are we to think when all these things seem to be questioned and even overturned we want to be pastorally caring to all to be inclusive as you like to say we want to welcome everyone yet the gospel and the faith you passed on to us tell us that some kinds of behaviour and relationship are not blessed by god our love and our welcome are unreal if we dont truthfully let others know what has shaped and directed our lives so along with welcome we must still challenge people to change their ways we dont see why welcoming the gay or lesbian person with love must mean blessing what they do in the churchs name or accepting them for ordination whatever their lifestyle we seek to love them and all right we dont always make a good job of it but we cant just say that there is nothing to challenge isnt it like the dilemma of the early church welcoming soldiers yet seeking to get them to lay down their arms
1760442 but please remember also that while you may say that what you do neednt affect us your decisions make a vast difference to us
1760443 dont misunderstand us were not looking for safety and comfort some of us know quite a lot about carrying the cross but when that cross is laid on us by fellow christians its quite a lot harder to bear dont be too surprised if some of us want to be at a distance from you or if we want to support minorities in your midst who seem to us to be suffering

1760450 at this place however it should be remembered that we have only been pretending throughout that the fetus is a human being from the moment of conception a very early abortion is surely not the killing of a person and so is not dealt with by anything i have said here
1760451 motherhood entails 18 years of caring for another human being a major emotional financial and life changing decision
1760452 motherhood entails 18 years of caring for another human being a major emotional financial and life changing decision

1760457 i think the black people would say he obama dont talk act or carry himself as a black person
1760458 but i think that thats what they would say even though the black society would pull for him i still think that they think in the back of their mind that the only reason he is in the general election is because he talks acts and carries himself as a caucasian

1760462 christianity and islam are the largest and second largest religions in the world and in history christians and muslims reportedly make up over a third and over a fifth of humanity respectively together they make up more than 55 of the worlds population making the relationship between these two religious communities the most important factor in contributing to meaningful peace around the world as the leader of over a billion catholics and moral example for many others around the globe yours is arguably the single most influential voice in continuing to move this relationship forward in the direction of mutual understanding we share your desire for frank and sincere dialogue and recognize its importance in an increasingly interconnected world upon this sincere and frank dialogue we hope to continue to build peaceful and friendly relationships based upon mutual respect justice and what is common in essence in our shared abrahamic tradition particularly the two greatest commandments in mark 12 29 31 and in varying form in matthew 22 37 40
1760463 as muslims we say to christians that we are not against them and that islam is not against them so long as they do not wage war against muslims on account of their religion oppress them and drive them out of their homes
1760464 is christianity necessarily against muslims in the gospel jesus christ says
1760465 finally as muslims and in obedience to the holy quran we ask christians to come together with us on the common essentials of our two religions let this common ground be the basis of all future interfaith dialogue between us for our common ground is that on which hangs all the law and the prophets matthew 22 40
1760466 there can be no peace among the nations without peace among the religions there can be no peace among the religions without dialogue
1760467 jesus answered pilate my kingdom is not of this world

1760476 we knew that netroots nation was holding its conference in austin this weekend so we looked at it more as an opportunity to meet them head on
1760477 they thought i was the new hire you know the new manager coming in
1760478 i think its really of kind of funny its like they have to justify their existence by comparing themselves to us
1760479 the point of rightonline is to get the conservatives focused and engaged and all sitting in the same room together
1760480 up until now we didnt really have an answer to something like netroots nation we were all doing our own thing not really working together
1760481 i love it because any citizen can go there and enter their address and see whats going on around them
1760482 it really simplifies our desire to get that information out to the community in a packet that is easy to use
1760483 the big thing that i see is that it does enable us as a state to coordinate activities and analyze crime patterns and trends on a regional basis
1760484 of course the ultimate goal is seamless coordination and consistent information sharing to improve public safety
1760485 we think its a wonderful tool for the community to have to get a visual idea of whats going on in their community
1760486 thats one thing that i have heard many people say that they work better in a group kind of situation
1760487 youll find that many of the government workers will go to lunch together

1760498 i have been skeptical that lawsuits are a good way of ensuring protection for all consumers
1760499 while im respectful of state regulators i have been skeptical that lawsuits are a good way of ensuring protection for all consumers

1760510 continuing a dod push to award fees more carefully and on a more objective basis
1760511 dod is always looking for the latest technology for its satellites
1760512 the problem is that technology develops quickly but the development of the satellite itself takes a while by the time it gets to its maturity you realize theres more advanced technology out there so you add that at the last minute and it leads to higher costs

1760581 we really wanted to look at making penfields roads safer for bicyclists and make penfield more of a biking kind of town
1760582 what we had to do was establish a starting point
1760583 what we did with the steering committee was to identify priority destinations and roads to reach them and examined needs for improvements on those roads
1760584 those were the routes that the bicycle committee selected as logical linkages between the destinations that were identified
1760585 they become the first round of roads in penfield to receive improvements in terms of bicycle traffic
1760586 the primary topic that everyone wants to discuss when we talk about bicycling is safety
1760587 everyone wants to have a sense of comfort that the road is being shared
1760588 theres a few places like that in town where conditions change

1761097 it takes me a month to get an appointment for my own doctor and im a physician for gods sake
1761098 half of people had waiting times of 31 minutes or less
1761099 the er has become the front door to the hospital
1761100 millions more people each year are seeking emergency care but emergency departments are continuing to close often because so much care goes uncompensated
1761101 this report is very troubling because it shows that care is being delayed for everyone including people in pain and with heart attacks
1761102 i went in the subway sandwich shop and ordered two sandwiches and i paid almost 12 for the sandwich i did not get the sandwich made the way to be made the way i wanted to
1761103 he actually called 911 to tell us that he needed our assistance because his sandwich was improperly made
1761104 they locked the door on me they got the sandwiches i paid for inside the store im not leaving here until i got what i paid for im not going to sit and pay 12 or 10 for some sandwiches and not get what i paid for
1761105 then he calls a third time and wanted to know where police were once we arrived he was totally irrational
1761106 he was obviously having a bad day and he was going to take it out on anybody he could and he verbally took it out on the restaurant and he took it out on us when we went to assist him
1761107 provide my foe and friend a bloodless day invite boys and girls for peace to pray
1761108 music crosses borders and its an exceptional tool for good will among people
1761109 exelons corporate values include a strong commitment to keeping our neighbors informed we hope that people in victoria county and in all of texas turn to our new web site when they need information about our plans
1761110 there were some people in the courtroom that were taken aback by it
1761111 those were the only words i heard him utter in the courtroom
1761112 he shook his head in response to questions from the judge some shakes of his appeared to be in the affirmative some of them appeared to be in the negative
1761113 while greener vehicles are the future lsvs should be used in controlled low speed environments like campuses and retirement communities where the risk of entering into a collision with a faster motor vehicle would be lower than on public roads
1761114 low speed vehicles under the regulation are not designed not meant for mainstream road use
1761115 we can be a positive impact for the whole country
1761116 its amazing you dont have to work at all you just walk to the mailbox and there it is
1761117 the continual amount of oil in north dakota is three times as much as texas
1761118 were doing as much as we can to try and get it out
1761119 im fairly certain that if they drilled a well here theyd have oil
1761120 they just need to perfect how to get it out
1761121 i think we can be a positive impact for the whole country if we can figure this out
1761122 we have a real housing shortage at this time but eventually itll be ok
1761123 its a good challenge its better than going the other way
1761124 my biggest concern today is making sure our infrastructure is adequate for the growth that wed like to maintain
1761125 id have said you were crazy it wouldnt come to pass
1761126 its just kind of difficult to change a pattern of living
1761127 were old enough now so we dont have great desires for bigger and better
1761128 its kind of sad for them because they went through life and never got it and now its coming
1761129 i cant get tired of that i just grin all the way to it and back
1761130 emily and i are frustrated sometimes with any kind of box
1761131 because we want to experiment musically and we do a lot of electric stuff but the reality is that we are a folk band
1761132 at some point i was hanging around with the butchies a band i ended up playing with a lot and it just brought out this thing in me and it felt very different from the indigo girls
1761133 something like bus bus i wanted this lead thing going on with a kind of raucous band and the harmonies are very important but they are more of a bed that youre singing over rather than the duo
1761134 i think the musicians i play with solo do a certain thing that the musicians we play with with the indigo girls dont do its just a different thing and it sort of steers my writing in some ways
1761135 radio radio slc fighting the good fight for me boys and girls lend a hand bend an ear in gods land
1761136 i was thinking about community radio in general and i was thinking about mormonism and the fabric of the country and how much you see when youre traveling and the idea that change comes but it comes slow and it comes one person at a time
1761137 for indie labels it was a big adjustment because we ended up with a lot of cds on hand when downloading happened we knew it was coming it came but it happened a little bit faster than we thought
1761138 there were business decisions that were hard but i love the freedom that downloading has brought and i love the way it saves resources
1761139 the internet has revolutionized the diy movement and its great to me i dont even know if record labels need to exist i dont even know if i need to exist
1761140 its like youre doing all this stuff the traveling and the unpacking and the packing just to play the show and in that one moment during the show thats the fun thats where all the fun is
1761141 you get to see different places get to go running in a different town every day its very stimulating and that can be a very good thing
1761142 the cost of living is crazy right now with two kids gas prices and rent im living paycheck to paycheck
1761143 we are seeing an increase in inquiries but were not sure if its due to the economy or increased awareness
1761144 i know thats why they call us for that financial remuneration she said
1761145 they dont like to openly admit that but some people are saying that
1761146 i think there is a spike more for financial reasons
1761147 its important to understand that if a young woman walks into a clinic and says she wants to be an egg donor the clinic doesnt just sit down and say sure and hand them money
1761148 there are national guidelines its a tightly orchestrated stringent process
1761149 its six to eight weeks of poking and probing and blood work
1761150 in an ideal world it would be nice to not have to give financial compensation
1761151 but i work for a living trying to help people and i get paid for it is that ok yeah i think thats ok
1761152 the best thing ive ever been in my life is a mom and to help someone else is a cool opportunity
1761153 knowing that it works is much better than the money
1761154 i have two children of my own and i definitely wanted other families to be able to have that opportunity
1761155 for my family the money wasnt a necessity but it was a nice nest egg if things should get worse my husband is in construction and thats not doing so well right now
1761156 im just making it up as i go along to be honest
1761157 run 8 1 2 days that would be a six out of 10 on the grunge scale that would serve home made cakes and fish finger sandwiches whose tickets would be 3 2
1761158 it is the place that i first saw any international cinema anything outside of mary poppins or whatever i was being taken to by my parents
1761159 i have sort of rumbled in and out for many years in different guises with different films short films experimental non narrative films hungarian films and so when they asked me to be some kind of mascot for it i mean i really couldnt be happier
1761160 i think it is a really beautiful piece of work and i am very very proud to be associated with it and for it to be acknowledged it will give the hollywood studios the courage to make more films like this
1761161 i wish you got a cash prize thats all i can say
1761162 im at some point going to have to sit somebody down and ask them really what it means
1761163 the chronicles of narnia the lion the witch and the wardrobe
1761164 im just making it up as i go along to be honest
1761165 the last thing i lined up for was et when it came out
1761166 if it pulls them in and theyre tweaked by it and it gets them interested then its good for stratford its good for the rsc and its good for shakespeare
1761167 only royal shakespeare company or production related memorabilia will be signed
1761168 your job is to try and see it as a play just another play to take each scene as it comes and play it as truthfully and as energetically as you can
1761169 we who seek the abolition of nuclear weapons are the majority
1761170 last year 170 countries voted in favour of japans un resolution calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons only three countries the united states among them opposed this resolution
1761171 we need to pass that message on to our childrens generation
1761172 overall were a very strong physical team thats kind of our style
1761173 them being small they probably got the worst of it
1761174 the goal was big for us its always frustrating when your pressuring the ball and it doesnt go into the net
1761175 we tried to play to our advantage which is use our skill and try to control the ball on the ground
1761176 a lot of people always think it rap started in the south bronx but officially it came from the west bronx cause kool herc credited with being the first rapper was from that area then it came over to the south bronx with myself and grandmaster flash
1761177 i like good music no matter what area or genre it comes from

1761183 have received help even if in many cases they still need a good deal more
1761184 thank god weve got a change coming things are even worse than i thought
1761185 the students psyche has seen large qualitative changes especially over the last decade the present day student is driven by career ambitions right from the time of admission itself many of them are probably working harder than what their counterparts did 20 years ago
1761186 you see how much rejection you can take and how you handle it with this type of job
1761187 its a skill for life because people arent going to say yes all the time you need to try and come back with something different to try and get a yes
1761188 then of course there is the financial reality of having to pay all of the business and employer taxes
1761189 of course were all about the irs getting the money thats due to it but we dont think its fair to increase the regulatory burdens on small businesses in order to do it
1761190 it has been pivotal in demonstrating to the student body that you can start high tech companies at yale a space where yale usually isnt known
1761191 theres a little bit of a competition whether their school is associated with the creative economy
1761192 yale no longer sees itself sending graduates out into the workforce as one kind of worker doing i banking or consulting

1761197 you tend to know more about yourself about what you like what you dont like
1761198 i have been very fortunate to have the opportunity to play basketball as a student athlete at ut martin and spend 35 years as a coach at ut knoxville
1761199 i appreciate every opportunity both schools have given me and hope this gift will afford other young women the same opportunities
1761200 pat is an amazing asset for the university of tennessee
1761201 far beyond her obvious achievements as a coach she is a role model a leader a champion for academics and graduation and i cannot imagine a single individual who has done more to contribute to the success and the respect of womens athletics in this country
1761202 we are excited to have this generous support from coach summitt her commitment will provide a major boost to our womens athletics program
1761203 so far as we know this is the single largest and most complex identity theft case ever charged in this country
1761204 it highlights the efforts of the justice department to fight this pernicious crime and shows that with the cooperation of our law enforcement partners around the world we can identify charge and apprehend even the most sophisticated international computer hackers
1761205 while technology has made our lives much easier it has also created new vulnerabilities this case clearly shows how strokes on a keyboard with a criminal purpose can have costly results consumers companies and governments from around the world must further develop ways to protect our sensitive personal and business information and detect those whether here or abroad that conspire to exploit technology for criminal gain
1761206 the u s military may be 30 percent robotic by the year 2020 according to doug few and bill smart of washington university in st louis
1761207 we are thrilled prince william and prince harry have agreed to attend the world premiere of our latest james bond film and are pleased this event will help raise much needed funds to support the servicemen of our country through the princes chosen charities help for heroes and the royal british legion
1761208 at a time when presidential campaign ads monopolize prime time we believe it is important to be able to provide traditional advertisers with a clutter free environment to showcase their brands and target marketing messages to a captive audience
1761209 i trusted and gave you 10 extra chances and still havent asked what happened with all the early yrs money when we were over 100k per month
1761210 i went way above what i should to help you and you havent even repaid one thing let alone all the mess and crimes i am cleaning up from you
1761211 u ungrateful stupid idiot you can rot in hell you arent even close to professional

1761218 i am disappointed that football did not get its credit we were having high hopes that at least one of us will get the award we won the nehru cup tournament an international title after a long time but football has not been given credit i dont know why they the committee do not want to give the award to a footballer
1761219 i feel we deserve recognition for our hard work at least one footballer should have been given the award but i dont know what was the reason for ignoring us we cant do anything if they do not want to give the award to us
1761220 if the government does not want to give us the award i have no disappointment but i feel we deserve to win it
1761221 i would have been happy had one of us got the award but then we cant do anything
1761222 from the word go i have said the tests should be held in mid august as it will give us appropriate time to prepare our case and travel to switzerland
1761223 the swiss embassy conducted asifs interview on monday and have agreed to issue the visa so that is a big burden off us as we want to be present for the b sample tests that is our right
1761224 it seems the pcb has distanced itself from asif in this case according to the boards rules and regulations we are not subject to request the board for any help
1761225 it is pcbs responsibility or rather choice that if they want to support us and send an official with us to switzerland or not
1761226 if they want to support him it is their discretion and then they should send their official
1761227 in spite of a slow start we began to collaborate still with no plans to make a whole record or whatever a collection of songs might be called now

1761229 we are so excited to be working with university of phoenix on this tour
1761230 it truly represents what the myspace music platform is all about creating unique opportunities for artists fans and brands to connect around music
1761231 although her career path may be different from many of our students
1761232 kates commitment to her education is the same she is one of over 345 000 current students who know university of phoenix plays an important role in higher education today
1761233 yes i cant help it that im indisposed right now
1761234 i meant you havent blogged in five days but im going to write this down
1761235 complete role reversal you were the one thinking about sex and i was the one thinking about your blog
1761236 we are investigating a burglary at an address in west wickham in the early hours of tuesday
1761237 theres nothing about this technology that limits its application to counterfeit investigations
1761238 some people who arent doing anything wrong may have their privacy threatened
1761239 he said that nancy went for a run with carrie clarke sic and she would be back soon adam stated in a july 22 affidavit
1761240 i welcome todays guilty verdict in the first trial held under the military commissions act mca this process of bringing terrorists to justice has been too long delayed but im encouraged that it is finally moving forward i supported that legislation which was a good faith effort by congress to meet the supreme courts direction to establish a process to bring terrorist detainees to trial salim ahmed hamdan a trusted confidante of osama bin laden was provided a full hearing of the charges against him and was represented by counsel who vigorously defended him the jury found that the prosecution lawyers had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that hamdan had aided terrorists by supplying weapons to al qaeda and taliban forces in afghanistan this process demonstrated that military commissions can effectively bring very dangerous terrorists to justice the fact that the jury did not find hamdan guilty of all of the charges brought against him demonstrates that the jury weighed the evidence carefully unlike senator obama who voted against the mca and favors giving al qaeda terrorists direct access to u s civilian courts to contest their detention i recognize that we cannot treat dangerous terrorists captured on the battlefield as we would common criminals
1761241 we did have a chance to talk a little sports and a little family backstage but that was completely normal not political
1761242 the fact that he would come here campaign here take the time to listen to hoosiers i think that shows us a lot of respect and i think that will impress a lot of voters here in indiana
1761243 im the wrong one to talk about that i literally have no idea what their timing is and thats entirely up to them
1761244 i dont know how to comment on that im not an expert on body language
1761245 the power to proceed because its structures and procedures violate both the uniform code of military justice and the four geneva conventions signed in 1949
1761246 im a scientist and i have to issue a cautionary note
1761247 science doesnt really know if they stay on the skin
1761248 we dont know nearly enough about the adverse reactions to any of these materials environmental or biological
1761249 nobody has a good answer to where they go in your body and what happens when theyre there
1761250 sometimes we want nanomaterial to be toxic like when its used in chemotherapy
1761251 but we dont want toxic side effects in nanomaterials that are repelling stains
1761252 although downside risks to growth remain the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1761253 if there is a subtle shift in the feds risk assessment it is that while acknowledging the downside risks to growth it notes the upside risks to inflation are also of significant concern
1761254 this may have been a sufficient bone to the hawks to prevent others from joining fisher in dissenting
1761255 what this means is that were going to see some more relief at the pump were probably looking at another 10 cents of downside in retail gas prices
1761256 that has taken a lot of pressure off the market it looks like the thinking is that we dodged another bullet
1761257 any market that really doesnt respond to seemingly bullish news is often a tip off that were going lower
1761258 they still have expensive gas to feed into the system so theyre reluctant to drop prices
1761259 prices never come down as fast as they go up
1761260 the market is increasing the odds now that the drilling deal will get done and we will see more production coming out of the gulf of mexico
1761261 hell just be a little tropical storm tike compared to big mammas that rip things up and spike gas prices
1761262 of course were all about the irs getting the money thats due to it but we dont think its fair to increase the regulatory burdens on small businesses in order to do it
1761263 we believe the two had some kind of altercation over shifting to the place where the other person lived kiran told her family that for sometime rahul wasnt calling her up and she wasn t aware of what was happening in his life at mumbai

1761330 given the significant uncertainty on the date for completion of our proceeding after issuance of the stbs time limits decision and the fact that u s steel has read the stock purchase agreement to require that this transaction close by dec 31 cn contacted u s steel last week to formally request an extension of the deadline
1761331 us steel is prepared to co operate with cn towards the goal of closing the transaction in 2008 but it will not agree to extend the deal therefore we need a decision in this case and we have decided to seek legal relief to allow cn to close on the transaction prior to dec 31

1761389 if science is the constellation of facts theories and methods collected in current texts then scientists are the men who successfully or not have striven to contribute one or another element to that particular constellation scientific development becomes the piecemeal process by which these items have been added singly and in combination to the ever growing stockpile that constitutes scientific technique and knowledge and history of science becomes the discipline that chronicles both these successive increments and the obstacles that have inhibited their accumulation
1761390 a conception of how science ought to develop that was a by product of the prevailing philosophy of science as well as a popular heroic view of scientific progress
1761391 i do not for a moment believe that science is an intrinsically irrational enterprise i take that assertion not as a matter of fact but rather of principle scientific behavior taken as a whole is the best example we have of rationality
1761392 history if viewed as a repository for more than anecdote or chronology could produce a decisive transformation in the image of science by which we are now possessed
1761393 it is i think particularly in periods of acknowledged crisis that scientists have turned to philosophical analysis as a device for unlocking the riddles of their field scientists have not generally needed or wanted to be philosophers
1761394 men whose research is based on shared paradigms are committed to the same rules and standards for scientific practice
1761395 no natural history can be interpreted in the absence of at least some implicit body of intertwined theoretical and methodological belief that permits selection evaluation and criticism
1761396 when an individual or group first produces a synthesis able to attract most of the next generations practitioners the older schools gradually disappear
1761397 the tradition shattering complements to the tradition bound activity of normal science
1761398 the successive transition from one paradigm to another via revolution is the usual developmental pattern of mature science
1761399 are simply read out of the profession and their work is subsequently ignored if they do not accommodate their work to the new paradigm they are doomed to isolation or must attach themselves to some other group
1761400 a new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grow up that is familiar with it
1761401 conversions occur not despite the fact that scientists are human but because they are
1761402 normal science does not aim at novelties of fact or theory and when successful finds none
1761403 under normal conditions the research scientist is not an innovator but a solver of puzzles and the puzzles upon which he concentrates are just those which he believes can be both stated and solved within the existing scientific tradition
1761404 paradigms gain their status because they are more successful than their competitors in solving a few problems that the group of practitioners has come to recognize as acute
1761405 by focusing attention on a small range of relatively esoteric problems the paradigm forces scientists to investigate some part of nature in a detail and depth that would otherwise be unimaginable
1761406 one of the things a scientific community acquires with a paradigm is a criterion for choosing problems that while the paradigm is taken for granted can be assumed to have solutions
1761407 the man who is striving to solve a problem defined by existing knowledge and technique is not just looking around he knows what he wants to achieve and he designs his instruments and directs his thoughts accordingly
1761408 novelty emerges only with difficulty manifested by resistance against a background provided by expectation
1761409 crisis alone is not enough there must also be a basis though it need be neither rational nor ultimately correct for faith in the particular candidate chosen
1761410 the normal scientific tradition that emerges from a scientific revolution is not only incompatible but often actually incommensurable with that which has gone before
1761411 noncumulative developmental episode in which an older paradigm is replaced in whole or in part by an incompatible new one
1761412 to the extent that two scientific schools disagree about what is a problem and what a solution they will inevitably talk through each other when debating the relative merits of their respective paradigms
1761413 more than any other single aspect of science that pedagogic form the textbook has determined our image of the nature of science and of the role of discovery and invention in its advance
1761414 a science that hesitates to forget its founders is lost

1761423 last week we showed a video of the mojave experiment to a small group of folks here on campus today we are excited to share the results with the public for those new to the mojave experiment its a focus group effort we initiated a few weeks ago we interviewed and polled 120 participants in san francisco in hopes of better understanding everyday users perceptions of windows vista and seeing whether there really is a gap between perception and reality we wanted to see how people reacted to windows vista when they were not aware they were seeing windows vista we recorded our discussions and today you can see them for yourself some other facts about the research the focus group took place over three days in san francisco and was conducted earlier this month all participants were either mac linux or users of versions of windows that came before windows vista respondents were chosen from the focus group organizers database called at random but then selected based on having a low perception of vista lt 5 rating on a scale of 1 10 the participants were given a demo by a trained retail salesperson geared towards the experiences they seemed most interested in following a series of interviews while the retail salesperson drove the demo it was geared by the interests and direction of the participant we did not use some geeked out or custom built pc we used an hp pavilion dv2500 it had 2gb of ram and was running an intel core 2 duo cpu t7500 2 20ghz the os was a 32 bit version of windows vista ultimate of the 120 respondents polled on a scale of 1 10 where 10 was the highest rating the average pre rating for windows vista was 4 4 after they saw the demo respondents rated mojave an average of 8 5 finally some people have asked if mojave is the big marketing project were working on its not that was me the mojave experiment is just that an experiment we conducted on the fly that yielded interesting results were publishing the video today because we think youll also find it interesting
1761424 we boarded up the windows and kind of left thinking it was going to be back in a couple of days and continue on with the process we were in in the middle of getting ready to open
1761425 for the forseeable future our entire business model there was just no place for it
1761426 they were looking for fun and they wanted to feel normal again

1761428 we went out and raised what we called a triage fund
1761429 i found that katrina really exposed the inner entrepreneur in everyone it delineated between small business owners and entrepreneurs
1761430 three years later from our perspective we think our entrepreneurial community is stronger
1761431 with the rising tide of boomer retirees employers will be losing key talent at a time when attracting and retaining skilled workers will be more important than ever
1761432 at the same time rising medical costs lengthening life spans and the declining prevalence of traditional pension and retiree medical benefits mean that employees will either have to work longer save more or live with significantly less than they are accustomed to
1761433 as these trends converge we believe phased retirement programs will continue to become more attractive options for both employers and employees they provide employers with new ways to retain critical talent and at the same time help employees meet their needs
1761434 working with senior management to determine how phased retirement programs will benefit both employers and employees is an important first step however in order to create a truly successful program its critical employers understand employees perspectives
1761435 gathering formal input from employees through focus groups or other initiatives will enable companies to design programs that can truly help with retention needs but do so in a cost efficient way
1761436 this is particularly important for employers concerned about workers in specific roles or with specialised skills that represent the greatest risk of loss to the organization
1761437 developing phased retirement programs specifically aligned to the needs and desires of the workforce are really effective at helping companies decrease the loss of key skills within their organization
1761438 perhaps one of the easiest and most cost effective ways to determine what will be most beneficial to near retirement employees is to simply ask them what type of arrangement would be most effective
1761439 is it the ability to work part time on a year round basis or is it some other type of flexible arrangement such as seasonal or project based assignments do they want to step away from demanding management roles what many companies will find is that their existing flexible work arrangements may be easily adaptable to their retirement eligible employees
1761440 there are multiple barriers women face that automatically put them at a disadvantage when it comes to meeting adequate retirement income levels some of which are preventable and some of which are not

1761471 maintaining iraq and u s funded investments which includes the maintenance of roads bridges vehicles buildings water and electricity installations and weapons
1761472 the iraqi government now has tens of billions of dollars at its disposal to fund large scale reconstruction projects
1761473 it is inexcusable for u s taxpayers to continue to foot the bill for projects the iraqis are fully capable of funding themselves we should not be paying for iraqi projects while iraqi oil revenues continue to pile up in the bank
1761474 the good and the bad of the human is be understood when you havent performed his desires

1761499 its a good group of veterans that are back for camp this year and we are looking to those players to push the pace here and lead and be at the front of things in terms of what we want in pace and tempo
1761500 i think all of those returning players were on last years team for a reason they have a lot of character work hard and are persistent in terms of the challenges we are going to have at camp
1761501 im sure they will have that mindset that they want to have a great team so im sure they will be pushing the pace

1761506 ser parte de una fusi n como sta es una situaci n extra a
1761507 durante los ltimos seis meses hemos estado esperando a la fusi n para superarla y entender si nos ven como parte de su futuro o no
1761508 parece que no quer an un estudio de estrategia en tiempo real en europa y para ser honestos nos hubiese encantado trabajar con activision pero confiamos mucho en nuestras capacidades y no hay muchos estudios que puedan igualar nuestra calidad
1761509 voters have trouble placing him in his context understanding the roots and values in which he is ineluctably embedded
1761510 but the generic ballot is so much better for the dem
1761511 they take such pride in their ignorance they must think were going to reward them for it
1761512 i told her with a little luck she could be the only woman ever to serve as first lady and miss buffalo chip
1761513 they have bird flu symptoms such as fever and breathing difficulties
1761514 we want to see prosperity and freedom restored to burma
1761515 the united states believes the people of china deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings
1761516 so america stands in firm opposition to chinas detention of political dissidents human rights advocates and religious activists
1761517 nargis has shown that if the u s wants to help the burmese people they need to have some kind of relationship with the burmese military government
1761518 the p5 1 are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider possible outlines of another sanctions resolution
1761519 this has in the past taken months and i am not going to guess how long this will take and where it may ultimately lead
1761520 we are very disappointed that iran has failed yet again to give javier solana a clear answer to the p5 1 generous incentives package the letter we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1761521 small businesses place great value on an apprenticeship and are prepared to invest in them but they are often impeded by lengthy administration and the costs of providing training many are not aware about wage contribution for time off to train
1761522 we would like to see greater efforts to make small businesses aware of financial support for providing training and a reduction in the bureaucracy to receive it this should enable employers to tell the next generation of apprentices youre hired
1761523 short answer yes with an if long answer no with a but
1761524 short answer yes with an if long gt answer no with a but
1761525 einiges davon ist recht finster mit fellatio durch tiere und lesbischen szenen
1761526 persistence prevails like a stream that is temporarily blocked by boulders and then collects force enough to overflow onward
1761527 although i do not yet know exactly what my comment will entail i can say with a great degree of certainty that it will be incredibly stupid
1761528 wonderment and joy are retained and the heart aches and nightmares are left out
1761529 the first leg of the decline in commodities is under our belt
1761530 inflation has been high spurred by the earlier increases in the prices of energy and some other commodities and some indicators of inflation expectations have been elevated
1761531 the committee expects inflation to moderate later this year and next year but the inflation outlook remains highly uncertain
1761532 the recent housing bailout bill is the most inflationary legislation ever enacted and there is already talk of yet another economic stimulus bill
1761533 the new money creation will not only reverse the recent declines in commodity prices but send other consumer prices soaring as well
1761534 barack obama has played the race card and he played it from the bottom of the deck its divisive negative shameful and wrong
1761535 nobody thinks that bush and mccain have a real answer to the challenges we face so what theyre going to try to do is make you scared of me
1761536 you know hes not patriotic enough hes got a funny name
1761537 what barack obama was talking about was that he didnt get here after spending decades in washington
1761538 its a leap electing a 46 year old black guy named barack obama
1761539 hes young and inexperienced and hes got a funny name and did i mention hes black
1761540 in juxtaposing barack obama with britney spears and paris hilton the mccain campaign is simply trying to plant the old racist seed of black man hitting on young white woman not directly but subliminally and disgracefully
1761541 shes a wonderful child a complete part of our family and we love her
1761542 we asked them not to run it im sending them an e mail as we speak asking them to take it down
1761543 i dont know why they do it and obviously i dont control them but im making it very clear as i have a couple of times in the past that theres no place for that kind of campaigning and the american people dont want it period
1761544 a long time ethnic double standard dominates american politics the media routinely magnify and decry the tiniest republican racial missteps while minimizing and dismissing overt democratic racism
1761545 mccain has not raised obamas race as an issue in the campaign though he has said that obama lacks experience
1761546 there is no race card here except for the one the mccain campaign is using
1761547 the most negative campaign i have seen in a long time
1761548 in 2008 people dont play the race card the way they did in 1968
1761549 almost surely attack irans nuclear sites in the next four to seven months
1761550 a ratcheting up of the iranian israeli conflict to a nuclear level will most likely follow
1761551 gas prices 4 5 no end in sight because some in washington are still saying no to drilling in america
1761552 who can you thank for rising prices at the pump
1761553 oil and gas executives have not traditionally been a major source of campaign money for mccain
1761554 i didnt think twice about using my cell when it was only annoying other people but now that it may be harming me im going to have to kiss it goodbye
1761555 i loved when it would go off in the middle of a movie and wreck the experience for everyone seated around me that was awesome

1761583 we hope not but the weather is always bad in beijing in the summer
1761584 the chinese seem to be pretty open to this thing
1761585 ill look at carl when i say this and he can slap me if he wants
1761586 he wasnt ready to win a championship i think until this year
1761587 i think this year he can go head to head with jimmie johnson tony stewart with anybody else thats there and i think he can close the deal
1761588 i dont necessarily agree 100 percent but i get the point
1761589 ill put it this way i feel like im better as a race car driver than ive ever been i dont know if i wasnt ready to win a championship or something like that but i can tell you that i feel like ive learned a lot
1761590 the championship ultimately winds up being determined by how well you do when things go bad
1761591 its when you have to say my cars not right weve had a little wreck you know somethings happened
1761592 do you go on and self destruct or do you manage to be in the frame of mind where you can go on and get the most out of it
1761593 right now they and carl and bob are in the same league with the best unless youve got that level of maturity and wisdom and presence and experience that gives you that within the organization having a lot of speed in the car being able to win a lot of races is not going to do it
1761594 when things go bad youre going to disintegrate carl is going to be able to overcome that this year im real confident
1761595 i have hopes still of getting david ragan in the chase which will be real exciting
1761596 of course matt and greg will make a good accounting of themselves too theyre in championship form the organizations look great
1761597 we will work to assure the brush gets picked up as much and as soon as possible
1761598 we will work with whoever gets the contract to ensure they pick up as much as possible and soon as possible even if we need to offer assistance with our crews
1761599 the poor guys are doing the best they can its not their fault
1761600 we want to finish as soon as possible we will communicate with the state to let them know we are picking up debris
1761601 i hope they release us tonight so we can go home
1761602 there must be some reason why they have brought us here
1761603 the taliban are trying to reassert control not only in terms of fighting and taking control of a town militarily but also trying to put into place other structures of government that will build legitimacy
1761604 they insist on the local people going there rather than to the police or the official courts
1761605 there have been no choppings of hands because there are no thieves
1761606 one of my friends is a judge and the taliban sent him letters telling him to stop working the second letter said well kill you if you work
1761607 also they issued a fatwa religious edict that anyone who works with the government will be killed
1761608 im a journalist and this is a new thing that is happening in ghazni
1761609 the taliban were doing this sort of thing when they were in power but never since they fell
1761610 now is not the time for this kind of talk its over now
1761611 we did wrong it was a mistake we wont do it again
1761612 the courts run by the government are active around the country
1761613 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible
1761614 this is something that we immediately asked to be done last week realizing that these could be offensive
1761615 i was like where the heck did he get that squeegee at i thought maybe he stopped at a gas station on the way to the track it was funny
1761616 if you worry about it youll perform worse most of the time
1761617 i went off track a couple of times but the car was fast and hopefully well have the same type of car this weekend
1761618 the last five races and ever since we won the pole in loudon its given us a little bit more confidence and now were running top 20 a little bit more
1761619 im starting to battle with the cup drivers a little bit more where i couldnt early on out there
1761620 you still have to be smooth but you can enter a corner as late as you want and just abuse the car i think you need a little bit more finesse with a stock car than you do with an indy car otherwise you will just burn everything up
1761621 you have to let the car do what it wants
1761622 thats the biggest thing ive learned im still learning every race that we go to every track that i race on im still learning a little bit more and more
1761623 things dont happen so fast as when youre in an indy car
1761624 even at an oval track like las vegas i was coming down the straightaway and i would snap sideways with the car but on a road course things happen a little bit more slowly
1761625 i like the ovals and thats what i want to do the irl is going away from ovals and for me i have no interest in going back
1761626 it will be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1761627 i agree with the american automobile association we should all inflate our tires
1761628 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1761629 thats a debate im happy to have because senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists and its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists
1761630 in five short months the bush administration will be done
1761631 ran an ad saying washington is broken no kidding it took him 26 years to figure it out
1761632 i agree with the american automobile association we should all inflate our tires
1761633 my opponent doesnt want to drill he doesnt want nuclear power he wants you to inflate your tires
1761634 if you are afraid it should be with obama who will destroy this great country he is the next liar
1761635 we still need to push very hard in the development of the car and the reliability but even in a worse case like this were still in the championship completely
1761636 were still in the fight well be pushing very hard over the break
1761637 we are very sad for felipe because he did in my view the best race of his career today
1761638 it was fantastic in the way he attacked and the way he managed the race so we are very disappointed for that
1761639 i think im still growing a lot and learning race to race and that can help for the championship the confidence and thats the most important thing
1761640 i think for the moment everything is completely open we have three cars in a very small gap in terms of points
1761641 hes very strong for sure this kind of race if youre able mentally to manage after the disappointment you have you will only get stronger
1761642 and this is what were going to do together because that is the way we are going to approach the next race in valencia
1761643 when the track is clear we showed that we have the speed when there is traffic we cant take advantage
1761644 it was a disappointing weekend for me but at least i managed to come away with a decent result
1761645 we had good speed in the race and without the mistake in qualifying it would be better
1761646 we cannot accept these kinds of problems we are paying too much of a price for this
1761647 qualifying is crucial and the difference today was that on one side massa we are able to jump in front and race like we were able to do and on the other hand raikkonen in the middle of the field it was nearly impossible to do something
1761648 theres no noise no checking the oil or how much gas youve got you just get on and go
1761649 a lot of people perceive golf carts as little more than toys but our findings suggest they can be quite dangerous especially when used on public roads
1761650 this maybe would save us about 600 to 700 a year in fuel just for the water department
1761651 we are not mouthpieces we are not gunslingers that do the bidding of someone whose rationale we do not share and whose view of the world
1761652 we feel that the request is beyond what we should be asked to do beyond what our professional ethics allow us to do
1761653 we do not share his theory of the case to the extent we can understand his theory of the case
1761654 im tired of everyone else harping on 4 a gallon for gas
1761655 weve been paying that for four years when everybody else was paying 2 a gallon
1761656 we are taking care of the challenges we have in alaska on our own
1761657 if we had to go to the store and buy everything wed probably be on food stamps by now if we didnt have our land and sea animals
1761658 more and more our take home pay is going to be spent to buying gas to go get caribou to go get fish to go to our camps and gather our food
1761659 normally i run into six or more boats on the water this time
1761660 where i went on the kobuk i was the only one there im still wondering how many of us will be able to go hunting moose and caribou this year
1761661 we could be going back to dog teams if we cant afford the cost of gas for subsistence hunting

1761683 you measure the size of the accomplishment by the obstacles you had to overcome to reach your goals

1761685 it is neither wealth nor splendor but tranquility and occupation which give happiness

1761708 obviously she was arrested in 2003 but we dont know at what stage she was handed over to the americans
1761709 it is a little ironic that while the government is trying to prove the military commissions process is legitimate in the hamdan trial that the next person they arrest immediately goes into the federal court system

1761719 it turns out that the solid game mechanics and whimsical fantasy environment appeal even beyond the tween audience weve had a great response from testers that included everyone from grandmas who play with a grandchild sitting in their lap to twenty something traditional gamers
1761720 wizard101 is a great game for the whole family especially for kids i watch my 6 year old and my 14 year old laughing with each other instead of irritating one another as brothers tend to do i play right along side of my kids

1761756 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1761757 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
1761758 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip

1761839 new influencers are beginning to tear at the fabric of traditional marketing and communications giving rise to a new approach characterized by conversation and community
1761840 pr and marketing communications professionals are responding with a mixture of excitement fear and fascination theyre alarmed at the prospect of ceding control of their messages to a community of unknowns yet at the same time theyre excited about this new opportunity to speak directly with their constituents
1761841 this study represents one of the first in depth investigations into changing patterns of influence and their impact on public relations and corporate communications
1761842 we wanted to learn what criteria communications professionals use to define new influencers how social media is being used to communicate with these influencers and how to measure the effects of such efforts the ultimate goal of the study is to offer a set of recommendations to the pr profession these are embodied within the excellent case studies collected by our research fellows

1761858 the goal of the operation is to seek out and destroy criminal elements and terrorist threats in diyala and eliminate smuggling corridors in the surrounding area
1761859 it will continue until we destroy al qaeda the militias and the outlaws in the province
1761860 we hope this operation will be 100 percent successful we hope it will be the death blow for al qaeda and the militias that want to destroy the province
1761861 we have seen a number of occurrences lately where a large number of civilians have been killed it would be fair to say that this year so far there has been an increase in the number of civilians killed by all sides
1761862 in large afghan weddings women typically wear big green chadors or big red chadors their clothes are shiny for the celebration
1761863 iraq and afghanistan remain the central fronts in the struggle but we cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multi dimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
1761864 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
1761865 the use of force plays a role yet military efforts to capture or kill terrorists are likely to be subordinate to measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
1761866 for these reasons arguably the most important military component of the struggle against violent extremists is not the fighting we do ourselves but how well we help prepare our partners to defend and govern themselves
1761867 i think irregular warfare is very important particularly in contrast to preparing solely for conventional warfighting but it shouldnt be our only focus
1761868 we ought to be training our forces and procuring our weapons systems to reflect the reality

1761873 using simple mechanics principles the researchers have produced for the first time electronic devices on a hemispherical surface so that they can take images much like those captured by the human eye
1761874 this strategy opens up exciting new engineering design possibilities by eliminating the two dimensional planar constraints of conventional semiconductor wafer based optoelectronics
1761875 mechanics helps to reduce the stresses and strain in components and guide and optimize the system design
1761876 we believe that some of the most compelling areas of future application involve the intimate conformal integration of electronics with the human body in ways that are inconceivable using established technologies
1761877 we are working actively with collaborators to explore possibilities in advanced health monitors prosthetic devices and therapeutic systems

1761882 this trial project is of great significance for the entire country
1761883 i wasnt expecting all of this everyone has been so nice and helpful
1761884 to issues of my personal life i discuss those with family personal triumphs personal defeats highs and lows are matters for anna i and the family to celebrate or discuss i therefore do not consider my personal life a subject to be aired in public and used for political gamesmanship
1761885 to the issue of professional integrity as president of the port authority i will stand on my record i do not believe that there is evidence to support any accusation of my exerting undue influence to any matter involving the port authority
1761886 i have been a public administrator for nearly 40 years and i know how to separate my personal life from my professional life
1761887 to the specific issue of the northwest ohio legislative consortium i am among its founders and am proud of the concept and proud of the accomplishments that are attributed to it
1761888 the cost benefit ratio of consortium partner investment to federal dollars generated is quite positive through the consortiums work toledo has received millions of dollars in federal appropriations and grants
1761889 the consortiums work has been important to this community and has been praised regularly by our federal elected leaders
1761890 yes i among others lobbied aggressively to create the consortium and would do so now
1761891 kathy teigland did an outstanding job as the representative of wise and associates when the consortium was first created and continued to successfully represent the consortium following the wise contract
1761892 some time off is putting it mildly i took about 16 years off
1761893 i love my mom and dad so when they got sick i didnt really want to record too much i had to go spend more time in detroit
1761894 i always have an instrumental on every album and some of those radio stations just pick up on that one instrumental
1761895 even in my earlier days there was a big hit being played called after midnight that we play in the show i guess thats when they first started smooth jazz radio and they picked it up it was a b side
1761896 i hadnt made a record in such a long time i didnt have a major label record deal i just felt i was free to record whatever i want i feel free right now
1761897 ive been playing with these guys since i was 18 years old ive known joe sample pianist and wilton felder saxophonist for a long time we just tour sometimes then theres a couple years when we dont do anything
1761898 that was a lot of fun wish i could go back there working with marvin gaye was absolutely wonderful smokey robinson and of course stevie wonder who taught me how to write songs those were the days i remember probably some of the happiest days of my life
1761899 i did all the barry white records in the earlier days and i wrote some of the songs i just liked working for barry he was very exact and he would do things very fast
1761900 im playing on cant get enough of your love youre the first the last my everything love theme and all the big hits he had
1761901 its one of those songs that gosh just seems to be part of american folklore its going to be here forever
1761902 i know when i go to school with my kids they dont remember any of the old recordings i did but everybody knows ghostbusters like i did it yesterday
1761903 the toledo zoos executive director ann baker and i first started talking about ways in which our organizations could collaborate about a year and a half ago and out of those discussions came the beginnings of this event
1761904 the whole planning process has been fantastic all of the representatives from the organizations involved have really gone the extra mile everyone really brainstormed on ways in which we could make arts gone wild a groundbreaking cultural event for our community
1761905 all of the arts activities deal with an animal theme this event is something we plan on doing again next year we were fortunate enough to get funding from the ohio arts council to help offset the costs and we will be seeking federal funding from groups such as the nea for future events after this year all of the organizations will meet as a group and take a look at the results and then decide who will host the event next year and what the theme of the works will be
1761906 its quirky and hard to put into a category but it allows me to play rock festivals and blues festivals
1761907 i think i have grown as an artist by living in nashville and hearing new musicians
1761908 there would be me a 19 year old and maybe a friend i would bring along and all these older people but they all kind of adopted us
1761909 i like artists who are quirkier and do their own thing i dont like a lot of the pop stuff that is out there now
1761910 they dont tell me what to do i tell me what to do just this one thing

1761913 i always wished my body looked a bit different but never pursued it beyond that after meeting with dr ditesheim i felt so comfortable and making the changes seemed really within reach he had so much knowledge about procedures and results it made it easy to decide which procedures to move forward with what can i say i am thrilled with my new look
1761914 i cannot even begin to describe how wonderful and liberating it is not to be ashamed of my body anymore finally it is representative of all the effort i have put into maintaining my figure after the birth of my children your service and support has been exceptional and worth every penny

1761917 the chinese governments decision to bar olympic gold medalist joey cheek from attending the olympics because of his advocacy for darfur is reprehensible
1761918 in the coming days president bush will arrive in beijing
1761919 the olympic charter states that any form of discrimination with regard to a country of a person on the grounds of race religion politics gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the olympic movement
1761920 like many americans i recall when joey cheek won the gold medal in 2006 and donated his prize to the children of darfur joey is a magnificent athlete and an optimistic young man and is to be commended for his advocacy and humanitarianism for the people in darfur it is simply wrong for him to be banned from attending the olympic games
1761921 these figures show that northern republic of congo contains the mother lode of gorillas
1761922 it also shows that conservation in the republic of congo is working this discovery should be a rallying cry for the world that we can protect other vulnerable and endangered species whether they be gorillas in africa tigers in india or lemurs in madagascar
1761923 we knew from our own observations that there were a lot of gorillas out there but we had no idea there were so many
1761924 we hope that the results of this survey will allow us to work with the congolese government to establish and protect the new ntokou pikounda protected area
1761925 we hope that these results will speed up the classification of the ntokou pikounda zone into a protected area
1761926 wcs commend the indonesian authorities on their laudable actions in this case the illegal trade in wildlife is now a multi million dollar international business endangered wildlife is being traded for food medicines ornaments pets and more this trade is already driving many species to the brink of extinction if we dont act soon it will be too late
1761927 the police in indonesia have done an excellent job and should be applauded
1761928 we hope that these criminals are prosecuted to the full extent of the law
1761929 while i was running an experiment at the caltech brain imaging center a group of students happened to pass by on a tour and i volunteered to explain what i was doing
1761930 as part of the experiment a moving display was running on my computer screen with dots rapidly expanding out somewhat like the opening scene of star wars
1761931 does anyone else hear something when you look at that
1761932 i queried a few hundred people and three more individuals turned up
1761933 do you hear sounds when you see things move or flash
1761934 people with auditory synesthesia may be even less likely than people with other synesthetic associations to fully realize that their experience is unusual these individuals have an enhanced soundtrack in life rather than a dramatically different experience compared to others
1761935 synesthetes had an advantage because they not only saw but also heard the visual patterns
1761936 this translation might result in actual sound perception in synesthetes perhaps due to stronger than normal connections says saenz who has begun brain imaging experiments to study this connectivity in synesthetes and nonsynesthetes
1761937 we might find that motion processing centers of the visual cortex are more interconnected with auditory brain regions than previously thought even in the normal brain
1761938 at this point very little is known about how the auditory and visual processing systems of the brain work together understanding this interaction is important because in normal experience our senses work together all the time
1761939 we are gratified by montgomery county judge bernard moores decision to deny the bond sought by the american revolution center arc protecting the historic character of valley forge national historical park from this oversized commercialized museum development on private land within park boundaries is a serious matter and our appeal is well founded arcs proposal would forever change valley forge by building a museum a hotel and conference center and parking lots for rvs and buses on what is now historic open meadows and woods an area vital to the continental army encampment recognized for its historical significance the land at risk is eligible for inclusion on the national register of historic places the historic character of valley forge deserves protection and thats the heart of our appeal we remain committed to protecting this national icon for our children and grandchildren to enjoy in a hundred years the historic character of valley forge will be more valuable than any modern development that could be built there today
1761940 will have a strong influence on the outcome of the olympic games and the image the world will have of china in the future
1761941 regardless of todays verdict hamdans trial revealed what is common knowledge the military commissions are fatally flawed and do not adhere to major aspects of the rule of law
1761942 hamdan suffered nearly seven years of unlawful detention only to face a process that falls far short so far the trial continues the bush administrations efforts to escape the rule of law and the requirements of justice
1761943 rather than being dominated by rural farmers tropical deforestation is increasingly driven by major industries especially large scale farming mining and logging
1761944 although this trend is pretty scary its also much easier to target a handful of global corporations than many millions of poor farmers
1761945 green groups are learning to use public boycotts and embarrassment to target the corporate bad guys
1761946 and it already seeing the global soy palm oil and timber industries beginning to change their approach theyre realizing they cant run roughshod over the just too risky for them
1761947 in addition some massive financial firms including goldman sachs jp morgan chase citigroup and bank of america have altered their lending practices after coming under fire from environmentalists
1761948 many multinational corporations are developing greener products because theyre more profitable for example the market for eco friendly timber products is expected to be worth tens of billions of dollars in the u s by 2010
1761949 we argue that the public and green groups need to send a loud clear message to the corporate sector
1761950 from the start this ill sited toll road was fundamentally flawed and environmentally harmful
1761951 the shenanigans began with attempts by the tca an orange county based toll road construction agency to exempt the project from californias strict environmental laws they failed in this endeavor it continued with politically motivated science to justify the toll road and minimize its environmental degradation a fact contributing to a resounding defeat at the california coastal commission this past february now the project is before the bush administration and the commerce department for review
1761952 while we do not oppose toll roads we strongly oppose toll roads through state parks
1761953 this project unnecessarily threatens a state park with a popular campground cultural and native american resources and a pristine beach
1761954 san onofre state beach is one of californias true treasures then gov ronald reagan established the park in 1971 for the enjoyment of all californians this state park is not just another vacant parcel to be pillaged by a toll road construction agency
1761955 the foothill south toll road is the poster child of reckless coastal development and represents the single greatest threat facing our state park system
1761956 if constructed this road would negatively impact coastal water quality and affect the surfing at trestles beach californians need real traffic solutions not toll roads that pave over our state parks
1761957 humans seem to be wired to look to faces to understand the persons intentions
1761958 people are always asking themselves does this person have good or bad intentions
1761959 if you can think of an emotion being communicated by the face as a kind of signal you can understand that we can amplify that signal into what was almost a caricature to see if we get the proper effect
1761960 state parks have increasingly becoming a target and their very existence is being threatened
1761961 we must protect parks for the future based on the comments provided at todays hearing it is clear there is a deep concern among legislators and advocates about the state of our state parks
1761962 when i served in iraq every camera in the world was pointed at abu ghraib and two things happened as a result
1761963 practices at abu ghraib vastly improved but the dark activity which previously happened there went elsewhere techniques in other prison facilities included induced hypothermia smashing hands with hammers and all sorts of activities which clearly are within the bounds of torture by any reasonable humane standard
1761964 we are very pleased we were able to seize them before they were circulated to people in the area and possibly escaped into the wild
1761965 if people turn these frogs in voluntarily we dont have an interest in writing them tickets
1761966 however if we find even more people involved with keeping and selling these frogs we will prosecute at the conclusion of our investigations these amphibians really are a threat to nevada and we have a duty to seize any and all that we find
1761967 but when we go to the pond you can go swimming out there once you learn it will be such fun
1761968 if you even try to ride without you training wheels well go get ice cream in davis square
1761969 un castro no es ni m s ni menos que una aldea fortificada muy habitual entre los siglos vii antes de cristo y el iii de nuestra era
1761970 en estos momentos nuestra labor est dirigida a la difusi n y a la participaci n de la gente a informar de c mo era un poblado t pico de esa poca la divulgaci n en este caso resulta m s interesante que seguir avanzando con las excavaciones
1761971 queremos que los reclusos aprendan cosas que se impliquen en el campo de trabajo pero sobre todo que sepan qu es lo que est n haciendo y por qu lo hacen
1761972 el hecho de poder salir de la c rcel durante estos cinco d as al menos por unas horas supone un premio para nosotros una recompensa contribuye a romper la rutina de la prisi n que es brutal y que desestructura el tiempo que estamos en el campo tenemos una sensaci n de casi libertad
1761973 nunca antes hab a vivido en galicia a pesar de que mis abuelos son gallegos as que poder ver y tocar todo esto hace mucha ilusi n
1761974 sobre todo porque me apasiona la historia y la arqueolog a
1761975 la historia la puedes leer y aprender en los libros
1761976 pero los conocimientos que sacamos de una experiencia directa como sta en el campo es nica
1761977 mi compa ero de celda particip el a o pasado en la excavaci n y me hab a hablado muy bien del proyecto
1761978 soy de aqu al lado de vilagarc a de arousa y estaba harto de ver castros por todas partes pero lo cierto es que nunca supe muy bien qu es lo que eran ni para qu serv an participar en este programa me est ayudando a comprender mejor las costumbres y modos de vida de nuestros antepasados me permite conocer de d nde venimos y encima me siento til
1761979 tengo compa eros que ya est n libres y que en ocasiones vienen a vernos a las salidas a las que nos llevan se acercan a visitarnos y eso es muy bonito
1761980 lo peor es cuando nos metemos en el autob s camino de la c rcel
1761981 y con todo lo que he aprendido en este tiempo ya empiezo a entender mejor muchas cosas que antes desconoc a
1761982 deber amos contar con muchas m s actividades de este estilo
1761983 nos beneficiamos nosotros que podemos salir de la c rcel por unas horas y adem s hacemos una labor social importante
1761984 estoy a punto de salir en libertad y mi novia tambi n

1761990 we are introducing this squad leader level leadership course to assist the indonesian army to develop confident and competent ncos and they can extract the relevant information that were training and mold it into a course that they can teach their ncos in the future
1761991 they are going about it the right way by giving them attributes to become efficient leaders so they can establish that confidence in the nco corps
1761992 by tending to this seed they have the opportunity to help that seed to grow into a more capable military
1761993 at their level in their army theyre just given an order they dont actually get a chance or the opportunity to plan or make the decisions its the officer that makes every decision
1761994 normally they wait for somebody to tell them what to do so what we try to teach them is that theyre the one in charge they make the decisions
1761995 each day we tackled a part of the creed and then made sure it was understood the meaning and then go into ways to apply the meaning
1761996 the first couple of aars no questions were asked it was pretty quiet not a lot of interaction it was like pulling teeth to get them to comment but now they talk to one another

1761999 this enhances their capabilities while strengthening their units at the platoon and company level and will eventually be a combat multiplier at the highest levels within their army
1762000 i would like to see nco academies within their training command that provide the necessary background in leadership fundamentals warrior tasks and battle drills to their soldiers and ncos at different levels much like our wlc basic nco course and advanced nco course
1762001 the wlc makes me proud to be an nco because i understand the nco has an important function for the army like a backbone
1762002 i am very proud of what you have accomplished in the short time you have been here with the challenges you had to overcome
1762003 you are making history in your own country and i ask that you all go out there and do your job to the best of your ability hold your head high and never forget that it is important to be a leader
1762004 nonlethal options allow soldiers to react with an appropriate level of force based on the situation prior to resorting to lethal force
1762005 it channels the air out the tires to slow the car down so they wouldnt have enough speed to make it through the gate

1762013 subjecting individuals to a substantial risk of future harm can be cruel and unusual punishment if the conditions presenting the risk are sure or very likely to cause serious illness and needless suffering

1762021 with a secret docket and closed hearings legal professionals the public and the press have no glimpse of the courts administration of justice

1762024 i dont think the judges ruling went far enough regarding starrs motion because the presumption is always going to be in favor of total transparency and openness in terms of court files
1762025 you still havent achieved that openness and transparency such that people can understand what is happening in the case
1762026 all we have is montalvos word which was trust me
1762027 public access plays a significant positive role in the functioning of the particular process in question
1762028 so a reviewing court can determine whether the closure order was properly ordered
1762029 usually when a court is allowed to seal its for a very limited period of time and for an articulated reason
1762030 here we have something thats been going on for four years thats not what the narrowness requires
1762031 you never see this ongoing veil of secrecy going on in cases the way we have in this cases
1762032 this court is not asking anyone to trust me because i say so
1762033 instead the court is suggesting that the public should trust the system because the procedures in place have withstood the test of time
1762034 although we tend to equate transparency with openness no investigation of this nature and magnitude can proceed unimpeded without the level of confidentiality discussed in this memorandum opinion under the circumstances permitting the requested public scrutiny would obliterate the possibility of conducting the investigation
1762035 el emblema de la cruz roja debe ser respetado porque es el emblema de la neutralidad de la humanidad

1762048 there is no evidence that gen mattis relied on col ewers for any information opinions or legal advice
1762049 instead the record shows gen mattis to be an independent commander highly unlikely to be prone to manipulation by his staff officers
1762050 gen mattis used the word never 10 times in answering questions about whether col ewers had provided any legal advice with respect to chessanis case or any haditha case
1762051 never spoke to me about this case nor would i have asked him for any information or advice a strict firewall was maintained

1762076 i cannot describe to you what it is like to see a dead american soldier
1762077 looking at photographs of the gravely wounded or dead is a profoundly affecting and emotional experience
1762078 however i do feel that it is my duty as a journalist to see that a truthful account of the consequences of war is given
1762079 death and carnage are not the whole story of war there is also heroism and frustration success and setback camaraderie and on occasion atrocity but death and carnage are part of the story and to launder them out of our account of the war would be a disservice

1762089 how much you drive is a crucial factor in how much you get charged on your auto insurance if people drive fewer miles they get in fewer accidents its that simple our estimate is that people who are cutting back in major ways should be able to save 10 15 on their auto insurance premiums
1762090 most companies look at whether you drive fewer than 10 000 miles a year or more than 10 000 miles a year so if youre cutting back and it takes you down below that 10 000 mile limit you likely could save some money

1762216 beauty is not in the face beauty is a light in the heart
1762217 we are very grateful for the tremendous start we had in this game
1762218 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1762219 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1762220 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand

1762226 it was the hardest decision of my career and im suffering a lot to have to let go of my dream
1762227 we fought during four years to get to the olympics and i wont be able to be by larissa on the court
1762228 its not easy to make this decision after so many days of suffering and sacrifice im sorry that she is not in condition to be by my side in this moment that we had dreamed so much for our careers
1762229 i tried everything grabbed all the possibilities given to me by the professionals who evaluated me but unfortunately i reached my limit
1762230 we knew that this could have happened but we always worked with the expectation that i would play
1762231 there was no more time for doubts and the decision had to me mine
1762232 i thought a lot about it and realized that it wouldnt be fair to larissa the technical staff and the brazilian people for me to play without the ideal conditions to do well in the olympics
1762233 i know some people may question why i didnt make this decision earlier
1762234 but i ask would someone give up their dream this easily without fighting until the last minute

1762244 maybe thats my fault for not opening up more or maybe its just me growing up and realizing that friendships are not going to look how they did when i was 14
1762245 weve already had those meetings this is what i find somewhat amusing ibec said at four oclock on saturday morning this was their full and final proposal

1762255 he blocked at the point of attack well and caught the ball well that was a performance we were really glad to see

1762296 religious institutions that use government power in support of themselves and force their views on persons of other faiths or of no faith undermine all our civil rights moreover state support of an established religion tends to make the clergy unresponsive to their own people and leads to corruption within religion itself erecting the wall of separation between church and state therefore is absolutely essential in a free society

1762305 i think its such a politically charged topic what do you do with these exotic animals
1762306 theres never been any problem with them mistreating the animals or problems with the enclosures
1762307 if theres going to be more regulations put someone on the job who knows what theyre doing
1762308 allowing it to enter the enjoining enclosure and kill an adult female tiger
1762309 ill say only that both science fiction and fantasy are forms of literature that permit the imagination of alternatives alternative societies polities cultures rules of gender ideas of religion etc etc and in doing so they have a great role in cultivating the rational use of the imagination in freeing minds from the dead hand of rigid irrational ideologies

1762319 from the beginning of my management of starbucks i wanted it to be the employer of choice the company everybody wanted to work for by paying more than the going wage in restaurants and retail stores and by offering benefits that werent available elsewhere i hoped that starbucks would attract people who were well educated and eager to communicate our passion for coffee to my thinking a generous benefits package was a key competitive advantage

1762329 theoretically the clubs could ask their players to go back to europe because they would be entitled to do so
1762330 and if the players do not come back there could be a case of a breach of contract
1762331 it is now the moment for everyone to sit at the table and find a reasonable solution
1762332 of course this could affect the tournament and its in the interest of nobody to destroy what could be an extraordinary tournament this year but this is a matter for clubs fifa and the players to decide
1762333 will be on the start list for tomorrow from the beginning and i am sure he can be here with us for the rest of the competition
1762334 this decision does not affect the eligibility status of the players who have been validly entered by their national olympic committee and who remain fully eligible to compete
1762335 fifa is surprised and disappointed by this decision but we respect it
1762336 nevertheless i appeal to the clubs let your players take part in the olympic games
1762337 the olympic football tournaments are a unique opportunity for a player as they are high level competitions that give everyone involved most notably young players the chance to gain international experience that will stand them in good stead for the future
1762338 i regret that the cas has not taken the olympic spirit into consideration

1762341 that both his leisure and property businesses are in the hands of administrators
1762342 there is far too much interference with business in bournemouth i think that has destroyed the town we carried on as if cheap flights and package holidays didnt exist i dont think families want to come here the real problem is that bournemouth has never had a business plan nobody ever wants to accept that bars and clubs are important and employ lots of people

1762428 we cant drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok
1762429 i t certainly appears that the republicans are telling a pretty bald faced lie about obama here of course that wouldnt be so new or surprising either would it
1762430 when john mccain gets up there and says id rather win an election than win a war when he says i didnt visit the troops when i was overseas even though every media outlet says thats just not true it suggests you are not trying to solve problems all you are trying to do is divide people so you can win an election that is nothing to be proud of lets have a real honest debate about policies that are going to make a difference in peoples lives
1762431 according to a recent poll by the national womens law center women feel the impact of economic insecurity and rising food energy education and health care costs more deeply than men and see government as a key to the solution
1762432 african leaders must come together to open dialogue among ourselves for conversation and learning about what works
1762433 we should not be afraid to take controversial steps as long as we are caring and careful of peoples rights
1762434 really what is happening doesnt have anything to do with race
1762435 if you have 20 in your pocket are you going to spend it on entertainment or a box of condoms for a lot of people condoms are at the bottom of their list
1762436 if americans were as viscerally aware of the punishing rate and impact of health spending as they are over hikes at the pump anger over health care inflation would make the discontent over energy costs look mild
1762437 legislators are going to have to weigh the power of the vote against the power of the lobbyists dollar
1762438 more leverage to bargain for higher wages a secure retirement and other increased benefits
1762439 cant afford to let the perfect be the enemy of the good

1762443 dramatic shift for some ob gyn practices especially those that are currently testing only pregnant patients patients at high risk and or patients upon request
1762444 rates of infection among african americans and also among hispanics are much higher than among white women sixty four percent of women with hiv are black even though blacks only make up about 13 of the u s population

1762448 this is a stunning development for which we should all be grateful
1762449 that even as we keep working globally we need to do much more to fight aids at home and i intend to do so with my foundation
1762450 i have been extremely disappointed with the clinton foundation especially with it headquartered in harlem of all places that it has been silent
1762451 im very grateful and it is appropriate that president clinton is committed to taking this on
1762452 making inappropriate payments on behalf of recipients residing and enrolled in other states medicaid programs
1762453 a totally devastating study which shows that there are no real meaningful controls on who is getting medicaid
1762454 when the predominance of the disease within the gay community led to a homophobic backlash
1762455 in mexico not all men who have sex with men consider themselves gay so they arent being reached by gay outreach organizations
1762456 there is a whole cultural identity and stigma around the disease
1762457 for the government and the decision makers were the scum of society
1762458 so to spend money on us brings them little political benefit
1762459 that would mean that accepting its a generalized problem and that if you let it grow there will be a huge cost for the country
1762460 been anywhere close to what the costs of dentistry are
1762461 selenas an amazing girl and anybody would be lucky to be dating her
1762462 well like i said anybody would be lucky to be dating her

1762467 any of the various procedures including the prescription and administration of any drug or the performance of any procedure or any other action that results in the termination of the life of a human being in utero between conception and natural birth whether before or after implantation
1762468 quite an expansion of health workers longstanding right not to be involved in abortion
1762469 more accepted for health care workers to inflict their moral judgments on patients
1762470 only anti choicers apparently have moral believes that entitle them to jobs they refuse to actually perform
1762471 tak ing away womens right to get legal reproductive health care in a timely and respectful fashion
1762472 om hon ljuger om det h r kan hon ljuga om allt annat
1762473 in a nutshell they did not balance their checkbook they did not compare their bank statements to the books the county keeps
1762474 a variance between the financial institutions balance and the county treasurers cash balance of 813 456
1762475 all they found so far and they may still be looking is 226 000
1762476 this was over a period of august until the end of the year for 2007
1762477 during the process of gathering information to prepare the countys financial report for 2007 it came to our attention that the treasurer has not balanced the main checking account since may 2007
1762478 by these deposits not being paid in the departments they belong to did not have access to this money for expenditures and may not balance for grant reporting
1762479 indicated that she has little desire to make this a priority
1762480 although we are always willing to provide assistance when necessary it is ultimately the responsibility of the treasurer to make sure the account balance s monthly
1762481 i dont recall getting a copy this was back in march
1762482 we were trying to get the second or first half tax collection over with and i had little desire to make this a priority
1762483 i dont care for that at all thats not larry beidelschies thats someone else talking i dont remember receiving it this is a political thing this is a political year and im up for re election we did have a meeting over this i believe
1762484 but certainly they are things the county should be aware of and they need to fix for the future as far as severity is concerned the auditor would say any findings are important and they need to be addressed
1762485 incorporate anti climb anti tunnel and anti perching features as well as convey an image of impenetrability
1762486 who as the head of an inter university board opposed efforts by the government earlier this year to lift the head scarf ban
1762487 said a shift in his stance on offshore oil drilling is a necessary compromise with republicans to gain their support for his broader goals of energy independence
1762488 i want to be absolutely clear to everybody about this if i thought that i could provide you some immediate relief on gas prices by drilling off the shores of california and new jersey if i thought that by drilling offshore we could solve our problem id do it
1762489 the deals all set but even as they pile up endless billions of dollars in profits they still refuse to give up their corporate welfare handouts which we know you hate so much so thats why your gasoline is going to keep getting more expensive because exxonmobil refuses to take 11 billion instead of 11 5 and their waterboys in congress are worried about getting less in bribes er campaign contributions thats why the republicans are holding up the drilling deal
1762490 the world bank has pressured countries to eliminate their own reserve programs much like the u s eliminated theirs and the eu and china reduced their buffer stock programs
1762491 countries like kenya and malawi were forced by the world bank to sell off their reserves that was partly because of fiscal austerity reasons but it was also partly to repay debt to the world bank
1762492 those included a lot of regional storage programs that were used to take in crops and bring them to market but also as a reserve against times of crisis for high food prices and a hedge against low supply
1762493 were now in a situation where theres no buffer to protect people from a severe food crisis
1762494 more of the same bad medicine the next round of wto talks at doha will present a new opportunity but its really just more of the same and more of the same in the current environment wont help farmers and consumers in the developing world or here at home
1762495 countries like kenya and malawi were forced by the world bank to sell off their reserves that was partly because of fiscal austerity reasons but it was also partly to repay debt to the world bank

1762519 last october we were the first to deliver a full review of devicevms splashtop which was an instant on embedded linux distribution at the time found on a lone asus motherboard since then there has been a commitment to splashtop on all asus motherboards and even on asus notebooks while asus has been the primary partner with devicevm up to this point other manufacturers are exploring this market one of our few gripes about splashtop is that its limited in the current applications available and doesnt allow for much tweaking with no terminal access however members of the phoronix forums have hacked splashtop they have been able to run splashtop from a usb stick on non asus motherboards boot splashtop within a virtual machine run custom applications and launch a terminal within this proprietary linux environment
1762520 when buying a hard disk drive most users are only concerned with the drives capacity should you also care about performance we compared the performance of nine mainstream 250 gb sata 300 hard disk drive models from seagate samsung western digital maxtor and hitachi is there a big performance difference among them is it worthwhile to pay a little bit more and get a drive with a bigger buffer if so which is the fastest 250 gb in the market check it out
1762521 the asus lion square heatsink is a cylindrical tower of nickel plated aluminum fins wrapped around a 92mm pwm fan suspended in the center of it all from the outside only the erie blue glow of the sunon maglev fan is visible its noise is muffled to moderately audible levels the edges of all fins are bent down about 10 15 degrees with a portion of the edge punched out to improve airflow its a unique approach for certain
1762522 while the lubix didnt do very well with music it did a much better job with calls the main reason for this is because you dont need super high quality sound reproduction when you are talking over a cellphone since the compression applied by the carrier already knocks the quality down i found these suitable for listening to calls and the people on the other side of the phone had no complaints either while it is a little different to have something in both ears for a phone call it wasnt too bothersome
1762523 todays double slot width passive cooler works quiet well it is made with higher quality materials and is able to rapidly radiate excess heat
1762524 we had a chance to ask robert krakoff also known as razerguy a few questions regarding razers new products development of budget gaming mouse salmosa new mako audio system e sport in general and their vision of pc gamings future

1762528 nvidia has just launched the new 9800 gt which is basically the old 8800 gt so they havent really launched a new product rather a new name the renaming of cards is becoming a bit of a pain in the ass but really there isnt a whole lot we can do about it the best thing we can do is help keep people educated so they dont upgrade from an 8800 gt to a 9800 gt or an 8800 gs to a 9600 gso the thing is though these new cards come with new pricing which tends to be lower than their original counterpart which means that they become more competitive than ever and thats something were not going to complain about
1762529 todays article will be a complete antipode to the previous now we are interested in low end processors instead of top products these processors are manufactured for a reason arent they so well find out what they can do and how fast
1762530 after tabulating the results cpu temps are kept well within very reasonable levels across the entire spectrum of testing while standard system use is really good at a full 1ghz overclock we start to see the limitations of copper and heat pipes as is the case with most every air cooler above these frequencies most every cooler starts to suffer simply due to physics if youre cranking out the insane frequencies beyond this youll naturally want to consider water cooling the speed and ease of the installation coupled with the performance have me considering recommending the sunbeamtech core contact freezer as the ideal cooler for those who build gaming or performance systems
1762531 if you dont follow almost daily the video card market it is really complicated to understand the differences between the several different nvidia graphics chips available on the market today to facilitate knowing and understanding the difference among these chips we have compiled the following table

1762535 im of two minds on this wireless sd card its clever unique relatively inexpensive and essentially universal its pretty in a memory card sort of way it has a couple of flaws that would be far from deal breakers if as a whole hardware and software it just did more without raw image support this eye fi creation will never be the memory card for professionals without open wireless networking support it wont help the traveling photographer the direct to online photo service feature is cool but indiscriminate posting every underexposed blurred up nostril without remorse
1762536 a true love story thats what the mummy and the mummy returns are at heart you could say there is some action some adventure mummies iffy egyptian mythology cinematic interpretation of world history and lots of cheeky one liners all tossed in there too just for fun i didnt really like these movies the first time i watched them i wasnt looking forward to seeing them again hey im being honest this time i had more fun and discovered that the love story between the lead characters is the of the heart whole shebang
1762537 thermaltake thoughpower 1500 w is probably the most power pc power supply in the world so powerful that it cant be sold in the usa as it is over the maximum allowed power for household appliances set by the underwriter laboratories ul which is 1 300 w by the way because of that this model can only be found in europe the architecture used is really interesting this power supply is in fact two completely independent 750 w power supplies inside the same housing besides its monstrous power capability which the manufacturer says can be delivered at 50 c with a peak power of 1 600 w thoughpower 1500 w has a modular cabling system with a total of eight power connectors for video cards and a 140 mm fan in this article we will completely dissect this monster
1762538 the thermaltake duorb cpu cooler provides more than just cpu cooling the dual fan design cools the entirety of the upper portion of the motherboard in addition to the cpu the duorb includes double sided radiant heatpipes disperse the heat through the extensive number of fins surround each fan the mirror coated copper base provides even better heat dissipation between the contact surface and the cpu over other cpu coolers read on further for the full review
1762539 here at tweaktown i often get questions about whether or not blu ray x will work in an australian or american blu ray player so i thought it would be a good time to write a guide about blu ray importing lets begin similar to dvd region coding where the world is split up into six geographic regions blu ray is split into three geographic regions fortunately unlike dvd the splitting of blu ray regions are far more sensible
1762540 the eagle consus external hard drive enclosure does a great job doing what it was meant to do there really isnt a lot to say in conclusion as it neither really came out and wowed me but it also didnt disappoint typical transfer speeds were seen even when equipped with a hard drive that can handle much faster however it still did beat out the other external hard drives in all but one metric the sturdy feel of the casing makes me feel comfortable dropping an expensive drive in and not really needing to worry much about damage it might encounter eagles attention to packaging and included accessories was a nice surprise that most manufacturers miss the target on overall the eagle consus does just what it is supposed to do
1762541 its a full on production dealing with this many people but this is the 13th time for quakecon hopefully its their lucky number
1762542 today we are going to look at a very nice case of the iphone that is also available for the new iphone 3g the case is called the griffin wave for iphone several colors are available and the case protects the screen and leaves all the controls easily accessible the edges of the case are beveled so that they are comfortable against your ear and face when the phone is in use when the griffin wave for iphone is installed it does add a bit of bulk to the phone but not much obviously you can no longer place the phone into the docking cradle when the case is on but the sync charge cable itself fits with the case installed without any issues
1762543 earlier this month intel had announced the gma x4500 series which is their latest and greatest when it comes to integrated graphics processors these igps were greeted by same day linux support it had actually arrived before the chipset was announced but its still next to impossible to find motherboards using the g43 and g45 chipsets that bear this igp fortunately however our friends at super micro have come through and we have managed to get our hands on the c2sea the super micro c2sea is an atx motherboard that uses the intel g45 chipset in conjunction with an ich10 southbridge this motherboard provides intel gma x4500hd graphics with vga and hdmi interfaces in this article we are looking at the performance of this new intel graphics processor under linux
1762544 this card was a bit tough to overclock because the temperatures held it back i was able to get the card from the stock gpu clock speed of 625mhz all the way up to 675mhz the memory went up from the stock frequency of 990mhz up to 1075mhz overall thats a pretty good overclock especially since this card was overclocked 35mhz more on the gpu and 30mhz more on the memory than the powercolor hd 4850 that its competing against with an aftermarket cooler im sure this card would be able to go much higher than what i got it at
1762545 several pc companies came out to show their support of gaming amd intel dell kingston and cyber power were the big names of the show but several others had smaller displays as well each company used their own methods to attract gamers some gave away loads of products and others had exotic booth babes a few companies simply let their products speak for themselves with so many gamers in attendance all were successful quakecon was a perfect spot for these companies to showcase their products to users while many attendees were only roaming the vendor halls looking for free swag several were knowledgeable consumers looking to make their purchasing decision based on the companies that support their growing sport

1762548 the thermaltake maxorb heatsink is a novel design based around a half dozen heatpipes and six individual arcs of cooling fins i have to wonder if its design was born out of a desire not to infringe on existing patents rather than sheer innovation but in any event the approach here guarantees an even fin pitch across the complete cooling surface area in that respect the maxorb breaks new ground allowing it to stand out from heatsinks of similar shape
1762549 the last time we looked at a silverstone lascala chassis was back in 2006 when reviewing the silverstone lc20m which boasted an aluminum front panel plenty of room for storing extra hard drives and even a vfd panel with ir receiver we are back today though with the lascala series as we explore the lc13 e which promises next generation cooling performance a highly compatible chassis layout magnificent front panel design and at a price that most can afford

1762560 it would be very very hard not to covet this video card i know i recently said that the 9800 gtx was the sexy card but this one might actually look nicer eye of the beholder and all and its not just skin deep its faaast and because of that we can overlook its frightening heat production and power consumption but it isnt a bargain thanks to price warring its in the you gotta be crazy and not the price is no question bracket and because of that itll get more attention than it might deserve its compelling after all especially the idea of quad sli not that id turn one down but the people for whom it makes sense are fewer than the people that can afford it that is to say its a great piece of hardware but its only a good idea in the strictest of circumstances
1762561 today for review ive got an excellent product from thecus its the n3200 nas box and it is a truly feature rich product that can add a new dimension to your storage capabilities of your home network
1762562 on the flip side i did go into this review with high hopes considering the other black series boards i have tested but i was left with a sour taste when it came to the overclocking side of the review this board just did not like any increase i threw at it i only achieved a 34mhz boost which is the lowest overclock i have ever gotten i attribute this to the weak overclocking options in the bios because even raising the vcore to 1 47v could not get me any higher another thing you might want to look out for is the ide port placement which is at the bottom of the board this might pose some severe problems for those of you who use ide based optical drives with large cases i was surprised to see that the pci express x16 ports are limited to x8 electrically when two cards are placed in a crossfirex configuration but considering the bandwidth that pci e 2 0 brings to the table this should not be an issue
1762563 bfg offers several different models of power supplies from the value oriented gs to the modular mx series all the way up to their top of the line es 800 they have something for every need and budget the one i have for review today is the ls 550 which seems to fall somewhere in the middle of their lineup despite the relatively smallish power rating the ls 550 offers quad 12v rails 6 and 8 pin pcie and atx 2 2 version compatibility all backed up by an impressive 5 year warranty
1762564 today i have for review a new product from kingston its a 3gb 2x1 5gb hyperx ddr2 5300 low latency 4 4 4 12 memory kit designed for notebook installations now you dont have to be limited to your desktop rig to have great brand name and performance memory my current laptop an hp dv9500t had 2gb ddr2 667mhz and now runs on this 3gb kingston kit lets see how i got there
1762565 we saw the 9800 gtx launch a little bit back but samples have been scarce and stock has been even harder to get a hold of its been a while since weve seen a card be a paper launch but it seemed the 9800 gtx was exactly that it was designed to help draw attention away from the release of the new amd cards today were not only looking at a standard gtx but the overclocked model from asus that comes in under the top naming scheme lets have a quick look at the package and the card along with what asus has done with the core shader and memory clock

1762568 ddr3 has been progressing slowly but at a steady pace and its not looking like stopping while the jedec officially only supports 1333mhz ddr3 on its records intel has gone a step further something we wouldnt have expected them to do theyve pushed the boundaries of ddr3 by introducing the xmp profiles that allow speeds of 1600mhz and very soon 1800mhz on its x38 and x48 chipsets with ddr3 memories while this may seem quite impressive its still not enough not when the 2000mhz barrier is in sight and quite a few companies are pushing to reach it corsair says it has managed to hit speeds well beyond that

1762635 the beauty of the marketing angle was how it appealed to women
1762636 what we did was appeal to womens mindsets we created a product that is comfortable women love the practicality of the gear but more importantly women like their asses to be checked out they want men to look at their asses and if they are working out and taking care of their bodies they want to be rewarded with stares whistles cat calls and even a nice little pat if its deserved and this product is the most ass friendly on the market women have no choice but to put it on and be creeped upon

1762670 we are pleased with our better than expected fourth quarter results
1762671 the false statement on mortgages ltd s web site highlights why an independent trustee must be put in place immediately as current managements misconduct is only becoming progressively worse
1762672 the story that a glitch magically wrote a statement for mortgages ltd would be comical if the deception of the public was not so serious
1762673 several of you may have heard or recently read that over the weekend attorneys for rightpath filed an emergency motion for an order converting our case to a chapter 7 bankruptcy or alternatively for an appointment of a chapter 11 trustee we are pleased to report that late this afternoon the court denied this motion
1762674 well the last thing we want to do is mislead investors i am sure this was just a glitch
1762675 mortgages ltd president rich feldheim and his staff and mine have had countless meetings with many investors so it is just not realistic to believe the company which very much wants to pay these people would try to mislead them
1762676 the mist in the air that we see in those places including here is not a feature of pollution primarily but a feature of evaporation and humidity

1762698 our new site re establishes quepasa as the premiere destination for latinos online the new website design coupled with our well known brand name added social networking features and technical enhancements have driven tremendous user activity and growth
1762699 there is an apparent need to serve the growing latino online audience especially young latinos who are fueling the growth
1762700 we redesigned the site with them in mind by creating fun interactive new features and a variety of user friendly enhancements that will provide our members with a rich online experience we plan to continue innovating to create an unmatched online experience for our unique audience
1762701 the texas sheriffs conference was a huge success for us word of mouth advertising of both the ez card system and the ez kiosk system caused a real buzz around the floor of the show
1762702 with several final contract negotiations wrapping up this month and several installs scheduled for late august cpsz is on track to meet and exceed our annual revenue forecasts
1762703 we have recently signed a loi with a large southwest commissary contractor and are very close to completing the deal i am very confident we can start implementing numerous kiosk installs in their contracted facilities by the start of the fourth quarter the initial install will be a 245 bed facility in tennessee
1762704 the company has no exposure to the sub prime lending issue that has affected many banks however like most banks in florida we have been hard hit by the soft economy weakening credit quality and depressed real estate values as a result our impaired loans have increased significantly as have our provision for loan losses in 2008 over 2007 consumers overall have been hard hit by the economic downturn and we are experiencing an increase in our past due loans which has further necessitated an increase in our loan loss reserves
1762705 i am happy to report that our sixth branch on gatlin boulevard in port st lucie florida opened in may of 2008 this is our third branch in st lucie county florida which now provides greater access to our services and allows us to reach a broader base of community individuals and businesses a fifth branch opened in the first quarter of 2008 on martin downs boulevard in palm city florida however the effects of opening two branches in 2008 will continue to negatively impact our earnings until the branches mature and become profitable
1762706 because of the two new branch openings this year modest losses were predicted for 2008 however over 77 of our 2008 net loss before tax can be attributed to the higher levels of loan loss provision that the current depressed economy has required to help mitigate the losses in 2008 management has taken immediate measures to reduce overhead including staff and benefits reduction
1762707 the company continues to be well capitalized at 10 79 total risk based capital at june 30 2008 and despite the dramatic stress that is upon our industry and the nation in general the board and management of fpb bancorp inc are committed to overcoming the challenges brought forth by the current economic conditions
1762708 while second quarter earnings were disappointing i feel that we are well positioned to grow our company by executing these strategies while continuing our practice of disciplined underwriting
1762709 il est hors de question daugmenter la tva sur des produits alimentaires surtout dans un contexte de difficult s de pouvoir dachat pour les fran ais

1762713 we are satisfied with our results for the second quarter of 2008 which were not only in line with previously stated consolidated guidance but our second quarter pre tax net loss of 2 5 million was better than our previously stated second quarter 2008 pre tax loss guidance of 3 5 million to 2 9 million additionally it is important to note that 1 8 million of our pre tax loss included depreciation and amortization
1762714 while our lending segment adversely impacted our earnings during the second quarter it is important to note that we also experienced improvement in this segment with its pre tax net loss narrowing considerably and its revenue increasing over the first quarter of 2008 in fact we closed approximately 16 0 million of loans in the second quarter of 2008 an increase from 3 4 million loans in the first quarter of 2008 although we anticipate seeing continued improvement in this segment we have changed our guidance to reflect slower than expected growth due to uncertain economic conditions
1762715 we were also pleased with the solid growth we experienced in both our electronic payment processing and web hosting segments specifically in our electronic payment processing segment we have not experienced abnormal merchant attrition and have been able to maintain our first quarter 2008 ebitda margin of 10 8 percent in the second quarter of 2008 both of which are particularly significant achievements considering the current challenging market environment and the effect it has had on some of our peers
1762716 during the first half of the year we implemented significant cost cutting measures which we believe will result in cash savings of approximately 2 0 million in 2009 the cost cutting has been targeted at areas where growth was not as promising which will allow us to expend greater energy and resources growing the segments we believe will be instrumental in the company achieving profitability on a consolidated basis

1762725 from community activist to illinois senator for 143 days to campaigning for president obama does not have the political experience necessary to lead this country or represent us on a global stage
1762726 hey bleu obama is a us senator not illinois senator and as such he has had more political experience than w had as the governor of texas i might make the argument that mccain has too much experience like forgetting that czechoslovakia is no longer behind the iron curtain

1763054 he helped me open the first sushi nikko in houston this is my first business venture and i was lucky to have someone i knew help me its kinda like having a franchise only better because hes done it many times before he guided us through it
1763055 weve got 57 different kinds of rolls no one else in houston has that plus we have baked rolls
1763056 since not everyone likes sashimi we decided to bake some rolls like our very popular snow cone roll which has albacore lobster crab meat and avocado no one else has that either
1763057 how perfect expected and fortuitous not to mention profitable that tijuana bible evolved as the go to moniker for pornographic mod texts
1763058 not that you need catchy names to move porn but anything sexual with the name tijuana attached to it assured that the consumer would be confronted with some beastly swarthy over the top sexual witnessing that would leave them ready to empty their gonadic profits onto sheets tissues sheep or worse
1763059 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1763060 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1763061 muchas compa as de discos est n promocionando a grupos indies en plan tenemos uno nuevo van en camiseta
1763062 youll be amazed at what happens when a demand is put upon your potential
1763063 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
1763064 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
1763065 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
1763066 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
1763067 you have to do it because you love it not for the money
1763068 i never really prayed or hoped to get famous i just wanted to do something i loved to do

1763071 we have successfully gathered together to find us rednecks in oregon
1763072 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
1763073 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
1763074 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
1763075 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
1763076 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
1763077 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element

1763084 my grandpa used to have a bunch of house parties on the weekend he used to get all his friends together to jam later on we got a radio but we still never listened to it that much because he still had those house parties

1763091 they said jimmy buffet is out there wants to play with you guys

1763104 we have a lot to learn from their success too
1763105 they infinity ward did some very innovative things to keep people going and their experience rewards system was something that we paid a lot of attention to
1763106 its a great game and single player obviously is fantastic
1763107 the way that they use those moments to craft the player experience halo has a lot to learn from

1763111 bmw oracle racing cammas was coming in on starboard while alinghi and oman sail were on port and the team on bmw oracle racing went for the full hands in the air flag waving protest to try and get alinghi penalised we gave them a green flag no penalty but it was a great illustration of just how hard the teams are racing
1763112 these kind of conditions were a bit beyond what weve experienced before and so weve been learning in every race trying to figure it out it was pretty hairy
1763113 we created the ishares cup to be something different and the crash and burn racing weve seen is exactly the kind of product we hoped for
1763114 its designed to deliver exciting and action packed racing to the public and take close quarter sailing to another level
1763115 the ishares cup has attracted a whole new audience enthralled by the entertainment and intense competition the extreme 40 fleet can deliver time and time again the thrills and spills of this kind of racing have grabbed the attention of everyone following the ishares cup at skandia cowes week long may it continue

1763117 the w980s unique clear audio sound means that ushers fans can now hear here i stand exactly as its meant to be heard
1763118 this operation was a successful collaboration that benefited all of southwest florida
1763119 the collier county sheriffs office the lee county sheriffs office and ice worked together to bring about the expeditious removal of foreign nationals who are here illegally and are committing crimes it has already proven to have a positive impact on crime in collier county
1763120 the removal of illegal aliens especially those with a criminal history is one of ices top priorities
1763121 we will continue using all our resources to ensure that removal orders are carried out
1763122 our community is much better off following this successful operation and we pledge our continued support for the eviction of criminal aliens and secured federal borders
1763123 neither sen barack obama nor sen john mccain wants to talk about immigration but the system is broken
1763124 unfortunately neither of them wants to take the tough steps necessary to secure americas borders and institute a realistic policy to cut illegal immigration
1763125 give health insurance to 47 million americans who are now without coverage
1763126 sen obama doesnt plan on giving them coverage he plans on making the taxpayers give them coverage theres a big difference
1763127 its not fair to expect u s taxpayers to pay for health insurance for the citizens of another nation americas bloated welfare state is expensive enough and even after recent reforms it still creates a disincentive to work handing out insurance to people who have come to america illegally will encourage even greater illegal immigration
1763128 and that in turn will push up government health care expenditures creating a vicious cycle of more and more spending and more and more illegal immigration
1763129 instead of increasing the reward for violating the law and americas borders the federal government should move in the other direction it must stop requiring hospital emergency rooms to provide free care for illegal aliens and the courts must stop forcing states to provide free schooling for the children of illegal aliens this means changing the law and perhaps even the constitution but until we do so the government will continue to create a taxpayer funded draw for illegal immigration
1763130 give health insurance to 47 million americans who are now without coverage
1763131 if you are here illegally you are an illegal alien you do not belong here leave now
1763132 get the money because otherwise they are going to kill me
1763133 you have to look at it as services that are being offered to a community who needs them because legally people cannot qualify to enter the country
1763134 no one wants to risk their lives in order to come through so if you could simply establish a system where people could enter flexibly you would deal a very strong blow to the smugglers but as the border has become more fortified smugglers have become increasingly more important they are a necessary evil
1763135 its not unusual for us to get three or four calls a week
1763136 where were responding and going into places that are basically housing between 15 to 30 individuals who have been smuggled we get a lot of call outs and we do a lot of federal prosecutions
1763137 has the unified support of the entire board to a person
1763138 my son whos an attorney said dad i thought you usually represented people who got fired for

1763143 this new prize will help us seek out recognize and honor individuals and organizations that demonstrate the impact of technology on intractable development issues establishing these visionaries as role models for a world ready for new solutions
1763144 history has taught us that technology is a key driver of increased economic prosperity and has the real potential to improve lives in developing countries
1763145 the legatum fortune technology prize is designed to identify the very best technology companies that are bringing innovation to frontier markets around the globe our goal is to highlight new model for effective development and stimulate an escalating cycle of innovation and new investment
1763146 i dont think many people know how to use an abacus so maybe adding a feature that teaches how it works would be cool
1763147 send your data to me the way identi ca does
1763148 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
1763149 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
1763150 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
1763151 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
1763152 our international experience will clearly come into play on this project as we can build on our expertise from projects such as transport for london and main roads western australia effective network management is a common business need throughout the world
1763153 british columbia will need to reference and collect data in a multitude of ways ranging from machine collected road data to manual network reclassification the exor solution will unify and simplify british columbias ability to produce location based accuracy using gps technology improved access and user participation web based services and improved performance management it will improve their ability to deliver improved services to all interested parties and stakeholders
1763154 public officials have to keep a very close watch on public finances
1763155 no one should have the opportunity to play fast and loose with taxpayer dollars personnel charged with handling cash should be properly supervised and there have to be controls in place to ensure that employees arent losing or stealing the publics money
1763156 theres no noise no checking the oil or how much gas youve got you just get on and go

1763169 the price of gasoline is one of the most critical issues facing floridians right now its adversely affecting families and businesses alike we need a comprehensive solution to address this crisis
1763170 this bill will do a great deal to put our nation on a path to cleaner renewable energy alternatives while also addressing current needs americans want and deserve real solutions to lower fuel costs our bill is a step in that direction
1763171 while this allows the development of offshore oil and natural gas exploration by states wishing to do so this measure protects floridas moratorium in the gulf of mexico
1763172 i asked that this bill include protections for floridas wishes and those protections are included in this bill
1763173 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages

1763193 remember the whiny insecure kid in nursery school the one who always thought everyone was out to get him and was always running to the teacher with complaints chances are he grew up to be a conservative
1763194 at least he did if he was one of 95 kids from the berkeley area that social scientists have been tracking for the last 20 years the confident resilient self reliant kids mostly grew up to be liberals

1763208 the population of somalia is facing serious food shortages and the world food program has indicated that current food stocks in somalia will be depleted by mid august
1763209 it has also been stated that if these supplies are not renewed somalia would suffer a severe famine
1763210 this re assignment will not put them at any more risk than they would have been in under their original assignment having said that pirates by their very nature are very unpredictable
1763211 i had a discussion with the secretary general of nato jaap de hoop scheffer about the potential for canada to participate suffice as to say we are part of a relatively small number of countries capable of providing this type of escort and the decision was taken then to participate
1763212 the fact somalia is struggling through civil war and never really regenerated out of the 90s means it doesnt have a navy it doesnt have a seaborne police force of any consequence that it can use to stop this piracy
1763213 in a place like somalia where food is so scarce food becomes a source of power he who maintains power over the food supply maintains power period

1763234 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

1763238 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
1763239 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
1763240 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt

1763243 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
1763244 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
1763245 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package

1763268 i never really considered georgia until i went down there the first time and was just blown away by the experience
1763269 so my family and i want to go back and see if i feel the same way this time as i did the first time
1763270 well have to see what happens how everything goes i definitely plan on making a decision before my first high school game on sept 12 if not sooner
1763271 during my first visit we got to sit down and eat dinner with georgia coach mark richt

1763275 im probably in the best condition in my life i guess
1763276 its good being able to be confident that im in good shape and that my feet are fast hopefully it will translate onto the field
1763277 it matters and it shows the coaching staff and your teammates your focus
1763278 to get in that kind of condition it takes work it takes discipline it takes sacrifice it takes a focus
1763279 i really think that matthew stafford when its all said and done with the talent around him and watching and looking at him these last couple of days throw the football its hard for me to imagine a better looking physical specimen in simply getting back and distributing the football than matthew stafford
1763280 this guy is going to have a huge year and when its all said and done maybe the best quarterback and maybe the first pick if he decides to leave early for the nfl draft
1763281 im throwing it about as well as i have definitely since ive been here
1763282 it kind of feels like back in high school when you just feel like youre on on every throw
1763283 that equates into a quicker player and a guy who has more stamina
1763284 lets say your in a game and you run for 12 yards and you get your jaw jacked and you run back to the huddle and youve got to run the next play if youre in better condition you have a much better chance to recover in time to play full speed again

1763297 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
1763298 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
1763299 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
1763300 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

1763306 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
1763307 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
1763308 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs

1763310 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
1763311 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
1763312 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
1763313 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
1763314 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
1763315 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
1763316 we might well start 2008 09 with largely the squad we had last season and after all they didnt do too badly we are still researching and looking but it is not easy and certainly we are not desperate i think we already have the men for the job
1763317 ferguson has not added to his champions league winning squad despite being linked with a host of big name targets
1763318 despite a growing injury list that looks certain to keep cristiano ronaldo wayne rooney and half a dozen other senior men out of the opening premier league game against newcastle on august 17 ferguson may keep his cash where it is
1763319 fergie warns spurs im happy with my squad and may give up hunt for berbatov
1763320 which suggests he may be resigning himself to losing the battle to sign dimitar berbatov
1763321 so john ingram said to peter osnos look give us the file and well set it up as an on demand model and well fulfill at least some of those orders
1763322 we got the file from them on the monday morning after bookexpo america and we were printing the first books that afternoon
1763323 we actually moved over our entire casebook production to just that book for a period of 48 hours we printed several thousand copies and those were orders that otherwise would have just been lost or would have not been fulfilled when the offset order came back in we switched it off
1763324 its short run i dont want to have to differentiate anymore between digital and offset were focusing on making it seamless for the publishing community as far as how a book is made

1763332 theres no best practice or rule of thumb yet theres room for anyone to come in and become a dominant network
1763333 evolved in many ways we would not have predicted when we launched
1763334 when we appeared at demo and for the first several months we pursued a rather classic definition of a new type of site social media we found over the first several months from user feedback and users that the idea of having another profile another place for your identity beyond the main social networks was becoming burdensome users were feeling profile fatigue
1763335 we started to observe not just with peoplejam but also with other social media sites trying to drive connectivity around content and around lifestyle interests that we dont see any successes in the market
1763336 so we began to evolve the business to drive a different type of value proposition which is much more in the category of being a social utility weve developed to be a social utility for people interested in social improvement launched aug 4 as a component of our site that will be layered on top of the social media
1763337 find customers who have attractive demographics if theres one thing that the web 2 0 experience should have taught us by now its all about targeted small markets

1763343 its the first crowd powered search engine getting information based on what other people have been searching
1763344 the advertising model is the most popular but not necessarily the most desirable ads combined with premium or gated members seem to be best
1763345 i dont think you can be successful these days with less than two million unique visitors sessions per month
1763346 for a social media site depending on revenue from advertising anything less wont be successful and you dont start getting into powerful business models until youre well over five million uniques per month
1763347 companies dont need huge amounts of venture capital and ads to survive guy kawasaki launched his trumors web site for 13 000 where five years ago it would have cost him about a half a million
1763348 is the biggest proponent of george bushs tired failed policies ready to bring about change
1763349 while sen mccain knows that sen obama has proposed cutting taxes for 95 of american families what hes not telling us is that he wants to give 4 billion in tax breaks to the oil companies continue giving tax breaks to corporations that ship our job overseas and provide no direct tax relief for more than 100 million middle class families its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america

1763400 kami akan memperlihatkan kepada mereka tanda tanda kami di segenap ufuk dan sehingga jelaslah bagi mereka bahwa itu benar dan tidakkah cukup bahwa sesungguhnya tuhanmu menyaksikan segala sesuatu
1763401 lalu keduanya digelincirkan oleh syaitan dari jannah itu dan dikeluarkan dari keadaan semula dan kami berfirman allah berfirman turunlah kamu berdua dari jannah bersama sama sebagian kamu menjadi musuh sebahagian yang lain maka jika datang kepadamu petunjuk daripada ku lalu barangsiapa yang mengikuti petunjuk ku ia tidak akan sesat dan ia tidak akan celaka
1763402 apakah engkau mau menjadikan padanya makhluk yang akan membuat bencana padanya dan akan menumpahkan darah padahal kami bertasbih dengan memuji engkau dan memuliakan engkau
1763403 hai adam sesungguhnya ini musuh bagimu dan bagi isterimu maka janganlah ia mengeluarkan kamu berdua dari jannah karena engkau akan menjadi susah

1763493 if you want downtown to be the privileged ghetto of those who can afford condos a half million dollars and up then by all means keep residential heights to below 10 stories but if you want downtown to be street lively hosting a variety of activities and retail then either accept that residential towers of well over 10 stories must be built on downtown parcels or get radical and propose a way the government and the private market can cooperate in building truly affordable ownership housing in structures discreetly and modestly low in height

1763550 jangan sampai kota medan ini dijadikan lautan sampah karena ketidakpedulian pihak pemko medan mengatasi pengelolaan sampah dan harus diingat warga berhak berdasarkan undang undang dan peraturan yang berlaku melakukan tuntutan hukum kepada pemko medan atas ketidak nyamanan pelayanan terhadap warga
1763551 jika itu menjadi alasan seharusnya pemko medan dan dprd medan mengambil langkah langkah kebijakan strategis
1763552 ujar poernomo menurut penilaian poernomo selama ini pihak pemko medan dan instansi terkait terkesan tidak transparan dalam pengelolaan sampah sehingga pihak swasta maupun warga terkesan apatis membantu pihak pemko pola manajemen pemerintahan pemko medan

1763555 would you mind being in the loop on the selection of a new president
1763556 the premier indicated to the chairman of the board of regents that if the university felt it would be helpful the premier if asked would be willing to meet prospective candidates to promote the province to emphasize the importance of memorial to the province and to confirm the governments strong commitment to university education in newfoundland and labrador
1763557 the board feels that there was no inappropriate interference by government or attempt to influence the work of the search committee until government informed the board that the candidates were unacceptable prior to a formal recommendation of a preferred candidate being made
1763558 the board is concerned that governments non acceptance of the candidates and governments request that the search committee continue with its search before a formal recommendation could be made on the boards proposed appointee constitutes inappropriate interference in the normal process
1763559 the memorial university act is clear in delineating governments role and the board of regents is committed to ensuring that role remains within the letter and spirit of the act the boards appointment of a candidate for president must be the result of a fair thorough and comprehensive process that is strictly in accordance with the provisions of the memorial university act
1763560 the board of regents respectfully recommends to government that it amend the memorial university act to better reflect the autonomy of the university and to be more in line with appointment practices at other canadian universities

1763566 ini sangat tidak relevan dengan tujuan pembangunan kota medan yang seharusnya terencana dan terukur bukan sekedar untuk mengejar pendapatan asli daerah yang notabene ternyata tidak jelas penggunaannya
1763567 ini menunjukkan kota medan dibangun tanpa memperhatikan pelestarian lingkungan hidup dan keanekaragaman hayati dan dinas yang menangani masalah lingkungan hidup tidak berfungsi sebagaimana mestinya

1763572 we recognise that there have been strong views expressed about this complex proposal
1763573 ministers thought long and hard about the case and decided the only appropriate decision was to call it in
1763574 there is long established process in place where less than 0 01 of all planning cases are called in
1763575 a case is considered to have more than local significance if it triggers one or more of the call in criteria such as conflict with national policy or if it causes national or regional controversy
1763576 the decision to call in does not consider the merits or otherwise of an application which is a matter for the inspector to consider at inquiry
1763577 having spent more than two years working diligently on a project which would not only provide everton football club with a new home but also regenerate kirkby we had hoped to avoid a government call in
1763578 indeed it was only in june that knowsley borough councils planning committee voted by a majority of 20 to one to grant planning permission
1763579 we shall now engage in detailed discussions with our development partners kbc and tesco to assess what options are open to us
1763580 it is important to stress that this decision does not spell the end of the destination kirkby project but it will self evidently precipitate a period of reflection assessment and re evaluation

1763601 were very excited to be a part of the carteret community
1763602 and sharing mayor reimans vision for redevelopment we should see you by the end of november
1763603 im sure burger express will receive a warm welcome from our residents with whom it has always been popular its modernized design concepts promise a more inviting facility and the continuation of the success it has always enjoyed its a great pleasure to have burger express returning to both our town and our business community

1763620 i was sitting next to jerry colangelo and said you know weve waited three years to get off this plane and do this
1763621 i think were prepared and while were here we need to prepare more
1763622 its a little overwhelming that its really here the reality that were here
1763623 weve been treated with the greatest amount of respect and friendliness we could not have been treated better i know well get the same treatment in beijing the chinese people love basketball and were excited were playing the first game against china
1763624 i try to see american players every time they come to china but this time is the most special because of the olympics
1763625 a once in a lifetime opportunity and they should experience all those things
1763626 i hope to get my team ready to perform at the highest level to win a gold medal thats my only desire here and ill be ok with that
1763627 i think theres a rule for a rule for a rule from my understanding when they read the rule it can be interpreted in different ways there was some gray area there
1763628 i tell you ive never seen anything like this situation this is a first for me
1763629 we have discussed the situation with dwight and have given north carolina permission to speak with him reinhard said
1763630 however at this time he is enrolled at valdosta state and is practicing with our football team we plan on continuing under these pretenses
1763631 carolina is his dream school and its where he wanted to go from the start plus its division i and valdosta state is division ii
1763632 but you look at the situation at valdosta state he really likes the coaches there and the program hes found a home there
1763633 so hes going through a range of emotions right now
1763634 hes a 6 2 6 3 guy who ran a 4
1763635 but hes not just fast he does a great job from the free safety position filling the alley he likes coming up and hitting people
1763636 hes an exceptional athlete southern guilford coach darryl brown said
1763637 he does so many things for our offense he catches the football well hes a good blocker and he can obviously run hes the kind of guy you can move around and do a lot of things with him
1763638 no caeremos en la trampa de entrar al trapo de las provocaciones de zapatero para distraer a la ciudadan a del problema acuciante del caos econ mico consecuencia de su mala gesti n etc
1763639 the tempos been good i told the players the other day i said theres two ways of going about training camp you can work like mules which is not very smart and youd be working hard or you can work like thoroughbreds and i think that theyve chosen the latter
1763640 hes not showed any kind of ill effects so our speculation is that the worst has past certainly this past spring and he should be fine for the rest of the fall
1763641 one of the real pleasant surprises is the defensive line
1763642 their intensity trying to develop that depth marvin austin obviously is doing a very good job but aleric mullins and tydreke powell and cam thomas all four of those guys are going to be extraordinarily instrumental to having a good four man rotation inside
1763643 he was bigger stronger and more physical at the point of attack hes doing some really good stuff and greg elleby is doing a really nice job so the defensive line is off to a very good start
1763644 hes very very fast hes smart hes athletic hes powerful and strong and he can pull and he can run thats a real plus when your center can be somebody that is that mobile and can be a part of any of the blocking schemes that you worry about trying to get to the second level against very fast athletic linebackers
1763645 as optimistic as we are and as good as we think hes going to be we really need some other guys to contribute to the success of this running game
1763646 one guy that i really need to say something good about is shaun draughn
1763647 he had played running back in high school and he asked for the opportunity after spring practice thinking that it might be an opportunity for him to contribute
1763648 hes got a chance to be a really significant contributor on special teams and hes done some really nice things hes got some running skills the one thing that separates all running backs is vision some kids have it and some kids dont shauns got that
1763649 burneys probably one of the most improved in the secondary
1763650 i think it was an enormous benefit to him to not go through baseball this past spring he certainly understands the schemes better he had an excellent summertime working with strength and conditioning coach jeff connors he really worked on his speed i think hes made some real strides in that area
1763651 i dont think itll be that big of a difference for me
1763652 ill still be doing the same position well just have one less playmaker on the field
1763653 it was real tough especially since it was about the third series of the first game when i first got hurt
1763654 this offense you have a little bit more freedom on your routes at the top of your routes to do different things
1763655 hes got excellent hands any time the ball is near him it seems like hes coming down with it he makes the tough catch im excited that hes on my team and im ready to see what he does in live action
1763656 now theres just a couple little nuances and things like that that i have to figure out
1763657 hes having a procedure what you call it i dont know
1763658 i knew some stuff and then some stuff i just relied on my athletic ability
1763659 last year i was just out there trying to play hopefully getting the call right first of all but this year i think it will be a lot better for me
1763660 last year we got a lot of game experience which should help us out this year we know a little bit more of the respect that we have to give at linebacker both of us played quarterback in high school so it was new to us but i think were getting a hold of it
1763661 i kind of feel like an old head and a veteran a little
1763662 schadenfreude is enjoyment taken from the misfortune of someone else

1763667 this should be a very interesting show everyone has a story behind their tattoos and there are a lot of tattooed people out there im looking forward to being a part of the first show
1763668 ive been advised by everyone not to take the first opportunity thrown at you
1763669 i want to take advantage of the next six months and weigh all my options whether its being a spokesman for a restaurant group or food company or working with a television production company or food writing theres no reason why it cant be all of these things but its a matter or choosing those things in the right order
1763670 which really helps because im inexperienced in making these kinds of decisions
1763671 but when all is said and done i felt i was portrayed in a good light one reason i agreed to do this show is because its not a catty show so you dont see a lot of language or fighting

1763752 there were years i coached in the big east with miami and it was basically get ready for one game outside of that it was pretty much a cakewalk
1763753 a lot of times wide receivers are blamed when its a bad throw or they might have not the protection we might have to throw early to the average spectator they think its all the receivers fault or something like that when it could be a lot of different things but the receivers had a good spring they all did very good we have a lot of depth so thats a very good thing they made a lot of big plays all spring
1763754 while um could lose 3 or 4 and get a bcs bowl game

1763796 baseball ist das nicht das was fr her mal brennball war hm nein das kann ich mir nicht bei den olympischen spielen vorstellen und trampolin aus dem bauch heraus w rde ich sagen nein genau wie golf das ist f r die zuschauer doch viel zu langweilig

1763858 de criminelen hebben geavanceerde sniffer programmas ge nstalleerd op de netwerken van de bedrijven hetgeen ze in staat stelde om gegevens van creditcards en wachtwoorden te verzamelen
1763859 deze zaak toont aan dat we steeds kwetsbaarder zijn voor diefstal van onze persoonlijke informatie computernetwerken en internet zijn een onmisbaar onderdeel van de wereldeconomie maar ze brengen helaas niet alleen maar voordelen op het gebied van handel en communicatie ze zorgen ook voor interessante mogelijkheden voor criminelen wanneer criminelen in staat zijn om computers te hacken en informatie te stelen kunnen ze ongelooflijk veel schade aanrichten

1763867 certainly the regular season is probably more important because theres so many more kids but this is a nice way to recognize those kids who have just excelled a little bit more than the rest of their peers on the field
1763868 they will get a chance to play against the best of their peers in the rbi program
1763869 for many kids its their first time leaving their home city many times their first time on an airplane so its just a fantastic experience that way and its important that when they reach their destination here in california that we make it really a fantastic experience
1763870 those kids who are the best of the best so to speak the scouts will see them play and perform theres going to be one or two here who are going to be drafted some day and might make the major leagues but more importantly theres going to be so many kids at this event both on the girls and boys side who are going to be major league citizens who are going to go on to college and go on to great things and be the future leaders of this country
1763871 theyre going to meet people from all different walks their peers from the different regional champions that have qualified to be here

1763874 hamburg ist mit dem heutigen tag das erste bundesland das seine fahrzeuge komplett auf blau silber umgestellt hat
1763875 ich sehe das mit einem weinenden und einem lachenden auge schlie lich bin ich in der polizei mit gr n wei gro geworden aber nun haben wir einen der modernsten fuhrparks europas
1763876 das wei ich gar nicht das macht alles mein b ro
1763877 wir haben die rechnung mit der bitte um weitergehende spezifikation und inhaltliche pr fung zur ck gereicht
1763878 sie haben vom gesetz her anspruch auf eine bliche und angemessene verg tung
1763879 ich freu mich auf olympia habe mir vorgenommen basketball zu schauen die jungs haben eine sehr schwere gruppe und brauchen unterst tzung hoffentlich bleibt alles friedlich gewalt ist fehl am platze
1763880 die spiele d rften nicht in china stattfinden w re ich ein sportler w rde ich peking boykottieren was den menschen dort angetan wird ist unfassbar und in deutschland undenkbar
1763881 wir sehen olympia mit gemischten gef hlen entgegen die politik in china ist nicht in ordnung trotzdem werden wir uns die spiele ansehen vor allem die er ffnungsfeier die wird sicher ein echtes highlight
1763882 ich freu mich auf die spiele die wenigen kampfsportarten interessieren mich besonders das liegt aber auch daran dass ich selber mal kickboxen gemacht habe viel zeit zum gucken bleibt nicht denn die arbeit ruft
1763883 ich bin ehrlich gesagt nicht so interessiert ich hab viel zu viel um die ohren wenn ich aber zeit habe werde ich mir ganz bestimmt die fu ballspiele angucken vielleicht gucke ich einfach beim kellnern nebenbei
1763884 olympia ist eine sehr gute sache es bringt leute zusammen und massen vor die bildschirme ich pers nlich werde mir gut gelaunt und mit gro er spannung die sprintwettbewerbe und die fu ballspiele im tv angucken
1763885 ich werde mir auf jeden fall die spiele ansehen ich freue mich besonders darauf sportler zu sehen die sonst nicht so im blickpunkt stehen nat rlich hoffe ich auf ein gutes abschneiden der deutschen athleten insgesamt w nsche ich allen sportlern gl ck und viel spa
1763886 mein interesse ist nur m ig ich mache den sport lieber selber anstatt ihn mir im tv anzusehen dennoch glaube ich dass ich das eine oder andere doch sehen werde ich hoffe nur dass es eine saubere veranstaltung mit fairen mitteln wird
1763887 ich glaube auf die olympischen spiele freut sich jeder mensch es ist wirklich klasse dass es solch ein festival gibt wenn ich nicht gerade arbeiten muss werde ich mir so viel wie m glich im fernsehen anschauen und mit den sportlern mitfiebern
1763888 nat rlich gucke ich mir die spiele an ich fiebere mit den deutschen und hoffe dass sie so viele medaillen wie m glich mit nach hause bringen werden was dort mit der internetzensur abgeht ist allerdings eine absolute katastrophe
1763889 die forschungslage zu schadstoffen wie diesel in fl ssen ist schlecht

1763891 dass mit der firma was nicht stimmt das merkten wir schon als wir am hamburger flughafen eincheckten
1763892 der mann am abfertigungsschalter warf einen berraschten blick auf unsere flugscheine verdrehte die augen und sagte dass er uns viel gl ck w nsche denn wir k nnten es gebrauchen
1763893 im ersten hotel in das sie uns verfrachteten wollten stank es schon in der lobby widerlich nach essen das klo war verdreckt
1763894 da hat sich unsere 20 k pfige gruppe strikt geweigert zu bleiben
1763895 auch das ein furchtbarer laden in dem sonst nur einheimische g ste absteigen es war ein kampf zum fr hst ck kaffee zu bekommen und als wir um 20 uhr zum essen gingen war das buffet schon leer und wurde auch nicht mehr aufgef llt dabei hatten wir halbpension gebucht
1763896 ob man so was unter direktflug versteht wei ich nicht
1763897 von dort wurden wir mit einem bus endlich nach hause gebracht
1763898 ich kann nicht mehr arbeiten ich sch me mich f r mein aussehen ich bin nicht mehr dieselbe frau
1763899 ich sehe aus als h tte mich ein hai angefallen
1763900 zwei mal in wenigen monaten sagten mir die rzte dass meine frau vielleicht sterbe das steckt man nicht so schnell weg
1763901 wir wollten unser h uschen von der saga kaufen hatten uns alles genau durchgerechnet
1763902 ich sagte da stimmt was nicht aber die nahmen mich tagelang nicht ernst
1763903 eine solche komplikation ist sehr bedauerlich aber durch die n he der organe nicht auszuschlie en hier ber war die patientin auch aufgekl rt worden
1763904 in den vergangenen acht jahren gab es in unserem krankenhaus 13 f lle von gasbrand also ein bis zwei pro jahr bei zirka 3500 operationen pro jahr macht das 0 05 prozent
1763905 die patientin hatte nach der operation eine schwere passagest rung des darms im rahmen dieses staus scheint es zu einer durchwanderung von keimen durch die darmwand in die wunde gekommen zu sein
1763906 wir mussten unseren traum vom eigenen haus begraben weil ich nur noch wenige stunden arbeiten kann ich bin in psychologischer behandlung denke viel an den tod unser familienleben dreht sich nur noch um krankheiten
1763907 ich bin nicht mehr die fr hliche frau die ich einmal war

1763910 the whole team is dedicated to bringing an amazing gaming experience to the pc the game looks and plays beautifully on pc and we cant wait for people to play it
1763911 that was very very very much fun unfortunately i turned it down
1763912 bear with us because i know how you hate to be the center of attention
1763913 we have la cr me de la cr me here on this wonderful wonderful deck
1763914 books mean civilization and we need books and youre all here as part of that group
1763915 i am not done i am not done by a long shot
1763916 here when you run into people at an event usually youre talking about oh did you see page six today
1763917 small talk tends to be a little more highbrow a little more intelligent
1763918 you know youre talking about the latest thing that president bush did or the latest kind of national policy issue
1763919 our balance sheet remains strong and we are extremely well positioned in the current environment
1763920 youd imagine that someone like the senator who is constantly traveling and constantly on how can he return these personal e mails
1763921 i write saying thank you scarlett for doing what you do and suddenly we have this e mail relationship
1763922 i kept thinking to myself god if this was just like kal penn or george clooney or any of the other obama surrogates or supporters there wouldnt be any question about it nobody would even talk about it
1763923 we could save all the oil that theyre talking about getting off drilling if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune ups
1763924 instead of running ads about paris hilton and britney spears they should go talk to some energy experts and actually make a difference
1763925 given the way shallow national politics works obama will lose this exchange and wind up sounding like a dukakisian know it all
1763926 obama really can turn the gops juvenile tire gauge gags to his advantage
1763927 a more pitch perfect response to the idiocy of the modern day gop
1763928 a lighter tone at times than the gop is something that represents a change from the last election
1763929 the gops mockery of john kerry had a kind of effortless quality
1763930 let obama keep talking about tires from now until november
1763931 its hardly worth mentioning much less mounting any sort of actual criticism
1763932 the themes laid out in this video wouldnt simply be my rejoinder to the gops tire gauge bullshit theyd be my message for the next few months
1763933 was quite pitch perfect maybe a touch too eggheady with the mention of experts
1763934 this resonates more than usual after eight years of george w bush
1763935 if obama adopts this as a standard refrain that ad could end up backfiring on mccain
1763936 the hits have gotten a bit under obamas skin but there are probably some obama supporters who are glad to see he had some fight in him
1763937 underscores the feeling held by many republicans that hes a tad too intellectually honest for his own good to carry out a mockery campaign against obama
1763938 were not adopting linux to the exclusion of others and will continue to support an agnostic approach which is best for customers
1763939 the basic premise behind the report that incident data in its raw form is signaling a serious health threat from these ingredients is fundamentally flawed there was no evaluation by expert clinical and medical toxicologists to sort out incidents that under further scrutiny by epas team of expert toxicologists and medical professionals would have been excluded from the raw data set to allow for a meaningful analysis
1763940 erinnert an die flaming lips und das ist bei der eigenst ndigkeit des albums nat rlich als kompliment gemeint

1763947 we were using salesforce com but our investment was challenged by the fact that we werent getting accurate information out of it that we could act upon
1763948 we needed to a way to become more efficient and effective
1763949 from our internal employee survey i could see that my department was not in alignment with the company
1763950 it gives me just the right information in just the right format
1763951 we didnt need to have a lot of meetings to discuss the information i wanted to get out of salesforce because cloud9 analytics had already thought it all through they know what people like me want to look at

1763960 the illustrations complement the carnivalesque quality of all these personalities from different eras interacting in the same environment
1763961 obatas art design has some gothic element which are perfect for castlevania series
1763962 he gave us suggestions on the kinds of details and textures needed to translate the artwork appropriately into three dimensions
1763963 so i cannot go into too much depth at this time but most of the songs are arrangement of classic themes corresponding to the origins of each character
1763964 castlevania is known for its unique 2d side scrolling action but to expand the franchise we need to keep ourselves open to new challenges
1763965 the adoption of open source technology is widespread but uneven in the defense department

1764210 what happens when the fbi spends millions of dollars targeting an american citizen for an illegal cointelpro operation while perpetrating precedent setting violations of that citizens constitutional rights yet fails to arrest that person the fbi then uses the media to slander the targeted person and coercion to blackmail those around the target including the targets family into keeping silent in regard to the torture they are being subjected to in efforts to drive them to suicide such precedent setting crimes are now being perpetrated against my person by the fbi nsa amp dhs you could be their next victim
1764211 the indigo blue ribbon campaign to promote the awareness of people targeted for mind control amp organized stalking crimes
1764212 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
1764213 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
1764214 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
1764215 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
1764216 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
1764217 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
1764218 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
1764219 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
1764220 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
1764221 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
1764222 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
1764223 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
1764224 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

1764234 what is the us federal government doing using satellites to spy on americans within the privacy of their own homes this has been occurring since long before the 9 11 attacks black operations which were an inside job perpetrated to keep the war on terror open ended so that the illuminati run us federal government can continue to erode our freedoms under the pretext of protecting us from an invisible enemy
1764235 it is illegal amp against its charter for the nsa to spy domestically unless it receives permission from the fisa court to do so and then only if it can prove that the american citizen to be placed under surveillance is in contact with an international terrorist so exactly what is the nsa doing illegally spying on myself and millions of other unwitting americans
1764236 nsa personnel can dial up any individual in the country on the signals lntelligence emf scanning network and the nsas computers will then pinpoint and track that person 24 hours a day the nsa can pick out and track anyone in the u s
1764237 the followings a diagram of the type of mind control software that agencies like the nsa utilize on targets of illegal mind control research any american citizen can be targeted for this satellite based weaponry at any time without their knowledge or consent
1764238 we need a program of psychosurgery for political control of our society the purpose is physical control of the mind everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated the individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence but this is only his personal point of view this lacks historical perspective man does not have the right to develop his own mind this kind of liberal orientation has great appeal we must electrically control the brain some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain
1764239 consider the damage done to us as a people by the us congress cia fbi dod nsa and dhs alone the biological chemical and electronic warfare that they have subjected so many of us to the illegal and humiliating nsa satellite spying of us within the privacy of our own domiciles the inhumanity of their mind control torture the complete manipulation of the us economy through the illuminati controlled federal reserve bank and irs and the treasonous crimes committed by them through the improperly ratified and unconstitutional federal reserve act the us federal governments usurpation and manipulation of the us media through the cias operation mockingbird the abject treason of the attacks on 9 11 and one can only arrive at the following conclusion only a population that is either extremely ignorant of the facts or masochistic would ever allow for a government which is such anathema to exist within their country
1764240 so to begin i want to state the most basic of all facts about brainwashing in the entire history of man no one has ever been brainwashed and realized or believed that he had been brainwashed
1764241 nothing would warrant the monitoring of individuals every minute habit 24 7 unless theyre us intelligence doing illegal inhumane testing
1764242 the most powerful weapon in the hands of the oppressor is the mind of the oppressed
1764243 the extensive crimes against humanity which the us federal government controlled by the privately held federal reserve bank has perpetrated against the american people which includes the crime of menticide are so far reaching that in most instances its beyond their comprehension the people of this planet must stop thinking in groups amp starting thinking for themselves the illuminati has us convinced that we should be fighting eachother as in making war on other countries when it is the illuminati which operates through our banking systems amp governments whom we should be working to destroy
1764244 these guys are professional liars who have raised selected memory loss to an art form
1764245 with the creation of this website ive done the best i can to document the nsas illegal spying and mind control operations which adversely affect myself and myriad other americans in the present day there are also citizens from many other countries reporting this same phenomenon
1764246 as for the 9 11 attacks with the satellite spy technology that the nsa has incorporated into its echelon spy system there is absolutely no way that this agency would not have known about the attacks on 9 11 before hand if osama bin ladin was really behind these attacks as we have been told the nsa could have immediately disabled him through the use of directed energy weapons technology bin laden like lee harvey oswald was nothing more than a lightening rod used to cover up yet another major us intelligence black operation perpetrated against the american people

1764274 they said nobody could convince her mother to get out of this relationship and unfortunately it ended in tragic results her death
1764275 while my mother rests peacefully you get to look forward to burning in hell may your days be long and miserable and may you see my mothers face as she took her last breath every time you close your eyes
1764276 if you want to give out your personal information you want to be careful about which companies you give that to hopefully the bigger companies are taking more steps to try to secure their stuff but as you see the criminals are always one step ahead no matter what steps we take and we have to react to what theyre doing
1764277 that way if someone got in there they might have a harder time getting the data
1764278 defensively the areas where we have lost some players i do feel there is some excellent potential with some of our linebackers and secondary people
1764279 schedule wise we have a challenging non conference which is as exciting as it is challenging and our guys realize that they are going have to be able to play early the big 12 schedule is what it is i dont ever think from one year to the other that it is more difficult or any easier it is challenging and we have a lot of good football teams in the league and i think there are five in the top 14 there are a lot of good football teams so it will be as challenging as it always is
1764280 there is a good amount of experience coming back if you really look at it virtually every starter is back all of those guys have started in all those positions but we got to be more consistent i think it does begin with the offensive line if they will be more consistent more physical and play at a higher level than it will give an opportunity to be physical and run the ball if we will protect the quarterback we will still throw it more efficiently and very well
1764281 guys like jermaine gresham we will find more way to find him the ball and all the other guys that are there there are only so many spans in the game and to me the hardest thing to defend is when you use the whole field and use all of your people to me you can have certain coverage to where its hard to get to one guy but the other guys need to step up and that is where we need to go
1764282 in some cases yes and in other cases no i think it is to have more sense of urgency i think that the pace of play with the 40 second clock is going to pick up for everybody
1764283 i think more than anything trying not to press him and act like he needs to do anything differently
1764284 he is stronger in the weight room and in the years of maturity he is a stronger guy i know he will be more comfortable in the position going through 14 games a year ago i think just play within the system take what is there and be smart and i think naturally just some pocket presence i think that the hardest think to teach young guys is to stay in the pocket trust it and throw it he really has that and always has i think there are some times he can escape it maybe a little bit better but it may come naturally to him i fact i just saw it just yesterday a time or too when he got pressured he just stepped away from it he is a really good athlete the way he moves and runs and the strength that he has he is a really good athlete
1764285 i would say that it is obviously the part where we have lost the most players but i have been very comfortable and pleased with a great number of practices in the spring and what i have seen in two days here that we have great ability here and play the way that we are used to playing
1764286 those guys up front really have a great chance to be a great unit and play well but they still need to be backed up and they still need to be in position because those guys can only control so much
1764287 we were still first or second in the league in every defensive category so we played pretty decent i think that the tempo and the pace of play i think for all defenses you have got to operate the same way
1764288 austin has a great motor great toughness to him and it is recognized by the team our players love watching him play
1764289 demarco murray has a chance to be a really special player and he is just such a good athlete it is fun to watch him he has got great hands and i have said it before he could be an all american at corner receiver or running back he just has that ability to do about anything he wants and he could have no problem to play college basketball if he wants it is just amazing his upside and what is potential is really is quite vast
1764290 competition is the coachs greatest ally a few years ago everyone threw the offensive line under the bus and they had something to prove now with these guys as seniors if they lose that urgency and get complacent they will be average players
1764291 i dont know if it will be significantly different as far as using the talents of our team the schemes might remain similar because thats the strength of the team you can only do what your line can do and you can only do what your quarterback can handle
1764292 you have to practice in a way your team can get better we are just trying to manage it as we go and as a staff we will decide if it accelerates or pulls back
1764293 i think as a coach i need to be on top of it most of the delays of games come from the indecisiveness of the coaching staff and at the last second youre out of time
1764294 i dont know if it will be that significant weve been practicing with the clock and getting our kids used to getting back and getting the play the key to getting more snaps is not turning the ball over and converting on third downs
1764295 demarco murray and chris brown both ran the conditioning test and ran every snap i think mossis madu has looked as good as both of those guys we potentially have six guys carrying the ball i think at receiver a lot of young guys showed a physical competitiveness and they are learning how to play in the spring we didnt have a lot of skilled bodies and i felt like after awhile we got tired yesterday we had a lot of speed and you could feel it it was definitely a good thing
1764296 its been really positive for sam bradford and its also been positive for joey halzle joey has really settled in and i think hes a much better player on second team than he was battling it out for number one last year more than anything when we break it down and were getting ready for a competitive third down drill sam is one of the more vocal leaders of our team the key thing as a quality player is to have the confidence to be a leader but also to play within him and not push the limit the key to a young player who played so well is to stay mature and grounded and not cross the line a sophomore slump happens when he doesnt have a supporting cast if hes arrogant and thinks hes better than he is or when he tries to make plays he cant make sam has the makeup to avoid the pitfalls but well see
1764297 last year the ball got spread around and we have ample players and you think thats going to happen at the same time we have some playmakers that can make plays and you want them to get touches the quarterback is going to take whats there based on the reads i think the ball can go a lot of places because our system allows it our quarterback has the ability to go to different guys and there are ample guys that can get the ball i think we are going to be a reasonably good passing team
1764298 brody eldridge is the best offensive player on our team nothing against sam and all the talent on our team but brody is a tremendous football player i told jermaine gresham he didnt have to listen to me but to watch brody and that has helped jermaine into becoming a fantastic blocker its exciting and intriguing to think of what these players can do for us
1764299 it doesnt take much with the internet and video phones to get some shots its unfortunate that we have phenomenal fans and we want to treat the fans well but in these days with communication i dont know what we gain by having our practices open theres not really anything to hide but it doesnt help us with our opponents it doesnt help our kids at all
1764300 we have a chance to be really good if our old guys can buy in and be great team players we have some skilled kids who can make plays last year we scored a lot of points with only two seniors on our team now we have five linemen three wide receivers and a returning starting quarterback the expectation is that this offense should be as good or better the concern is if they will buy what were selling its harder with a team that has had success the expectations are high and the challenge and concern is having good players that invest and have a common goal
1764301 theres not a great offensive player that doesnt want the ball there are a lot of egos and our challenge is to keep our guys grounded and to keep them happy i have a lot of respect for our guys and i think they feel that we have a two way street as far as coaches and players and i think that helps to keep them happy
1764302 this is one of the best summers we have had since i have been here we did a lot more team oriented stuff we were running some plays and getting things going as far as a team standpoint this is the most we have done together since i have been here and i think it showed in these first two days of practice in the cohesiveness that we have had and how close we all are now
1764303 i did have to force a little i am not a real loud guy so stepping up and saying things that last year i would not have said that is something that i made myself do this summer for the most part it was a pretty normal summer in getting prepared for two a days and the season
1764304 you cannot look at numbers numbers can be very misleading there are a lot of things i can do to be a better quarterback and there are a lot of things i can do to help our team win i did not so much look at the numbers but the bigger things i can do to help this team win i need to become more of a leader on this team like coach kevin wilson was saying maybe when we are a little off and not playing as well as we would like to be playing i step up say something and get us going find a way to get points on the board and find a way to win
1764305 last year winning the big 12 championship was a great thing for our team and to accomplish that my first year as a quarterback was something i was really proud of myself for doing but obviously the way we ended the year was not how we wanted to finish we did not play the way we were capable of playing and to wait six or seven months after that performance is really frustrating
1764306 coach wilson talks about it all the time and that is playing on edge i think doing that is probably going to be a challenge this year i have a year of experience and i am going to think i should be able to make more plays and i might try to force things but i need to realize that i am still playing football it is still the same thing i have to take care of the football and i cannot make mistakes i have to put points on the board i think just staying focused 100 percent all the time is something i need to do
1764307 last year i definitely was not afraid at all to take check downs i did not force things if they were there i took them but if not i came right down to the running back and that is something i need to do this year
1764308 i think i have gained about 10 to 12 pounds since last year i am stronger my feet have got quicker by doing a lot of footwork drills this summer i think i had a great off season and i am going to put it to use this season

1764324 the reason defrancisco didnt run for re election as head of our union was because he knew he had no shot at winning
1764325 the most recent labor contract he negotiated with boeing on behalf of the union was terrible it really hurt our membership as his chairman during the 2002 negotiations with boeing i can tell you he was a joke he was so bad i was the one who ended up doing the negotiating

1764406 its absolutely true that u s drivers are shortchanged by so called hot fuel costs to the tune of over 3 billion per year at todays prices
1764407 in southern states in the summer gasoline is sold at average temperatures exceeding 80 degrees
1764408 it wont help to buy gas early in the morning however thats because fuel tanks act like thermos bottles retaining heat
1764409 drivers today know that every drop of fuel counts and they should not have to tolerate getting less than they pay for

1764498 a determined political will is required to combat corruption and the situation in the states is alarming the criminal political bureaucrat nexus is worrying and the criminal justice system is crumbling under its own weight
1764499 the rich and powerful are able to frustrate the trial process at will by filing frivolous petitions and getting the trials stayed for years on end crucial witnesses are won over or suffer genuine memory loss owing to delays as a result the corrupt and the criminals escape scot free and fear of the law diminishes the criminal justice system needs to be reformed and strengthened greatly the state anti corruption and vigilance organizations are in urgent need of empowerment
1764500 widespread corruption in the public distribution system pds causing starvation deaths
1764501 unlike more developed economies in india corruption is more pervasive in the case of delivery of public services
1764502 this is a fact which affects the poorer sections the most and is more intractable to address in terms of effective anticorruption measures
1764503 institutional corruption is another aspect of corruption in india corruption stems from complex rules and procedures and from delays the opening up of the economy and large all around investments allow greater opportunity for graft and bribery there is a general impression that in the wake of the promulgation of the right to information act the liberalization of the economy and the use of technology there has been some improvement in the perception of corruption in india but i cannot say there has been a significant improvement as far as the average citizen is concerned
1764504 the country may be headed in the right direction in its fight against corruption but the political will is largely lacking
1764505 this is the reason why we felt the target for our forthcoming corruption study should be the rural masses living below poverty levels they continue to be affected by corruption in their day to day existence

1764510 i dont think the rest of the church really understands the gravity of the situation in ft worth or the other acn dioceses will we the leadership of tec and especially the bishops continue to watch as this sort of emotional and spiritual violence continues first guns from the stand firm folks now guns and tasers in the diocese of ft worth and theres not even an effort to hide this violent activity
1764511 wherever christians gather to take a stand for the gospel even in church conventions the devil will be close at hand seeking to beguile divide and mislead watch out
1764512 counterfeit christianity man made religion and revisionist theology must be identified and rebuked for the sake of the unchanging gospel of our lord jesus christ
1764513 let us not lose our will to stand for conscience and truth whatever the consequences or the cost
1764514 how do you fancy yourself as one of the chosen recipients of
1764515 what a wonderful way for a minister to have a baby
1764516 the challenge of diversity the witness of paul and the gospels
1764517 if all that we have is an eye for an eye eventually the whole world will be blind
1764518 the peace of god which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge and love of god
1764519 i will go through the creed phrase by phrase your task and mine will be to stand when the phrase is something you believe and that makes a difference in your life the second part of the task is that we will sit down when the phrase is something we dont believe or understand or it doesnt make a difference in our lives got it i will repeat it one more time
1764520 were there any phrases for which no one was standing
1764521 so there was someone standing at all times were they always the same people
1764522 did you feel under any pressure to stand for a phrase you dont understand or believe
1764523 did you notice if anyone was sitting all the way through
1764524 did you notice if anyone was standing all the way through
1764525 would it does it bother you that we werent standing all the way through
1764526 well i dont think he has flip flopped at all joe you dont have to listen to the politicians about this you can listen to people like boone pickens who has made billions of dollars in the oil industry he has said very clearly we cant drill our way out of this problem you can listen to charlies fellow governor arnold schwarzenegger a pretty straight shooting guy who says that anybody who says we can drill our way out of this problem is not being straight with the american people
1764527 what is barack obamas position on offshore oil drilling because a lot of people are confused
1764528 he believes it is not really the short term or long term answer to the problem
1764529 we ca and fl each have a governor that is nice and tanned each has a governor that can rip off his clothes and look great in a swimsuit on the beach and each of us has a governor who can run as vice president
1764530 you know maybe theyre right maybe we can fix it given enough time and a big enough research budget
1764531 javascript testing sucks so we want to make it easier
1764532 you can choose any location you like its good to put all of your projects in one location so development cocoanotepad might be a good choice
1764533 i am very much in favour of making the web more accessible to everyone but
1764534 server side programmers who hide on the server and deny that the client side matters client side programmers so obsessed with the latest cool thing that theyre quite happy to leave groups of people behind in the name of whats cutting edge and sexy
1764535 and the men and women well the men who went to the moon they did it with no mouse and a black and white text only screen and 32 kilobytes of ram

1764537 saya yang baru menjadi menteri saja sudah sangat sibuk dengan agenda jadi saya tidak bisa membayangkan jika usia presiden di atas 60 tahun

1764608 i feel littering is a crime but i feel that humanitarian aid is never a crime i dont want to equate no more deaths humanitarian aid work with littering i think that is false and unfair and would set a really bad precedent
1764609 we welcome the decision of the court and are hopeful that magistrate velasco will stand up for justice and the value of human life

1764618 here in atlantic canada we seek gateways to global success not barriers to growth
1764619 the liberal caucus should also recognize that atlantic canadians do not need a carbon tax to lead canada on emissions reductions
1764620 we do not need stephane dion punishing us with a carbon tax that will return pennies to our pockets at tax time yet take dollars out of our wallets year round

1764639 were looking at fundamental science fundamental mathematics that in many ways are a mess of jumbled data
1764640 we try to give them a structure because as humans we make these inferences so much better when our data has structure
1764641 its an opportunity in fact an obligation at this point for everybody involved in this scenario to take a careful look at the security systems in place
1764642 created to acquaint you with the dark side of internet
1764643 the sheer number of retailers attacked by these cyber criminals demonstrates the much broader challenges in protecting sensitive consumer data from this increasing threat
1764644 this is as much a story about the lax security practices of the major retailers as it is the triumph of justice
1764645 what deplorable security practices what a bunch of leaky boats
1764646 they were watching data basically passing in the clear and they were able to access it they were basically eavesdropping on a conversation between a device and its intended server
1764647 they have tended to try to protect the data like a fortress or a castle the problem with that is the drawbridges are let down
1764648 youve got to protect the data itself data is currency on the internet now

1764653 my job is to comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable
1764654 i am most concerned by the execution of mexican national jos medellin yesterday in texas mr medellin was not informed of his right to consular help at the time of his arrest even though the united states are legally bound to guarantee this right under the 1963 vienna convention on consular relations this is a regrettable attitude by a country which is very vocal about its commitment to the rule of law the judicial authorities also blatantly ignored the order by the international court of justice to stay the execution on the grounds of the violation of the right to consular assistance i wrote to the texas board of pardons and paroles in july asking for a stay of the execution but my appeal has been disregarded in the same way as the calls from the mexican government the un secretary general and several other governments and international organisations the issue at stake is not the guilt of mr medellin he was found guilty of a particularly gruesome crime and he deserved to be punished the problem is the death penalty which is rejected by a great majority of democratic and civilised countries across the world and also the pick and choose attitude of the united states of america and its individual states when it comes to respecting international law the execution of mr medellin was therefore not only a violation of human rights and human dignity but also an act of arrogant defiance which undermines the collective mechanisms for peace and security in the world
1764655 has not hesitated to hear from the united states before one of its laws is set aside and should not do so now
1764656 rehearing is warranted to ensure that a material omission in the decisionmaking process has not tainted the courts decision on a matter of such profound constitutional moral and practical importance
1764657 even if we were persuaded that congressional acquiescence could support the president s asserted authority such acquiescence does not exist here
1764658 beyond the bare introduction of a bill in the four years since the world court ruling and the four months since our ruling in medellin v texas
1764659 the department of justice of the united states is well aware of these proceedings and has not chosen to seek our intervention it silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that medellin was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access

1764688 im a huge comic book fan and ive wanted to do some comic book work for a while now and what better way to get my start than with a wrestling comic so when headlocked writer creator mike kingston asked me if i would be interested in doing a cover i jumped at the chance
1764689 the mans been on television in movies and hes a household name to three generations of wrestling fans so were obviously very pleased to be publishing jerry lawlers first comic book work
1764690 ive always been a huge lawler fan i used to trade for tapes of memphis wrestling back before you could find everything on the internet getting to work with him and actually getting to watch him physically paint the cover has easily been my career highlight thus far
1764691 its a story about all the crazy stuff that goes into what you see on television when a guy shows up on a wwe show he most likely already has four to seven years in the wrestling business but you rarely hear anything about that headlocked is the chronicle of that journey for mike hartmann
1764692 he approaches wrestling the same way he did acting he bulks up just like an actor preparing for an action movie and he moves to philadelphia which is essentially hollywood for aspiring wrestlers because of his background were able to put a little more focus on the craft of professional wrestling and examine its place as a true performance art
1764693 there are a lot of coming of age themes in headlocked the story is just as much about hartmann becoming a man as it is about him becoming a wrestler hes a nineteen year old college kid who has given up his relatively safe existence to chase this crazy dream and at the same time hes almost totally reinventing who he is from the ground up hes pretty much out there on his own in a new city trying to forge this new identity for himself while navigating through the darker underbelly of the wrestling business as a total outsider
1764694 hartmann has just moved to philadelphia having secured a tryout with the legendary leo

1764696 were worse off than we were four years ago is a line that will remind voters of what ronald reagan said of then president carters administration in 1980
1764697 the key difference between then and now is that reagan a republican was criticizing democrat carter in broken republican mccain is distancing himself from the tenure of a fellow republican president bush
1764698 mr mccain has criticized the bush administration over its handling of the iraq war its lackluster efforts to combat climate change and the absence of a comprehensive energy strategy
1764699 but in the ad mr mccain casts a far wider net and in effect condemns mr bushs second term as a failure
1764700 democrats are increasingly worried barack obama is not hitting back hard enough against rival john mccain and missing opportunities to tie the republican candidate to the bush administration
1764701 mccain seemed to find his voice with the launch of two campaign ads which received mixed reviews but helped him break through the media clutter and target the illinois senator on the issue of offshore drilling
1764702 its difficult to get a firm hand around this stuff but my intuition based on observation is that weve hit the peak of tcfs problems
1764703 and things will get better going forward in general in the third and fourth quarter and into 2009
1764704 i dont think bill can come in and wave a magic wand
1764705 lynn nagorske was under a lot of pressure and he was worn down bill will bring a new level of energy but there isnt going to be any big change in strategy and direction
1764706 they used to be able to take back houses and not lose money now theyre competing against all the houses on the market because of the subprime lenders and bad competitors and there is nostalgia inside and outside of tcf for the good old days but their model is no longer anywhere near unique and its not as profitable

1764709 to retire with an inflation adjusted retirement income of 50 000 for 20 years would require 3 075 744 65 in savings by the time you retired at 65 you need to save an additional 47 613 58 each year to reach your retirement goal
1764710 to the extent that weve got issues in our economy its like a storm or a squall line
1764711 but were focused on real long term market factors we think this personal jet will expand the market it will be the slowest lowest jet it will be an airplane that small to medium sized businesses can afford if everything works out we think we will have a base price of around 1 million and by business aviation standards it will be really cheap to fly
1764712 the jet serves as a smarter simpler and more efficient way to use transportation dollars
1764713 it will improve management productivity its going to be used for flights such as duluth to omaha or minneapolis to suburban chicago
1764714 but overall everything about the stock market is negative lately
1764715 i sat with my student managers last week and were sitting on cash they dont want to invest all the news is bad they say
1764716 the reality is there are certain companies that are down that are good this country this economy is not going to roll over and die we are an innovative people with innovative companies everybody is downtrodden im not sure weve seen the worst but were close
1764717 we believe were in a recession that really started last november things look awful now but stocks should bottom out pretty soon
1764718 stocks will recover sharply and you could see a run of 10 percent by the end of this year that carries through into 2009
1764719 there is still some expectation in some quarters that the economy is not as bad as we think it is we see a couple pretty good quarters coming and then a recession in 2009
1764720 well just have a good ol fashioned battle for it
1764721 lets make the spidey of the comic match the spidey of the movies
1764722 i think im about to be ejected from the stadium theres no reason why you should stick around and get in trouble with me go hurry ill call you in a little bit dont worry well work it out
1764723 you mean theres a chance that millar wants it for himself
1764724 he catches lots of balls hes the king of the foul ball
1764725 youll be lucky to make it out of here alive
1764726 did i just see that did the ball bounce of the padding or did you make the flip
1764727 no thats right he just glove flipped it to me and he just saved that little kids life right before that
1764728 if chase doesnt show up today you and i can work up the middle together
1764729 im sitting in section 135 please let me know if ill be needed but if something goes up the middle im flipping to you there is no way i can make the throw

1764733 piper is our largest brightest light in clean tech investment banking this can only be good for minnesota and our energy opportunities

1764736 zu unserem erfolg in diesem quartal haben in erster linie eine st rkere nachfrage in asien und nordamerika sowie h here ums tze in der automobil halbleiter elektronik und photovoltaik industrie beigetragen

1764739 ich w rde bis ende des jahres keinen zukauf erwarten
1764740 so 485 was the price and we hit the bid and i think when you look back five years from now or ten years from now whether it was 485 or 450 it will have been a good deal for the company we think the deal will close in the third quarter and we are happy with it
1764741 we also bought back some shares at 500 average last year 291 00 we still have 700 000 shares as a buyback program its not a program it is an allowance from the board we still have excess capital but we are entering cat catastrophe season so we have to be a little bit more careful about being too thin during the cat season but as our businesses shrinks in the soft market as we produce i believe good underwriting results good investment results we will generate more undeployed capital as we go forward here so at this price i can tell you we are buyers of our shares

1764747 you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and not a maverick when it doesnt work for you when you received your partys nomination
1764748 if senator mccain wants to talk about how washington is broken thats a debate im happy to have because senator mccains energy plan reads like an early christmas list for oil and gas lobbyists its no wonder because many of his top advisers are former oil and gas lobbyists
1764749 its time to retire these old policies and bring new energy to america
1764750 we look forward to the success the partnership between jowood distribution and tgc is certain to result in

1764805 the s amp p 500 is down 23 percent historically it takes a year to come out of a bear market i wouldnt be surprised to see a tug of war in the market for the rest of the year
1764806 right now it pays to have more cash than less in the portfolio and were more defensive in nature we dont like the financials or consumer stocks right now but we know that somewhere down the line were going to have to get back into financials because when those companies pop theyre going up 20 or 30 percent

1764809 sometimes in order to snag a baseball you have to sacrifice your body like what i just did i slid on my knee and that is how i got my very first foul ball of the day
1764810 the green cup on the little stool next to the doorway under there
1764811 sometimes you have to sacrifice your body for a ball
1764812 i dont see how he can guarantee youll get a ball
1764813 no he can he gets a ball every game he got like 31 balls in a game once
1764814 three minutes ago the guy at the next window told me i could get one for forty eight
1764815 look all game long we gotta deal with people trying to move up from there regular seat then they get mad at us when we tell them to go back to their own seat it happens all game long it is tiring and frustrating

1764829 a source at warner bros has since confirmed this saying they are developing it as a major movie but wont share anything other than that nothing we didnt already know though
1764830 dump all your old ideas about whats happening in northern ireland
1764831 asking the right questions and getting together the right answers
1764832 i have asked that they produce an ad hoc report clarifying its assessment of the completion of the transformation of pira as set out in its 18th report
1764833 the notion that there has been a steady increase in favour of women taking an equal role in the workplace and away from their traditional role in the home is clearly a myth
1764834 creationism is not for the re class because i believe that it can stand scientific scrutiny and that is a debate which i am quite happy to encourage and be part of the issue for the current education minister caitriona ruane is that she tells us shes all for equality surely if that is the case you cant have one set of interpretations being taught at the expense of others
1764835 the use of the word theory can mislead those not familiar with science
1764836 this is due to an increased disillusionment with current sinn fein strategy i no longer share the belief that this strategy will lead to irish unification it is not just solely about policing i am disillusioned with the current political strategy
1764837 i think this is half baked i dont think were ready for it i dont think the people want it
1764838 i dont know whos going to do it be justice minister because weve not been involved in any discussions on it it appears the alliance havent been properly involved in discussions on it i dont believe the sdlp has
1764839 so how you can announce an agreement without other parties being involved in it escapes me
1764840 a blind one legged monkey could now orchestrate these regular farragoes
1764841 we took these risks and decisions in the name of peace and progress
1764842 northern ireland is crying out for bright young politicians with new ideas and fresh thinking yet how would they ever get a foot on the political ladder when every run of that ladder is occupied by greedy politicians with dual and even triple mandates
1764843 they the dup and sinn fein really ought to consult with us before they spin about us
1764844 i think there is this idea that they can rely on us to ride to the rescue well they can t expect that when they haven t spoken to us on the issue for the last 16 months
1764845 we have been given the job to provide an effective opposition by the electorate and the fact is this is an incoherent and incompetent executive and my party will play no part in that
1764846 the reality is the executive in place has failed to tackle a range of problems from education to rural planning to the irish language and the proposed maze stadium
1764847 and the thought that they need us to take on a department they can t deal with on top of all the others they ve been unable to deal with properly is just bonkers
1764848 he loyally and steadfastly preaches the gospel but he doesnt shove it down our throats we get on well with david
1764849 further expand ibms commitment to linux and open source by enabling the next generation of linux
1764850 we see the next real growth in the linux market coming from five main directions
1764851 these include big green linux linux for business critical operations linux desktop mid market solutions and emerging technologies on linux
1764852 ready to use fully integration solution that can be delivered on dvds or usb drives
1764853 ibm has been investing in enterprise linux from the beginning
1764854 and we have this humongous portfolio of software available to support it but as we have watched linux mature we ve seen a couple of areas that are on the brink of opening up opportunities for us for customers for partners and for the industry
1764855 we ve long believed that one of the best ways to deliver technology to this market is through what is popularly known as an appliance
1764856 opens new opportunities for domino software vendors to deliver their applications on a software appliance to the smallest businesses
1764857 until now there really hasn t been a good integrated enterprise ready choice for small business besides this microsoft offering
1764858 we believe it will present a compelling alternative and bring openness to the world of small business which hasn t been historically true

1764895 there is a significant possibility that braid would have been the next psychonauts or beyond good and evil critically acclaimed but nobody played it even at usd 10 if that happens at usd 10 then i am in debt and have to get a job and cant make games any more if that happens at usd 15 maybe i can still make games that is the difference
1764896 and again i dont know if i would have been able to convince microsoft to release the game at 800 points anyway so it seemed my best move was to make the agreement and keep a good relationship with them
1764897 attacks on the chief justice the constitutional court other members of the judiciary and institutions of justice undermine the legitimacy of the judiciary the courts and our democracy
1764898 as the chief justice has warned uninformed reactionary and alarmist criticism has the potential to weaken confidence in the judiciary and without public confidence the judicial system cannot operate effectively

1764900 we got to know about rti through a friend he helped us to get the papers done with the help of a lawyer
1764901 why this case is notable is because this person concerned is a resident of a slum he is illiterate yet he had heard of the rti and then sought to use it not only that as a result of the rti he was able to get a hearing with a number of senior police officers
1764902 this is the most exciting day ever in my life
1764903 its a great honor for me that my teammates chose to vote for me the opening ceremony is the best day and the best moment of olympic life im here as an ambassador of my country and i will do everything i can to represent my country well
1764904 the american flag means everything in my life everything that describes me coming from another country and going through all of the stages that i have to become a u s citizen
1764905 this is another amazing step for me in celebrating being an american seeing my fellow americans coming behind me in the opening ceremony and supporting me will be a great honor the highest honor its just a happy day i dont even have the words to describe how happy i am
1764906 usa track amp field congratulates lopez in being selected for this incredible honor

1764917 i liked the fact that there were no frou frous
1764918 why i used to eat a lobster like that at one sitting
1764919 as a practical john maszka i think youre absolutely correct
1764920 it is even unclear whether mr obama has yet whittled his choice down to a shortlist but a straw poll of obama staff members and democrats close to the campaign suggests that five or six names recur each is deemed capable of helping to neutralise one or more of mr obamas perceived weaknesses inexperience lack of national security credentials the perception that he is aloof and his poor record of winning over blue collar voters in swing states of the rust belt all are evaluated principally on their ability to help mr obama win in november as opposed to the contributions they might make to an administration in addition good personal chemistry is essential mr bayh is one of the most credible
1764921 i guess the best way to put it is if theres an announcement id be as surprised as anybody else
1764922 there are very few breakthrough innovations in the market today addressing these industry wide thermal issues
1764923 nextreme is managed by an accomplished start up team and offers a highly differentiated technology backed by a very strong intellectual property position
1764924 we are very pleased with where we are now positioned
1764925 we are seeing strong interest in the optocooler upf4 and upf40 products and anticipate design wins in the telecom industry this year with financing in place and production up and running we can concentrate fully on making that happen
1764926 customer adoption is always a risk for a new product
1764927 enabling it to be incorporated into existing designs with as little change as possible is a good strategy for getting through the customers front door and inspiring further redesigns later on companies that have bumped up against performance limitations due to thermal management issues should engage with nextreme to find a possible way to sidestep these issues
1764928 the tegam 3525 and 3550 lcr meter offer the best cost performance value on the market
1764929 the tegam 2720a and 2730a deliver the best of both worlds function generator architecture and the precision of a true arbitrary waveform generator tegam has developed several products that we can now provide to customers with component testing and waveform generation test applications

1764931 i started praying about whether or not the lord wanted me to run
1764932 and the more i prayed the more i felt he did
1764933 run lose and just be a much better government teacher
1764934 and so here i am and im not the typical legislator the lord showed me right off the bat that im not supposed to be as a matter of fact my lord made it very clear to me that i am a cultural warrior and you know i tried to say no to that too cause thats pretty hard but anyway thats where i am
1764935 government cannot force people to change and yet we see thats what government is doing
1764936 every time government passes another law they are taking away some of our freedoms
1764937 youre always going to be worried that in that first meeting theyre going to be like ok its kate hudson and matthew mcconaughey on a desert island hunting for pirate treasure but its not going to go that way
1764938 my expectation at this time from everything that ive heard is that it will very much honour the dramatic and thematic elements of the game they certainly understand the material and are able to provide a stamp of their own
1764939 they take two did a really good deal not in terms of the financials but in terms of the people he chose to work with and how its going to impact on the franchise there are a lot of smart people involved
1764940 i had reached a juncture at this point in the run either i could get discouraged with the reality that i am not able to think myself into sprinting up the hill or i could accept and even relish in the pain and discomfort running throughout my body embracing the pain as part of my mission then something happened that i have never experienced during any painful running session a smile slowly crept across my face it was kind of a weird reaction to have but for some reason i felt very alive and there was a new joy that i found in simply going all out it was a great feeling to know that i was pushing myself to the max that at this moment i had looked deep into myself for strength and used whatever i could muster
1764941 i am going to win that gold medal silver is crap bronze is crap god if i only got a bronze i could never go home to oregon again i am going to win that gold medal
1764942 we have cancelled the invitations because we dont have essential commodities like mutton and chicken because of the highway blockade

1764947 my kids are big fans of youtube usually the cats on skateboard kind of clips
1764948 i came to realize that its not just a great medium for skateboarding cats starting an online conversation was an excellent way to reach out to a huge audience largely youth that i dont normally connect with
1764949 youtube is primarily an entertainment network so i did wonder if people would engage in a serious discussion
1764950 it was a leap into the unknown for me but to be honest everything has exceeded my expectations the good and the bad theres more misunderstanding than i had appreciated more anger more bias but also more interest more support and more engagement
1764951 my favorite response is still one of the earliest ones i received are you michael jordans wife my husband found that one very funny
1764952 we have found in our polling that there is a new generation of global citizens developing people because of the internet because of opportunities for travel who have a global sensibility and greater appreciation for other people and other cultures
1764953 whats important here is that theres a direct correlation between those with global sensibilities and those who are networked via facebook and youtube and so on
1764954 these network facilities really enhance those kinds of global mentalities
1764955 theyre a nontraditional generation and we need nontraditional means to reach out and engage them their creativity energy and optimism can foster greater understanding and closer ties between people of different cultures and move us past these present hurdles
1764956 each particular variable is simple and obvious but it turns out that they interact in complicated ways
1764957 i think queen ranias youtube page is one of the more impressive attempts to use youtube for social change
1764958 its going to take some time before its meaningfully affecting global stereotypes but its a terrific start

1765003 you know my school days friend would visit me in my home and he would pick from my wardrobe any item of haute culture that he fancied and just fly home with it

1765011 a few months before he died last year frank havenner sat up in his bed in a nursing home in san francisco and told me of how the pacific gas amp electric co swindled san francisco out of hundreds of millions of dollars of cheap hydroelectric power
1765012 the story was incredible pg amp e and its political allies had defeated eight successive bond issues to establish a municipal electric system in san francisco and grant city residents and businesses the benefit of low cost power produced by the citys hetch hetchy water system in the sierra
1765013 the result san francisco has paid through the nose to pg amp e for its power and the city loses about 30 million a year in profits it would get from a public system
1765014 the disgraceful history of the handling of hetch hetchy power should place a new verb in the lexicon of political chicanery to hetch hetchy means to confuse and confound the public by adroit acts and deceptive words in order to turn to private corporate profit a trust set up for the people
1765015 i need not repeat the scandalous story thas has given birth to this new verb but i would remind you that the last chapter of it has not been written the pledge that the people of san francisco with full knowledge made to their government has not yet been redeemed
1765016 it is a wrongful and shameful policy for a grant of water and power privilege in the yosemite national park area to be developed at the expenditure of 50 million by the taxpayers of san francisco only to have its greatest financial and economic asset the hydroelectric power diverted to private corporation hands at the instant of completion to the great benefit of said corporation and at an annual deficit to the city of san francisco
1765017 passage of legislation that effectively ended the major regulatory restraints applied to the financial industry in response to the great depression
1765018 why in the world would you designate as your key economic adviser someone who left the senate to become an officer of the ubs bank that is at the very center of this mess a former senator who not only secured highly paid employment with a banking giant that benefited from legislation he helped pass but who then lobbied congress for even more of the deregulatory breaks that got the bank into such deep trouble
1765019 jimmy carter predicted 30 years ago that by 2000 we could be down from 40 per cent dependence on foreign oil to 20 per cent dependence we didnt listen instead we were up to 60 per cent by 2000 and now were pushing 70 per cent this measure will take our fate out of pg amp es hands and put it into the hands of our communities who have a profound stake in providing clean sustainable reliable and reasononably priced electric services
1765020 this initiative is about protecting the environment and the rights of san franciscans and their ratepayers its 167 miles from san francisco to hetch hetchy valley the first 140 miles of movement is cheaper than the last 27 miles because pg amp e controls it theres an economic piece and an environmental piece we have the technology geothermal and solar trough how are you going to move that power we arent going to be able to make it financially because pg amp e jacks up the rates on the last 27 miles in 20l5 theyre jacking them up again this is taking back what is ours
1765021 meaured way to make the city l00 per cent green and clean in 20 years this act mandates a feasibility study on how we can provide green and clean energy otherwise pg amp e has a monopoly here until the planet dies
1765022 its a very profound thought this is a time when people and san francisco can change the destiny of the planet as goes san francisco so goes california as goes california so goes the nation
1765023 this issue has a sordid history 500 missing ballots in the first election where did they go it involves environmental justice some have called the green movement the queenhouse effect
1765024 this is our time were going to win well keep the lights on for years
1765025 as were leaving office a lot of us want this to be our crown jewel government works government works well because government is better able to assume risk there is still a lot of risk in renewwable energy investments and so on the private industry is not going to take that risk its always going to take the cheap way out which is fossil fuels
1765026 al gore said the future of civilization is at stake gores challenge is a moral one one that weve embraced in san francisco
1765027 renewable energy and the green movement will change the worlds economy not in japan china or germany it will be here

1765070 die verfehlung der nutzer von tauschb rsen ist einfach zu gering um den ganzen rechtsstaat draufzuwerfen
1765071 die gvu konzentriert sich in ihrem rechtlichen vorgehen vor allem auf die t ter an der spitze der illegalen verbreitungspyramide die ausgangspunkte f r die massenhaften downloads
1765072 aber auch und gerade in kenntnis der angespannten personallage der strafverfolgungsbeh rden d rfen rechteinhaber nicht schutzlos gestellt werden
1765073 das problem der illegalen praxis des filesharings im internet entgegenzutreten ergibt sich aus der unendlichen masse an tauschb rsennutzern
1765074 wir pl dieren stattdessen f r eine erg nzung des bestehenden instrumentariums durch einen abgestuften sanktionsmechanismus unter einbeziehung der internetprovider
1765075 dieser ansatz der abschreckung wird nicht bei allen tauschb rsennutzern funktionieren kriminelle wird man mit diesem verfahren sicher nicht erreichen
1765076 we do not want to find ourselves chasing freehold properties in what is a falling market especially when you consider rental yields are down by double digit figures
1765077 basically we recce the property situation and instruct our agents which sites to push for
1765078 unlike a lot of other companies we are still actively acquiring properties but despite the slowdown a lot of vendors will still try to hold out for as high a price as they can
1765079 its really an attempt to establish some reality in a market where prices are generally falling
1765080 the jdw move is a reflection of its power as a reliable buyer of licensed property in a market that is certainly slowing quickly
1765081 it may also reflect the companys concern that costs pressures mean that it needs to pay less to acquire property to get the same return on its investment
1765082 in other words if pubs are becoming less profitable because they are costly to operate this needs to be reflected in asking prices
1765083 this doesnt surprise me its just another thing on top of the thousands we have to cope with
1765084 may be encouraged to take unnecessary pre emptive action and fell trees to avoid inspection costs and liabilities
1765085 the primary responsibility does lie with the djs but the venue owners should be aware of the potential implications
1765086 hopefully this will stop many illegal operators continuing to trade with illegally formatted and downloaded music
1765087 pub operators assume we have a ready bank of people with the right qualifications but nothing could be further from the truth
1765088 they think we have all the answers but extra demand as more pubs become empty has made it difficult for us to find relief people with the right skills
1765089 when licensees throw in the keys pub companies do not always try and keep them open with temporary management
1765090 it probably explains why we are not getting as much new business as we had hoped
1765091 you will find operators are now looking to sell more pubs for alternative use than they did before
1765092 plainly the new smoke free policy for the university will not ensure that everyone at ualr makes healthy choices

1765100 the business of capturing and capitalizing on technologies from u s research universities has become a massive industry with states spending billions of dollars on accelerating these efforts
1765101 the fact that the u of u has produced some of the highest metrics in the country is a great credit to the team at the tco and their ability to engage both the business and financial communities throughout the state
1765102 this illustrates in yet another way the economic value of the university of utah to this great state
1765103 our researchers understand the value of commercialization and the way it propels their great ideas inventions and medical protocols into the lives of real people the university is thrilled to be able to provide the logistical assistance and impetus to make this happen in such a dramatic way

1765111 if i get elected it will be on the strength of my ideas and the smaller level of financial support i get from local contributors
1765112 the democrats claim there will be a backlash against them if they prosecute for these very heinous crimes torture illegal spying against our constitutional rights
1765113 i think its very different than clinton perjuring himself perhaps about a private sexual affair he had
1765114 many people have had questions in their mind about why and how the decisions were made that got made i dont discount any of them ive had those same questions in my mind many many times but its clear to me that congress is not going to act on any of this they arent acting on anything at all
1765115 moving forward and fixing the mistakes of the last eight years
1765116 thats lawlessness being ratified by this congress if thats how theyre going forward theyre going in the wrong direction

1765121 how often each video has been viewed during various time periods
1765122 angry youtube patrons began directing a stream of furious videos at viacom and judge stanton for his perceived attack on privacy rights and they continued even after lawyers for the two corporations had negotiated a way to access the records without revealing the personal information of youtube users
1765123 misguided management strategy that its current administration is trying desperately to clean up
1765124 it could be argued that cadwalader is simply acting more like a clear eyed business than like a traditional white shoe law firm where partners can often twist themselves into knots trying to avoid any appearance of weakness
1765125 the strategy certainly has its downsides for the firm like blows to its reputation and perhaps its short term ability to recruit top talent but if the firm stays on its feet which it likely will the bloodletting could provide cover for others to make similar difficult but cost efficient moves
1765126 there was a bubble we rode that bubble it contracted and we adjusted even knowing what i know now i wouldnt have changed a thing
1765127 theres no doubt that this is going to have an impact on our recruiting
1765128 its just hard to gauge exactly what its going to be
1765129 i think this is really about praising people for telling the truth to the wsj before any other media outlets

1765156 we believe wireless and cable assets are great places in which to be invested in uncertain economic times
1765157 economic softness south of the border has had a relatively modest impact on results of bellwether u s wireless carriers and cable operators let alone those in canada
1765158 this critical issue appears to be overlooked by a number of analysts and investors
1765159 we assume churn rises modestly starting in 2010 but precedent shows that rogers has managed to take churn lower even in the midst of competitive price plans new competitive brands and wireless number portability
1765160 the tech telecom market bubble of 1998 2000 and subsequent flurry of bankruptcies clearly showed the challenges of attempting to break into established telecom markets
1765161 we view the impact of new entrants in wireless as akin to start up trust companies attempting to make a go of things in the canadian banking sector
1765162 we believe new entrants will have less of an impact on incumbents than is priced in the market recent precedent shows industry leaders continue to prosper in the face of aggressively priced unlimited calling plans from new entrants
1765163 a flurry of positive developments from increased guidance levels improving sales momentum from iphone dividend increases and competitor setbacks in response we expect a number of analyst upgrades over the next six to 12 months
1765164 apples 3g iphone pricing is clearly attracting many new customers and should boost rogers leading share of post paid net additions
1765165 on the other hand telus is expected to launch exclusively a new touch screen blackberry this fall which could steal some of the bolds thunder albeit temporarily
1765166 contrary to some analyst suggestions incumbent carriers are not exactly slashing price in order to deepen market penetration before new entrants arrive
1765167 rogers may boost its dividend to 1 50 share in january 2009 from the current rate of 1 share at current prices that would exceed a 4 per cent dividend yield and should make rogers an attractive investment substitute for a large percentage of bce shareholders seeking a new home

1765183 people who have fought the civil rights battle politically economically legally as we have since the 50s would often talk about look what would happen if we had an african american president or chairpersons of major congressional committees

1765185 when i saw him over a year ago on c span vigorously opposed to the impeachment of bush and cheney vigorously opposed he said it would be divisive that is a cop out word we have the most multiply impeachable presidency in american history

1765203 a reduction in the amount of disposable income as a result of the current economic climate has played a role in the groups difficulties securing a going concern sale of the business which will protect 300 jobs is positive news for the employees and the industry as a whole

1765227 yep when you know you just know you cant explain it

1765229 the men who were jogging nine times a month were doing much better than those who were jogging only one to eight times a month even those who jogged eight or fewer times a month had a higher bone density than those who did not jog at all

1765232 he wanted to die in the summer and he died in the summer
1765233 he wanted to die at home and he died at home in general i should say that aleksandr isayevich lived a difficult but happy life
1765234 during all the years until 1961 not only was i convinced that i should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime but also i scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything i had written because i feared that this would become known
1765235 finally at the age of 42 this secret authorship began to wear me down
1765236 for a country to have a great writer is like having another government thats why no r gime has ever loved great writers only minor ones
1765237 the grief of our era which i carry about me like an anathema
1765238 for us in russia communism is a dead dog while for many people in the west it is still a living lion
1765239 that the line separating good and evil passes not through states nor between classes nor between political parties either but through all human hearts
1765240 now impacting the coronado police department and ultimately the health safety and welfare of coronado residents
1765241 its a much slower process for us than for the emergency services

1765243 they left croatia because they knew the war was coming

1765245 i was using our tractor doing work for the farmers
1765246 i was pretty handy on it and talked my father into buying a bulldozer
1765247 i was helping run a midget car racing team in america and we had the best driver in the world ron sleepy tripp racing for us
1765248 sleepy was a big sort of guy and i told him if you wanna keep racing youve got to keep fit and eat right
1765249 he took me to this place called wendys on the corner of baker st in newport beach california
1765250 it had a salad bar and i thought this needs to be in new zealand
1765251 wendys was the first fast food chain in the world to do make to order and the first with salads
1765252 very quickly make life a little difficult for the new zealand sailors if there is any loss of face

1765257 what was attractive was not his platform but his attitude
1765258 not so much changes in public policy as validation of their own cultural stance
1765259 better a hole in the shoe than a hole in the head
1765260 yo im so sorry about that and we would buy you a drink while you wait for your order to be corrected but youre only drinking water

1765265 challenge 21 is designed as an extra layer of security for pubs and pub staff
1765266 it supports the work they do to keep preventing alcohol sales to under 18s this poll shows the scheme has achieved very high visibility widespread use and is having an impact
1765267 the poll findings support our separate data which show more than a million people a month are being refused service either because they cant produce id or are underage
1765268 more than 300 000 posters have been sent out and are on display across the pub sector backed up by training at both company and pub level
1765269 i want the law changed to give the british public the right to choose whether they want beer in pints or litres
1765270 we clearly mark that our beer is in litres so everyone knows what they are getting i am looking forward to my day in court because i believe trading standards is wrong
1765271 its a silly law and i have already written to my local mp david miliband and prime minister gordon brown although i believe they may be busy with other issues at the moment i will take this all the way to the house of lords
1765272 yet again we have officials who have failed to exercise any common sense
1765273 this is going to make the government a laughing stock all over europe at the same time they are signing up to the european constitution intent on being good europeans the mad officials on the ground are preparing to hit a polish pub with a 10lb sledgehammer
1765274 although most other goods have to be sold in metric measures of some kind beer and cider must not be sold on draught in metric measures
1765275 in bottles yes but not when it comes to pouring a pint
1765276 draught beer has the unique distinction of being ring fenced so those licensees who would like to sell in metric are actually prevented from so doing
1765277 traditionally when the beans are touching in the pod many quit irrigating
1765278 but some of our better waterers irrigate their soybeans one more time they believe that last irrigation pays
1765279 due to extremely high fuel prices timely and efficient irrigation practices are of the utmost importance this year
1765280 growers have to make good decisions on when to begin and when to stop irrigation
1765281 small soybeans can be irrigated without significant injury to the plants if the water is moved across and leaves the field in a timely manner
1765282 the key is to not let the beans get stressed for moisture no matter the stage of development
1765283 small soybean plants that have not begun to flower have water use requirements
1765284 even though these requirements are not as great as for a plant in the reproductive growth stage water is still critical to the health of small plants
1765285 a single furrow irrigation can provide up to 2 5 inches of water per acre while a center pivot will put out 0 75 to 0 8 inch of water per acre typically three circles with a pivot will provide the same amount of water as a single irrigation with furrow border or flood irrigation
1765286 allowing flood furrow or border irrigation sets to run for much over 12 hours does open the door for injuring small and large soybean plants
1765287 i like 12 hour sets that seems to work better for many farmers and on my familys farm
1765288 utilizing small holes in low volume streams in a single long line and allowing the water to run for more than 24 hours can result in significant injury to soybean due to waterlogging
1765289 this injury typically increases as the plants become more stressed prior to irrigation
1765290 or any tool which allows you to get down 24 inches deep in the soil profile depending on the root depth
1765291 generally soil moisture should be monitored at a depth of at least 8 inches below the soil surface
1765292 however the entire root zone should be checked regularly to evaluate soil moisture through the entire plant root zone
1765293 soil moisture conditions depend on a lot of factors including soil types traffic pans soil depth plant size plant vigor and the environment the root zone of a healthy plant should never go below 50 percent moisture
1765294 if you can leave your finger or palm print in the soil when balling it up in your hand there likely is sufficient moisture at that point
1765295 consumers are cutting back and when we get through the summer travel season and hurricane season we should see a gasoline price decline
1765296 but when sentiment gets poor look for bargains the economy is about to turn
1765297 material costs are high but business debt burdens have been less than consumers thats why so few businesses are going bankrupt companies usually think long term but thats not happening
1765298 wheat is valued fairly oats are over priced the upswing is two thirds through
1765299 up over time the credit crisis now will be another signpost in the chart things will turn back to an upward trend
1765300 there are a number of fungicides in our portfolio that are proven to control ug99 in multi year field trials
1765301 although it can be devastating to an untreated wheat field u s wheat growers would be amply prepared for ug99 with the fungicides available

1765307 after the great start i think we played a very very good defensive game and there were very few big chances for the united states
1765308 my glass is always half full so for us its a new experience to lose a game
1765309 im happy that its the first game and not the last so we still have two more games to go and well take out this part the second half for when we play against japan and new zealand

1765322 i do love all the high school musical girls they are all adorable my little sisters have seen the movie dozens of times
1765323 it was kind of weird because we met and then all of a sudden we had to get into the ring and fight

1765329 one of the oddest things we have encountered in recent years
1765330 this has been the iranian strategy for years to bide their time and continue with their enrichment
1765331 hamas is a terrorist organization that has taken control of the gaza strip and turned it into hostile territory
1765332 hamas is indeed a hostile entity its a hostile entity to the united states as well
1765333 the responsibility for defense against external threats including for defense against external threats from the sea and from the air
1765334 t he united states understands that after israel withdraws from gaza and or parts of the west bank and pending agreements on other arrangements existing arrangements regarding control of airspace territorial waters and land passages of the west bank and gaza will continue
1765335 will sail directly to gaza without going through israeli territory and without seeking permission from israeli authorities
1765336 as part of a final peace settlement israel must have secure and recognized borders which should emerge from negotiations between the parties in accordance with unsc un security council resolutions 242 and 338 in light of new realities on the ground including already existing major israeli populations centers it is unrealistic to expect that the outcome of final status negotiations will be a full and complete return to the armistice lines of 1949 and all previous efforts to negotiate a two state solution have reached the same conclusion it is realistic to expect that any final status agreement will only be achieved on the basis of mutually agreed changes that reflect these realities
1765337 whether getting that buffer is worth the antagonism of the other party
1765338 take a deal that may not perfectly align with the 67 boundaries
1765339 we like mr obama and we hope he will win the election
1765340 i will do my best to achieve peace with our neighbors our first priority should be the palestinians but there are some obstacles
1765341 for the first time in the history of our nation we come upon a development that we are unfamiliar with whereby the ruling party in our midst will come and offer up jerusalem to the worst of our enemies
1765342 jerusalem is not merely the capital of israel but the spiritual capital of jews and christians everywhere its the site of the first and second temples which housed the holy of holies and its the direction in which we jews face when we pray this glorious city of david is bound to the jewish people by an undeniable 3 000 year historical link
1765343 if a land has a soul then jerusalem is the soul of the land of israel
1765344 biometric information on a certain individual that reaches a criminal could be used by the criminal for as long as he wishes
1765345 we are witnessing great achievements on the part of islamic resistance groups in lebanon and the strengthening of hamas in palestine while witnessing the weakening of our enemies more than ever before
1765346 we wont make a big fuss over the delayed response to our nuke offer what matters is to get a clear answer quickly in the coming days
1765347 deeply embarrassing for those who claim there is no extremism in british universities
1765348 you jews should be aware you will never but never have peace with hamas as the ideology that guides them will not allow them to achieve a peace agreement with the jews
1765349 they believe the prophet mohammed fought against the jews and therefore they must continue to fight them to the death

1765354 non solo il principe azzurro che diventa un tronista e gi non mi piaciuto per niente il top stato quando alla fine il principe sceglie un uomo ammettendo candidamente io sono gay allora ho sospeso le riprese con la telecamera tanto mi sono sentito offeso
1765355 non vedo il problema risponde al termine della rappresentazione ho anche distribuito un questionario per il gradimento e nessuno ha avuto da ridire

1765358 should a single worker lose a job the ministers will have to go they are making us pay for mistakes committed by other fellows
1765359 the government ministers have proved their inefficiency beyond all reasonable doubt
1765360 in 1998 the white paper on energy said that government had to invest in electricity infrastructure or face a shortage by 2007
1765361 but the neo liberal agenda adopted under gear led to inaction when bold steps were demanded eskom itself aimed more to increase its return than to ensure supply
1765362 we are adamant however that workers should not be asked to pay for governments failure to invest
1765363 we have made it clear that while we are willing to play a role to solve the problem we cannot ask workers and the poor to bear the brunt of the cost that will only aggravate our social and economic problems in the future
1765364 the inescapable conclusion is that the government is simply giving effect to a dictate of the polokwane conference and the ancs nec national executice committee made with a view to shielding key anc members from effective investigation and prosecution
1765365 a necessary condition for the dsos accomplishments is its prosecution led and intelligence driven investigative approach
1765366 its scorpions independent and impartial approach is nowhere more vividly demonstrated than its pursuit of key government officers and probing into government dealings
1765367 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving

1765377 they are manipulating the system by manipulating the definition of the word abortion
1765378 its another example of this administrations disregard for science and medicine in how agencies make decisions
1765379 its a redefinition of abortion that does not match any of the current medical definitions its ideologically based and not based on science and could interfere with the development of many new therapies to treat diseases

1765386 following our arrival on tuesday we offer our sincere apologies to bocog beijings olympic organizing committee the city of beijing and the people of china if our actions were in any way offensive that was not our intent the wearing of protective masks upon our arrival into beijing was strictly a precautionary measure we as athletes chose to take and was in no way meant to serve as an environmental or political statement we deeply regret the nature of our choices our decision was not intended to insult bocog or countless others who have put forth a tremendous amount of effort to improve the air quality in beijing u s olympic team and feel privileged to represent the united states abroad both on and off the field of play we look forward to putting this incident behind us while we prepare for our competition next week
1765387 since it wasnt late october it probably wasnt the best most opportune time for the athletes to wear those masks

1765414 russian ground attack fighter and army aviation assets are expected to take part in a comprehensive tactical exercise by the belarusian armed forces
1765415 once poland has signed an agreement with the american side on deployment of elements of the missile defense there we will be able to discuss some additional aspects of our military and technical cooperation with belarus the russian military are talking of strategic bombers and iskander systems probably some actions will be taken albeit without belarus regaining its nuclear status
1765416 military experts in moscow have also said russian strategic bombers would not even have to cross the borders of russia or belarus to successfully launch cruise missiles and reduce the planned missile defense in eastern europe to rubble
1765417 since august 2007 russian strategic bombers have carried out about 150 patrol flights with tactical interference of foreign aircraft which accompanied our planes on their missions and in some instances jeopardized the success of these missions
1765418 we are preparing the flights of our strategic aircraft to the indian ocean to practice interoperability with the russian navy task force in the region

1765428 russia and cuba will put their long record of mutually beneficial across the board cooperation to the service of building a new and just world order
1765429 it is an open secret that the west has been establishing a buffer zone around russia during the recent years getting european baltic states ukraine and the caucasus involved in the process the expansion of the russian military presence abroad particularly in cuba could become a response to us led activities
1765430 there are convenient bays for reconnaissance and battleships and a network of so called forward staging posts in cuba we can resume the operation of the radar center in lourdes upon the agreement of the cuban administration a shipment of new radar equipment will be necessary for it though
1765431 used to play the key role in the plans of the russian navy because it was the only base that was capable of providing the presence of russian vessels in the indian ocean and in the persian gulf area the annual rent made up 300 million the technical support center for the russian navy in syrias tartus still operates free of charge

1765445 so the point that i was making at the time was that the political dynamic was the driving force between that sectarian violence and we could try to keep a lid on it but if these underlining dynamic continued to bubble up and explode the way they were then we would be in a difficult situation i am glad that in fact those political dynamic shifted at the same time that our troops did outstanding work

1765452 we are not making a prejudgment but we do expect insurance companies to explain the rate impact of higher gas prices and the resulting dramatic reduction in driving we are seeing in the latest federal statistics

1765475 this is an opportunistic and entirely unwelcome attempt to acquire lonmin at a price which undervalues its unique assets
1765476 its a bit opportunistic because all the mining shares have been so battered in the last six weeks or so obviously xstrata has taken advantage of market weakness mining shares have got so ridiculously cheap i suppose its not impossible there will be bids for others

1765524 consumption of cocaine has become possible for wider and younger sections of society
1765525 a cocaine evening is about as expensive for youngsters as a trip to the cinema
1765526 many youngsters snort it at a party or with friends and many come off the trial phase a short reasonably controlled period of consumption leaves hardly any damage
1765527 longer and increasing use leads to physical problems as a result the drug should not be underestimated
1765528 we have little leeway but that is a general problem and is no different from tobacco prevention what is forbidden is no less attractive maybe even the opposite

1765535 the fact was the market was in no way ready for our message
1765536 it was hours and hours of high anxiety interspersed with brief periods of sheer terror
1765537 before we even buy a radio spot for a client well know how many of a particular group of patients are listening to a specific radio station at a specific time in a specific area
1765538 in 2007 the national association of chain drugstores estimated that owners of about 2 000 independent drugstores were nearing retirement age
1765539 a sign of success and a signal that the community values it
1765540 i believe in the service model of the independent pharmacies where they know their customers talk to their customers and educate their customers
1765541 to watch the business on a daily basis so we can react more quickly to problems and opportunities
1765542 are at least as good as before the acquisitions if not better
1765543 i think weve put together a strong platform for growth as the economy recovers
1765544 we came out far more open and comfortable with each other
1765545 nobody can beat sys windows for energy efficiency as well as sound reduction
1765546 and theyre built to last because theyre designed to handle the moisture that develops with tight windows
1765547 he has a keen understanding of older homes and an impressive eye for architectural detail

1765549 the museum has been an integral part of the universitys commitment to a broad liberal arts education for almost 50 years it has served as a valuable resource for students scholars and visitors alike the name change will help to clearly define our identity as an educational institution that collects cares for exhibits and interprets works of art it is also in alignment with our goal to make our collections exhibitions and public programs more widely known
1765550 we want to see that the project conforms to our rules and regulations any impacts to the wetland resources on the site have to be categorized as to the type of wetlands and we want to make sure theyve avoided impacts to the greatest extent possible
1765551 as a fellow veteran i am truly humbled to speak on behalf of more than 27 000 members of vets for freedom in offering our strong endorsement of charlie summers for united states congress
1765552 serving in combat demands an extremely unique dedication to excellence a true understanding of leadership and an unselfish willingness to serve your country charlie understands this firsthand and its that same perspective that he will use to approach his job as a congressman he knows that the fight we are currently undertaking in iraq and afghanistan is vital to our success in the global effort against islamic extremism
1765553 as the brave men and women who wear our nations uniform continue to serve in harms way it is important that politics end at the waters edge charlies the kind of leader who will not let the washington game playing stand in his way as he fights for the protection of both our national security and our troops i am proud to offer the strong endorsement of vets for freedom
1765554 negara kita mempunyai akta hasutan jika berlaku kemarahan kaum dan penganut agama islam majlis peguam perlu bertanggungjawab

1765558 now that the olympic games are finally upon us its a chance to show how tibetans feel and what their hopes are
1765559 outsiders may think that the tibetans are treated very well and that they are happy but the truth is that tibetans are not free to speak of their suffering
1765560 even if i had to sacrifice my life for this message to be seen by the dalai lama i agree and welcome this chance
1765561 it is very difficult for tibetans to go to beijing and speak out there so that is why we decided to show the real feelings of tibetans inside tibet through this film
1765562 this cab has classic napa characteristics dark fruit aromas of sweet black cherry blackberry and cassis with a light touch of toasty oak its a supple rich and balanced wine complemented by delicately complex accents of strawberry hints of anise mint lilac and rose
1765563 the key with this project is were not flooding the market with different varieties were trying to hit the right on the mark with a solid focused and elegantly structured cabernet sauvignon
1765564 napa cabs can be blockbusters they can be big jammy and sometimes overwhelming working with a small winery we wanted to make it very complex very interesting and very elegant and we are targeting a specific type of wine buyer were honing in on someone who wants to go to a steakhouse and have a very complex red wine but its also a wine that you can have at a barbecue in the backyard its a versatile and sophisticated wine that hits a lot of different bases
1765565 we dont think she has a bearing on our investigation so we are not concentrating on that at the moment we have more important leads to focus on

1765571 she couldnt move and was taken away in an ambulance
1765572 we are shocked at how governmont officials in this country behaved around something like this
1765573 it really shows how they think and how they act its hard to imagine what happens behind closed doors in tibet when they do something like this outside in plain view
1765574 estamos muy emocionados por la salida de la version para pc de gta iv
1765575 el equipo entero esta dedicado a proporcionar una gran experiencia de juego para la pc el juego luce fantastico en la pc y no podemos esperar m s para que la gente lo pueda jugar
1765576 if they charge for it they are going to make millions and millions of dollars
1765577 we get separation anxiety when we are not on the internet for a few hours
1765578 as a result of the stress anxiety and insomnia that i suffered i withdrew socially and often isolated myself from my friends at school my academic performance also deteriorated
1765579 well i think these guys have put in a lot of work theyve improved and now weve got to go play and thats the next step for these guys to actually play in a game and see how we react
1765580 but i like what theyve done so far i like our camaraderie and our energy so now weve got to go do that on the football field there will be a lot of good things that will happen and theyll be some things that we dont like but the big thing about these guys is they come to work every day wanting to be coached
1765581 first of all when you get in the pre season there are a couple of things you try to stress to your team one is for us to play smart play physical and then play fast those are three traits i believe in those three things have to happen that kind of covers the whole gamut
1765582 offensively our ability to move the ball and put some points on the board
1765583 defensively improving on the run and trying to take the ball away those type of things that and tackling how are we going to tackle because we havent tackled somebody since the last game of the season so its been a long time since last tackle those things are the key
1765584 well right now hes penciled in to be a starter unless something happens
1765585 i think every time he plays in a game hes going to improve there are a lot of young guys who are going to play and going to improve
1765586 could be all the way into the second quarter its what they do offensively theyll all play all the quarterbacks will play probably brodie and tyler will play more than damon
1765587 yeah hes going to play hes going to be somewhere around 20 or so snaps and were going to give him the ball about five or six times thats fine for the first game
1765588 its important to have the whole offensive line out there were just missing one guy right now but the rest have been out there herb taylor played last year so its going to be good for him just to keep the same guys in there at the same time is how you grow as an offense
1765589 no because theyre so young you cant stop that no matter what you tell them it doesnt work thats why i say were going to have oxygen on the sideline because after about the third play theyre going to think theyre not in great shape because of anxiety it takes up so much oxygen
1765590 after that theyll be okay these guys will have fun i have the feeling that these guys will have a lot of fun
1765591 if youre a key person and youve done your homework and say well in advance i will be away people tend to respect that
1765592 if you leave people high and dry thats when i believe you come back to a mess
1765593 so we can anticipate anything thats been missed with time to spare
1765594 its really important to plan in advance you have to give people lots of notice and be sure they know what you expect because business should go on as usual when youre away
1765595 at the executive level especially people probably have and should have supports in place
1765596 there are issues involving confidentiality so its something then that has to be done with eyes open
1765597 that the torch is finally in beijing is a realization of a dream weve had for a hundred years
1765598 this is such an important event its so exciting to be here
1765599 but i am also happy because so many old people are able to participate today
1765600 he has gotten me through a lot of tough times i would believe what he has to say i have a lot of respect for him
1765601 i would have the tendency to believe they were telling the truth a little bit more
1765602 as a christian i wouldnt feel it would be my place to judge them
1765603 the faa does in all due respect an incredibly incomplete investigation
1765604 we just want the jury to hear the evidence and make a decision
1765605 last year donovan was the guy and allan had to beat him out
1765606 this year the tables have flipped allan is the guy and sherer has to beat him out i dont want to go with a starter at this point because every day in practice i want to build pressure and build anxiety and see how theyre going to react to it
1765607 whoever plays the best during fall practice will be that guy
1765608 the only way you can build competition is in practice
1765609 im having a great time being a badger and i can see myself having a lot more success here before going to the nfl
1765610 nobody is satisfied with the play last year so were going to come out hungry and ready to go
1765611 last year wasnt a great year but we still made a jan 1 bowl game hopefully this year we can take it a step further and go to a bcs game but people expect certain things from wisconsin weve got to go beyond expectations
1765612 i really like what ive seen out of philip and matt
1765613 i felt both of those guys did a great job in the spring but bottom line is someone is going to be kicking off for the first time not named taylor mehlhaff who we had for the last three years philip has a stronger leg so he has a better chance to be our kickoff guy but for pats and field goals im going to go with whos more consistent in pre practice practice and everything in between the punting position is wide open
1765614 last year we had one night game and it was probably the most energetic most exciting game we had
1765615 i prefer to play at night actually i like to have a little buildup time to get off your feet you have longer to prepare mentally so i prefer night games
1765616 our coaches dont like playing at night period because we hate sitting around all day
1765617 our guys like it because the whole world gets to watch them play on the road we really dont like it because by the time you get home youre already behind and sunday is a big day for us but if espn or abc sets the game time you dont have a say in it what scares us is were going to have to go on the road and play a perfect game and thats hard to do
1765618 thats a tough stadium i dont even think about the time
1765619 thats the craziest to play ive said it since day one
1765620 the fans the people there are ridiculous the jump around the fast wave the slow wave its the craziest place to be our fans are rowdy but theirs are ridiculous theyre nice but they go hard during the game they want to win that game
1765621 people can say whatever they want but it comes down to us doing what we have to do and players making plays
1765622 what started off as the occasional headache nausea and stomach aches resulted in a chronic headache vomiting lack of concentration and rapid weight loss i had to opt for one month of leave to get back to normalcy
1765623 acidity was always my grandmothers health concern certainly not mine
1765624 i use to stay in a hostel had oily fried food everyday the competition of hits and misses and deadline pressure at work added to the problem he says
1765625 acidity normally hits you at night with excess gas formation in the tummy
1765626 acidity tends to have a much higher incidence in highly emotional and nervous individuals
1765627 the most common symptom is dyspepsia a burning or aching pain in the upper abdomen heartburn is characterised by a deeply placed burning pain in the chest and it occurs after meals
1765628 we first check the history of family members with ulcers and advise the patient to stop consumption of alcohol and smoking
1765629 though its easier said than done i tell my patients to relax and pretend nothing is wrong with them
1765630 eat only when hungry because digestive juices are released in the stomach only when one is hungry otherwise undigested food in the stomach leads to fermentation

1765634 where coupons become a currency it reflects the rapidly falling value of the zimbabwe dollar barter selling provides something that holds its value

1765637 we fully support openmokos decision to publish the schematics of the u blox gps receivers
1765638 it is vitally important that developers have access to this data and it improves product quality going forward we think that more manufactures and more consumers will demand open architecture products with optimum performance
1765639 why should industry be afraid of opening up its design
1765640 schematics are simply another form of documentation and vital to future success service and satisfaction in the market we believe our products would be incomplete without them
1765641 one of the freedoms we value the most is the freedom to explore to fully understand the details of complex systems to adapt and enhance them
1765642 we now take our commitment to openness to the next level by releasing our schematics to the public allowing anyone to find out how the system works and how to improve it

1765644 we have an indisputable international law obligation that conflicts with state law
1765645 the supreme court has ruled the president has neither the constitutional power nor the legislative authority to overturn the state rules
1765646 its silence is no surprise the united states has not wavered in its position that petitioner was not prejudiced by his lack of consular access
1765647 even president bush who signed scores of death warrants as texas governor concurred some time ago that the united states must honor its international obligations in this case
1765648 there will be no clearer sign that texas will have gone beyond the pale than if jose medellins execution goes forward

1765657 but you do not want to get on the plane and decide thats where youre going to download the digital version of gone with the wind

1765662 we got delayed and sat on a runway for the entire super bowl
1765663 it wasnt extraordinarily fast but it was quite adequate and it was a good service
1765664 we are so connected between blackberries and everything else that anxiety sets in for a lot of people
1765665 theyre afraid not to be connected theyre afraid of what they might miss for an hour an hour and a half im fine two or three hours i dont know

1765670 that he had incredible paranoid delusional thoughts at times and feared that he might not be able to control his behavior
1765671 greyhound knows how important it is to get these removed and we are doing everything possible
1765672 this is something that we immediately asked to be done last week realizing that these could be offensive
1765673 i dont know if the panel can render fair what has already happened
1765674 the military commission system is a fair and appropriate legal process for prosecuting detainees alleged to have committed crimes against the united states or our interests
1765675 we look forward to other cases moving forward to trial
1765676 i hope they release us tonight so we can go home
1765677 there must be some reason why they have brought us here
1765678 the taliban are trying to reassert control not only in terms of fighting and taking control of a town militarily but also trying to put into place other structures of government that will build legitimacy
1765679 they insist on the local people going there rather than to the police or the official courts
1765680 there have been no choppings of hands because there are no thieves
1765681 one of my friends is a judge and the taliban sent him letters telling him to stop working the second letter said well kill you if you work
1765682 also they issued a fatwa religious edict that anyone who works with the government will be killed
1765683 im a journalist and this is a new thing that is happening in ghazni
1765684 the taliban were doing this sort of thing when they were in power but never since they fell
1765685 now is not the time for this kind of talk its over now
1765686 we did wrong it was a mistake we wont do it again
1765687 the courts run by the government are active around the country
1765688 i think this icc indictment is providing us more opportunities
1765689 as to whether it translates to any positive or negative effect on us i dont think so
1765690 the goal is to try to get either the supreme court or the congress to get the policy changed at the national level
1765691 any standards that are applied to groups based on race any jobs where there are different standards for admissions
1765692 you have to adopt narrowly tailored measures to help you overcome that disparity
1765693 rather than engage in divisive ballot initiatives we must have a dialogue and cooperation and mutual efforts together to provide for every child in america to fulfill their expectations
1765694 if you put things in deceptive terms like if you say were trying to get civil rights protections for everybody then you know people say yes
1765695 we are not mouthpieces we are not gunslingers that do the bidding of someone whose rationale we do not share and whose view of the world
1765696 we feel that the request is beyond what we should be asked to do beyond what our professional ethics allow us to do

1765785 some proposals are not considered proper under state law if they would be binding on the company if approved by shareholders
1765786 i think those of us from delaware would say one of the things the commission could do to facilitate this is to make clear that if its uncertain under state law and its a by law proposal then it shouldnt be excluded and they should be able to put it on absent some showing and then leave it to us hold us accountable and if we make the wrong decisions you can bet we are going to hear about it from the institutional investor community and from the management community
1765787 there were 186 proposals sponsored by unions or affiliates of unions but just three unions accounted for 94 of the proposals so the data shows that a relatively small number of investors are responsible for a significant portion of the shareholder proposals
1765788 abusive use of the shareholder proposal process by some institutional investors is troubling

1765831 studies show that fatty streak lesions in the arteries that are a precursor to atherosclerosis and heart disease begin in childhood and advanced lesions are not uncommon by age 30 why not nip things in the bud
1765832 the weapons for those wars education and behavior modification are the same as those needed for a war on coronary heart disease
1765833 a concerted national effort might dramatically reduce morbidity and mortality due to three major chronic diseases it would take generations to achieve and it would require an all out commitment of money and manpower to reeducate and modify the behavior of a nation is that impossible no we have already shown that even a frankly addictive behavior like cigarette smoking can be overcome eventually

1765857 its a pleasure to hear a group that has constantly defied the odds still sound fresh and vibrant this is very much a for against of now rather than of then the sweet melancholia of the past turned both more haunted and more angry runnings seemingly deathless voice retains its light clear quality as all the groups albums have always shown but matched again with dingmans powerful playing it just seems all that much more right
1765858 for against have been nothing short of great since their formation in 1985 and shade side sunny side is the bands best effort yet the interplay between dingmans guitar pyrotechnics and frontman jeffrey runnings low rumbling bass put the likes of interpol and the killers to shame this is what post punk is supposed to sound like
1765859 factory records is a clearer influence than ever and their musicianship is right up there with those legendary bands this might be their toughest most powerful lp yet theyre not building on past successes theyre making exciting music today setting mighty fires of their own
1765860 they make their icy gloom appealing in a way nobodys really managed since the comsat angels packed it in its good to know theyre out there getting better with age and staying true to their sound despite geographical isolation
1765861 with their balance of euphoria and miserablism nailed down to perfection remarkably for against seem to have reached a peak after all this time

1765872 el torneo ol mpico no figura en el calendario oficial de la fifa y no hay una decisi n del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca una obligaci n de poner a disposici n a jugadores menores de 23 a os para este campeonato

1765876 theres a tremendous amount of data we can collect about the ads and the users who see them
1765877 i guess i just cant believe kids can be that destructive quite honestly unless they were just on a dare
1765878 there is a noticeable aesthetic shift happening in the face and that it s dovetailing with quantum leaps in plastic surgery and dermatology
1765879 it seems clear that once we became obsessed with the baby face of the teenage girl the world of dermatology came up with more and better ways for us to achieve the plumpness of youth
1765880 i have been saying that there should have been no ban on simi and if at all simi has to be banned then why not shiv sena and durga vahini
1765881 there is no need to impose a ban on simi this should not have been done even earlier
1765882 the all party meeting was of the unanimous view that an environment must be created where the agitation could be suspended and the issue resolved through the process of dialogue
1765883 the only language that the akalis understand is that of aggression and i will let myself loose on them with a series of rallies and other political events
1765884 i dont want to continue as minister in the government which was inactive and taking anti people decisions like the revenue loss likely to incur due to allotment of land at a throwaway price of rs 300 crores to videocon which can generate rs 3 000 crores
1765885 there arent any other treatments for depression that have been found to be superior to ect
1765886 we talk about cognitive deficits and memory loss really thats brain damage
1765887 quite frankly the stigma pushes people away from it and it pushes some psychiatrists away from even recommending ect
1765888 but most of the stigma related to ect really is related to misconception
1765889 i thought thats drastic that causes brain damage theres no way i want to do that
1765890 i can remember seeing one person in the waiting room that really looked out of it just like a zombie sort of
1765891 i was just thinking oh god no i dont want to end up like that

1765893 were on our way to do that whether we get any information from him or not we dont know
1765894 this person back in your jail is now a person of interest in our investigation of that case
1765895 we were never able to pin anything down on him never were really able to figure out where he came from what he had done he was one of these people that kind of appeared and then disappeared and no one seemed to know anything about him
1765896 so am i gonna be the first american guy youre gonna kiss

1765900 the kids raved about it and the first friday night after it was assigned the students were texting each other saying they couldnt put it down

1765910 at the request of our customers we introduced our affiliate program seven months ago
1765911 weve seen outstanding success so far which has led to enhancements including increases in affiliate commissions and a shortened payout waiting period at the conference we expect to forge new partnerships and we invite prospects to stop by our table to learn how they can make money simply by referring customers to the planet
1765912 we have basic safety regulations for nearly every product a consumer can buy except the ones that ruin them financially
1765913 we would not be where we are today with home mortgage foreclosures and millions of families in bankruptcy or on the brink of economic collapse if we had had better regulation of financial products
1765914 if we had 1 2 million people whose toasters had exploded this year we would not be saying they should have checked the wiring more closely before they bought those things
1765915 we would say those are products that should not have been put on the market i completely understand it makes no sense to try to insure that every product will be 100 percent safe but consumers should not be faced with products that are so unsafe that they will cost them their homes
1765916 the anti regulation folks say all regulation is bad and yet we live in a world where regulation works most of the time
1765917 we dont eat tainted meat and we dont drink adulterated milk because we have fairly good regulation financial products are no different free markets are not well supported when consumers are at risk for injury
1765918 while we hope that the federal government takes some action to wait on somebody else to protect our citizens would be irresponsible we also feel pretty strongly that this bill can serve as a blueprint for the federal government

1765929 sales declined 12 per cent last month from the best ever july 2007 record of 8 912 but increased 10 per cent from the 7 082 sales transacted in july 2006
1765930 comparing july 2007 with july 2006 sales increased by 26 per cent
1765931 while homeowners continue to see healthy returns it is taking slightly longer to achieve a sale the average time on market has increased to 33 days compared to 31 days a year ago
1765932 this may be due to that fact that there is now more choice available to homebuyers there are currently 26 543 active listings a 28 per cent increase from a year ago
1765933 freddie mac on wednesday posted a second quarter loss that was more than

1765937 this has been a transformational year with the successful sale of ufindus for 20m and the development of our complex managed hosting business using our own network of carrier neutral datacentres we are now well positioned to address our chosen market with the firepower to make strategic acquisitions in combination with our organic growth
1765938 our focus on the data centre offering is paying off and were in a great position to win more high margin corporate business a complete one source managed hosting service is very different to whats on offer from other providers ie space and power only which puts us in a very strong position in the market
1765939 weve equipped our four data centres with the latest technology and ensured that we have ample power to cope with expected future computing demands we suffer none of the legacy problems that face many of todays operators and this coupled with a decade of hosting expertise has been a significant selling point for us this has been demonstrated by the group winning its largest single contract worth 5 75m over 5 years with bt
1765940 we recognise that we have a corporate social and commercial responsibility to achieve the most efficient data centres that we can and we will constantly seek to reduce our environmental impact where possible
1765941 with the sale of ufindus we find ourselves in the enviable position of having sufficient funding to fully underwrite our current business plans without having to place reliance on borrowing facilities at this testing time in the credit market we will be exploring a number of acquisition opportunities during the next year which will enable us to add revenues skills and savings to the group

1765970 la stanchezza e linsicurezza di tante brave persone che abitano il nostro paese
1765971 lincredulit nella nostra comunit regna sovrana il rispetto per alcune istituzioni oramai prossimo allo zero
1765972 la famiglia stata vittima pi di una volta di furti di vario genere scrive il sindaco senza che mai i carabinieri e la magistratura abbiano dato risposte al cittadino facendo aumentare a dismisura i furti sia in paese che nelle campagne non ultimo i vari furti avvenuti negli anni passati presso la sede comunale che solo grazie alle informazioni che alcuni cittadini hanno dato al sottoscritto hanno fatto recuperare parte della refurtiva ormai la gente arrabbiata per la mancanza di risposte da di parte coloro che sono preposti allordine pubblico
1765973 le nostre caserme sono diventate luoghi di pubblico impiego i cittadini sono sfiduciati perch non vedono mai uninchiesta andare avanti era cos imprevedibile che prima o poi sarebbe successo lincidente era cosi imprevedibile pensare che un semplice cittadino possa compiere gesti non confacenti alla propria cultura evidentemente lesasperazione porta a simili gesti e spinge un bravo cittadino a diventare un vendicatore dei torti subiti
1765974 uno dei denuncianti era la persona che anche ieri ha subito il furto e laccusato era lo stesso di questa vicenda
1765975 io continua manoccio mi sento con la coscienza a posto altri sicuramente non possono dire altrettanto oggi una famiglia viene portata alle cronache per il gesto compiuto per me sindaco di acquaformosa quella famiglia un esempio di gente per bene di seri lavoratori di uomini e donne che possono camminare a testa alta altri comprese tante istituzioni non possono dire altrettanto perch gi precedentemente avvisati ed a conoscenza dei fatti
1765976 it is definitely the most complicated case ive ever had in my years of being here
1765977 theres a certain level of excitement that were now ready to present evidence to a jury
1765978 i think its always important after a long process in a case where youve litigated many pretrial issues
1765979 thats an unfortunate comment on the state of our city and community
1765980 can i can we change this and make tucson more hospitable to this group of people

1765988 the questions that are bound to arise after the war
1765989 pick up a ball son go out and entertain me
1765990 they are bookcases and ive used them for years i just dont want to move them
1765991 we dont have no use for them not used they been painted

1765994 allow more people to get e mail addresses they really want
1765995 give them an excellent starting point for their online experience
1765996 it was said to be one of the most curable cancers
1765997 i dont want cancer to win the battle or the war
1765998 i live in fear daily a lot of dealing with it is up to god who is in control of it
1765999 because heather wanted to do the marathon were going to do it regardless
1766000 ive had cancer for five years and have not been outspoken about it
1766001 i pretend i dont have it its about time i spoke out about it i do have a voice and need to be heard if i can touch at least one person thats good enough for me
1766002 i had a radiation tech three years ago who was in a marathon and really loved it
1766003 this year i said i really have to do this everyone says its a great thing to be in

1766006 together we will help cure cancer one mile at a time
1766007 ive never seen more people on the road than i have recently
1766008 we really wanted to look at making penfields roads safer for bicyclists and make penfield more of a biking kind of town
1766009 what we had to do was establish a starting point
1766010 what we did with the steering committee was to identify priority destinations and roads to reach them and examined needs for improvements on those roads
1766011 those were the routes that the bicycle committee selected as logical linkages between the destinations that were identified
1766012 they become the first round of roads in penfield to receive improvements in terms of bicycle traffic
1766013 the primary topic that everyone wants to discuss when we talk about bicycling is safety
1766014 everyone wants to have a sense of comfort that the road is being shared
1766015 theres a few places like that in town where conditions change
1766016 ideally have a shoulder and some awareness around that its a shared roadway
1766017 most people will actually feel climate change delivered to them by the postman
1766018 twenty years ago if i had told the people of ilulissat that it would rain at christmas 2007 they would have just laughed at me today it is a reality

1766026 the cinematheque in paris is getting ready to do this show theyre taking half of my art collection and half of my own stuff and filling a whole room with a virtual reality exhibit and then theyre showing 50 films seven films i directed and the others that i acted in
1766027 its all based on how easy rider influenced cinema its just amazing i cant wait to see it all
1766028 ultimately the problem here is with communications or lack thereof from apple
1766029 if you have an important point to make dont try to be subtle or clever use a pile driver hit the point once then come back and hit it again then hit it a third time a tremendous whack

1766031 help yourself to some tapes of confidential information i know you wont do anything with it
1766032 clearly mayor eisenberger has insinuated that mr dovey was the individual who stole the audio tape that is confirmed by the fact that immediately after the press conference the media contacted my office asking for comment from mr dovey about the alleged theft his name was also linked to the alleged theft in the newspaper and on the internet
1766033 if my zelda knowledge has taught me anything its that pots must be smashed

1766038 o henry born william sydney porter may have been the master of the popular short story form but he was far less skilled when it came to money while working as a bank teller in houston the fledgling author was accused of embezzling a few thousand dollars prompting his rather sudden move to honduras but a few years later when he came back to visit his dying wife he was arrested and sentenced to five years in prison it was here that convict porter assumed the pen name o henry his incarceration offered him the time to write as well as a chance to mix with a slew of seedy characters perfect fodder for his fiction a model inmate porter was released in 1901 after serving just three years he passed away in 1910 with 600 stories but reportedly only 33 cents to his name
1766039 i would emphasize that the crew did a great job to undertake a hull flooding repair like that underway and to do it as effectively as they did it is really commendable
1766040 we got all our plays in again i actually thought we were behind at one point but we were going so fast that i didnt even realize it
1766041 we were still a little sloppy and had a few problems with the center quarterback exchange and i thought toward the end we started to get tired and lost concentration and communication a bit
1766042 we put more in today but weve got to start to build and get better at concentrating toward the end of practice and finish the day off
1766043 i spent countless hours in the summer rehabbing it and so far everything feels good and im just ready to get back out there
1766044 im going to be graduating here in four months and when thats done i cant just go to job interviews with any haircut i want
1766045 so ive always wanted a mohawk my parents wouldnt let me get one as a kid
1766046 and i figured ive only got four or five months until i enter the real world so i might as well do it now
1766047 so what we all know the amount of io is so high theres no chance of cutting into good interruptions and information flows anyways
1766048 my assertion is that that coming at this as an
1766049 a peek at the classroom of 2015 a person can see how classrooms have changed through the years
1766050 a peek at the classroom of 2015 illustrates how much knowledge of technology both the students and teachers have

1766055 pursue righteousness godliness faith love endurance gentleness fight the good fight of the faith take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and for which you made the good confession in front of many witnesses
1766056 in this life that we call home the years go fast and the days go so slow the days go so slow the days so slow
1766057 ive spent my 20s on tour and theres no consistency in my life which can take its toll
1766058 eventually i want to focus on being a completely different person because i dont want to be doing this into my 40s and 50s and beyond like the rolling stones
1766059 i dont want to give it up just yet though i think we have a little more to say
1766060 if israel approves this west bank settlement it will be breaking repeated promises to halt all new settlement activity and violating international law
1766061 rather than expanding these illegal settlements the israeli government should be dismantling them
1766062 the demographic changes will have to be considered and the population centers most likely will have to be taken into account
1766063 the united states should make clear that it will have nothing to do with illegal new settlement construction
1766064 are not only illegal under international law but are an obstacle to the enjoyment of human rights by the whole population without distinction as to national or ethnic origin
1766065 im really excited to get the guys out there on the practice field so we can begin our preparation for the season
1766066 the team has worked really hard all summer with strength and conditioning coach matt walter and now its time for us to come together as a team and go to work
1766067 were not just talking about forests out in the woods were talking about trees in neighborhoods and suburbs along streets
1766068 possibly at some point this week but not today well issue details of a precise date
1766069 it the date for a market link has drifted and drifted
1766070 what you really cant put a number on is the impact on sentiment
1766071 i think what we want to do is uniformly raise the bar
1766072 possibly at some point this week well issue details of a precise date
1766073 we are negotiating with the u n climate agency to decide on the date
1766074 we had a successfull test run now we have to see that the u n is also ready so settting the date is under negotiation it should be shortly
1766075 this now paves the way for the transfer of credits from the clean development mechanism into the eu registry system
1766076 weve documented the timing and the magnitude of a tremendous change in antarctic climate
1766077 the fossil finds allow us to examine antarctica as it existed just prior to climate cooling at 13 9 million years ago it is a unique window into the past to study these deposits is akin to strolling across the dry valleys 14 1 million years ago
1766078 they are the first to be found even though scientific expeditions have been visiting the dry valleys since their discovery during the first scott expedition in 1902 1903
1766079 if we can understand how we got into this relatively cold climate phase then that can help predict how global warming might push us back out of this phase
1766080 studies like ours that establish when and how climate thresholds were crossed along the way can be used to predict climate thresholds going the opposite direction from cool to warm
1766081 although to be fair were looking at one that is very far away warming would have to be greater than what is predicted for the next one or two centuries to cause a melting of the east antarctic ice sheet the west antarctic ice sheet is much more vulnerable
1766082 to be able to identify living species amongst the fossils is phenomenal to think that modern counterparts have survived 14 million years on earth without any significant changes in the details of their appearances is striking it must mean that these organisms are so well adapted to their habitats that in spite of repeated climate changes and isolation of populations for millions of years they have not become extinct but have survived
1766083 waitaminute did they say ninja what is this feudal japan
1766084 today the focus for lenders is not so much on consumer loans being repaid but on the loan as a perpetual earning asset
1766085 2005 bankruptcy reform benefited credit card companies and hurt their customers
1766086 i understand the position your agency is in mrs gray
1766087 but capital one has no one to blame but itself no one forced them to change the bankruptcy laws to squeeze more from customers they did that to themselves and it is not my fault that they made it impossible to pay their credit card
1766088 and i am glad to help pay that debt mrs gray however our options are limited right now i am two months away from paying off a different credit card i have an automatic 100 debit every month and thats paid in september so after that two months i can pay you
1766089 why not that debts been sitting for three years and no ones called about it i think you can wait another two months and then ill set up a payment plan with you

1766091 look mrs gray youre not going to get blood from a stone
1766092 just like everyone else i am having trouble paying my bills too
1766093 you see what i mean im afraid youll simply have to wait your turn in line or maybe you could call the government for a bailout i hear that works really well for corporations like yours
1766094 im really sympathetic to you mrs gray really i am its not your agencys fault that capital one decided to hit their customers with interest payments and fees no one can afford and its not your agencys fault that capital one decided they needed that bankruptcy bill which is a classic case of be careful what you wish for but im in good standing with my other debts and cant sacrifice what good accounts i have to settle up your old debt im not robbing peter to pay paul
1766095 mr skwire ive been doing collections work for years lets discuss your options
1766096 im on my bicycle in center city philadelphia commuting home because gasoline is so expensive now and if i get hit by a car ill be dead and then no one gets paid call me tomorrow at 1 00 or so
1766097 im fed up with credit card company tricks that drive us deeper in debt
1766098 the focus for lenders is not so much on consumer loans being repaid but on the loan as a perpetual earning asset
1766099 96 wine 4 packaging made largly of renewable resources rock on did i mention it was only 6 99 at newpi here are the reviews
1766100 yeah i like this and i dont generally like wine
1766101 weve been given to understand that hamas plans to introduce taxes on electricity bills in the gaza strip this would not allow us to continue paying for fuel were ready to resume payments within hours once we have assurances that these taxes will not be introduced
1766102 hai orang orang yang beriman jika kamu menolong agama allah nescaya dia allah akan menolongmu dan meneguhkan kedudukanmu
1766103 kamu tahu bahwa tidak seorangpun yang dibenarkan oleh karena melakukan hukum taurat tetapi hanya oleh karena iman dalam kristus yesus
1766104 karena aku bukan menerimanya dari manusia dan bukan manusia yang mengajarkannya kepadaku tetapi aku menerimanya oleh penyataan yesus kristus
1766105 dan di dalam agama yahudi aku jauh lebih maju dari banyak teman yang sebaya dengan aku di antara bangsaku sebagai orang yang sangat rajin memelihara adat istiadat nenek moyangku
1766106 tetapi waktu ia yang telah memilih aku sejak kandungan ibuku dan memanggil aku oleh kasih karunia nya
1766107 berkenan menyatakan anak nya di dalam aku supaya aku memberitakan dia di antara bangsa bangsa bukan yahudi maka sesaatpun aku tidak minta pertimbangan kepada manusia
1766108 juga aku tidak pergi ke yerusalem mendapatkan mereka yang telah menjadi rasul sebelum aku tetapi aku berangkat ke tanah arab dan dari situ kembali lagi ke damsyik
1766109 namun bagi kita hanya ada satu allah saja yaitu bapa yang dari pada nya berasal segala sesuatu dan yang untuk dia kita hidup dan satu tuhan saja yaitu yesus kristus yang oleh nya segala sesuatu telah dijadikan dan yang karena dia kita hidup
1766110 engkau diberi melihatnya untuk mengetahui bahwa tuhanlah allah tidak ada yang lain kecuali dia
1766111 aku diutus hanya kepada domba domba yang hilang dari umat israel
1766112 hukum yang terutama ialah dengarlah hai orang israel tuhan allah kita tuhan itu esa
1766113 sebab bersunat atau tidak bersunat tidak penting yang penting ialah mentaati hukum hukum allah
1766114 dan orang yang tidak disunat yakni laki laki yang tidak dikerat kulit khatannya maka orang itu harus dilenyapkan dari antara orang orang sebangsanya ia telah mengingkari perjanjian ku
1766115 kristus telah menebus kita dari kutuk hukum taurat dengan jalan menjadi kutuk karena kita sebab ada tertulis
1766116 orang yang berbuat dosa itu yang harus mati anak tidak akan turut menanggung kesalahan ayahnya dan ayah tidak akan turut menanggung kesalahan anaknya orang benar akan menerima berkat kebenarannya dan kefasikan orang fasik akan tertanggung atasnya
1766117 ketika yesus melihat hal itu ia marah dan berkata kepada mereka
1766118 segala sesuatu halal bagiku tetapi bukan semuanya berguna segala sesuatu halal bagiku tetapi aku tidak membiarkan diriku diperhamba oleh suatu apa pun
1766119 ia mengajarkan bahwa tuhan bukan satu tetapi dua yaitu allah bapa dan allah anak
1766120 yesus telah disalib mati dan dikuburkan bangkit pula pada hari yang ketiga duduk disebelah kanan allah bapa yang maha kuasa ia disalib adalah untuk menebus isi dunia ini sebab sekaliannya telah berdosa tidak ada seorangpun yang dibenarkan lagi termasuk dia sendiri dan nabi besar muhammad s a w
1766121 pejabat pejabat itu menyampaikan perkataan itu kepada pembesar pembesar kota ketika mereka mendengar bahwa paulus dan silas adalah orang rom maka takutlah mereka
1766122 hai saudara saudaraku aku adalah orang farisi keturunan orang farisi aku dihadapkan ke mahkamah ini karena aku mengharap akan kebangkitan orang mati
1766123 maka kecelakaan yang besarlah bagi orang orang yahudi amp kristian yang menulis alkitab dengan tangan mereka sendiri lalu dikatakannya ini dari allah untuk memperolehi keuntungan yang sedikit dengan perbuatan itu maka kecelakaan besarlah bagi mereka akibat dari apa yang ditulis oleh tangan mereka sendiri dan kecelakaan besarlah bagi mereka akibat dari apa yang mereka kerjakan

1766142 when the economy picks up as it surely will once obama is elected
1766143 republican john mccain and democrat barack obama are once again tied in the latest gallup poll daily obama received a brief increase in support near the conclusion of his overseas trip last week gaining a nine percentage point advantage in july 24 26 polling but that bounce disappeared almost quickly as it emerged
1766144 famous for no reason just a pretty face the ad implies but loitering below is something more nefarious obama dog whistles the ad hitting old racists in the sweet spot could f k these white girls
1766145 ive covered a lot of campaigns and ive never seen anything like this
1766146 presidential election campaigns usually youre working all the time you get to the hotel at two in the morning and youre back on the plane at six but mccain does one event a day one event its unbelievable

1766158 but so far we havent received any official request from maybank asking for such dispensation
1766159 when i heard about this campaign i wanted to do something positive and fun at the same time as helping to raise awareness of the plight of women in poorer countries to show them they are not alone

1766162 leave them alone for if their purpose or activity is of human origin it will fail but if it is from god you will not be able to stop them you will only find yourselves fighting against god
1766163 greater love has no one than this that he lay down his life for his friends
1766164 this study is excellent its the best evidence that this higher level of exercise is needed
1766165 thirty minutes a day is good for general health but if you want to lose weight you need to be doing more and if you want to sustain weight loss you need to be doing even more than that
1766166 in this country between an hour and 90 minutes of exercise a day is the recommended level for maintaining weight loss
1766167 sitting at ones desk uses barely any more calories than staying in bed but walking at 1mph while working increases caloric expenditure by approximately 125 calories an hour

1766177 lot of action in sca in after hours yesterday and todays pre market with some news yesterday can you share your thoughts and update on this from you
1766178 la calidad de trabajo ha sido bueno en venezuela hemos jugado con dos equipos de buen nivel de futbol y con las dificultades pese al cambio de costumbre de espa a a este pa s y realmente nos iremos muy satisfechos
1766179 es verdad que el a o pasado tuvimos dificultades en la delantera estuvimos mejor en la segunda parte de la liga y ahora intentamos ajustar todas las l neas para que el equipo apueste por la posesi n de bal n e intentamos ser ahora m s desequilibrantes y con m s profundidad
1766180 ser un orgullo poder jugar contra ellos ser un partido muy disputado
1766181 hay gente con peque as molestias entre ellos est n descartados z castro y antonio tom s del resto valer n entren bien y pudiera tener minutos as como guardado estar y bravo tambi n
1766182 es un gran honor representar a mi pa s nuevamente en un juegos ol mpicos nuestro objetivo y el m o personal es ganar la primera medalla de oro para nuestro futbol a eso vine a china
1766183 si logra trabajar bien y si hace las cosas como sabe tendr muchas posibilidades de ganar la medalla
1766184 el rival m s fuerte ser argentina una selecci n excelente que merece mi respeto cuenta con grandes jugadores de calidad mundial a los que conocemos muy bien pero nosotros tambi n tenemos lo nuestro y merecemos el respeto de los dem s
1766185 todos han sido muy amables con nosotros es incre ble ahora es nuestro turno de devolverles tanta calidez con buenas actuaciones en el campo de juego nuestra expectativa es avanzar lo m ximo posible en el torneo y alcanzar las semifinales si eso sucede llegaremos a la villa pero es importante no perder el foco y avanzar poco a poco para conseguirlo
1766186 muy feliz por haber firmado para un club tan grande y prestigioso como el mil n
1766187 sta ser a mi ltima oportunidad antes de pensar en buscar otro equipo pero hay que aprovecharla y mantenerme porque cuando lo hice en el torneo pasado me mantuve hasta jugar las finales de libertadores
1766188 no s tendr a que hablar con la directiva porque ya son varios torneos en los cuales yo me he sentido con muchas ganas con mucha motivaci n de poner mi nombre aqu en la instituci n en alto y que sin duda lo he mostrado en algunos partidos pero hay que hablar tambi n el aspecto de que si no estoy jugando a uno le gusta estar jugando en la cancha y que si no es aqu puede ser en otro lado
1766189 no me ha ense ado nada me ha dejado no buenos recuerdos por m s que uno quiera estar adentro y peleando con los diez compa eros en la cancha afuera se vive peor de lo que est adentro ahora lo viv en estos dos partidos m s ahora en toluca con la impotencia de estar uno afuera y con las ganas de demostrarle al t cnico y ganarse la confianza y estar en el once
1766190 what is the average guys threat and how does he prepare accordingly
1766191 hey was that paul mccartney at the at the museum in joliet illinois
1766192 come and take him by force to make him king
1766193 the military judge abused his discretion in fashioning the sweeping remedy that he did
1766194 unlawful command influence is the mortal enemy of military justice
1766195 the appearance of unlawful command influence is as devastating as actual manipulation of a trial
1766196 there is no evidence that gen mattis relied on col ewers for any information opinions or legal advice
1766197 instead the record shows gen mattis to be an independent commander highly unlikely to be prone to manipulation by his staff officers
1766198 gen mattis used the word never 10 times in answering questions about whether col ewers had provided any legal advice with respect to chessanis case or any haditha case
1766199 never spoke to me about this case nor would i have asked him for any information or advice a strict firewall was maintained
1766200 but we will fight this unjust prosecution as long as it takes

1766213 with the goal of bringing down prices at the pump
1766214 if you are going to tackle climate change and curb energy use you have to deal with consumer devices like pcs
1766215 there are large potential savings beyond what energy star can do
1766216 what were trying to do is raise the visibility of the power consumption problem on the pc desktop and really bring power management to the masses
1766217 the government and the energy companies have decided that replacing kingsnorth will be a symbol that britain is able to use a form of energy generation that produces massive amounts of harmful co2
1766218 but we determined that our protest will also be a symbol
1766219 if we can stop this power station being built then we will make it much harder for the authorities to defy public pressure and build other coal fired stations in the future
1766220 when the time is right they will move together streaming into the power station to shut it down
1766221 if the law protects the right of industries to destroy the planet then it is up to people like us to prevent that even if it means breaking the law
1766222 while we completely respect the protesters right to campaign peacefully what is not acceptable are their plans to invade the power station
1766223 power stations are not adventure playgrounds and if anyone does get in they will be putting their safety and the safety of our workers at risk
1766224 what we have found is a bunch of intelligent and articulate people who have set a real example to us
1766225 all that means is that more coal will be burned and the pollution will remain
1766226 no one actually knows how much coal we will need to burn when the new power station is built that depends on market conditions
1766227 we are about pushing for radical social change about the whole way the economy works
1766228 these plants may look good in your garden but many are pernicious and pose a real problem to the native vegetation and ecosystem
1766229 they can badly affect the ecology of our rivers and because many of them die down in winter they leave the banks bare and exposed to greater erosion
1766230 along with climate change invasive non indigenous plants are a major challenge to biodiversity
1766231 it doesnt just affect native plants but the fauna as well its all linked
1766232 himalayan balsam can spread up to 10 metres every year we go in july and august before they have chance to seed so hopefully there will be fewer next year
1766233 you will show my head to the people it is worth seeing
1766234 all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me
1766235 go make disciples baptizing teaching them to obey everything i have commanded you
1766236 in the name of the father and the son and the holy spirit
1766237 surely i am with you always to the very end of the age
1766238 from the viewpoint of science the north pole is just another point on the globe but symbolically it is hugely important there is supposed to be ice at the north pole not open water
1766239 the issue is that for the first time that i am aware of the north pole is covered with extensive first year ice ice that formed last autumn and winter id say its even odds whether the north pole melts out
1766240 indeed for the arctic as a whole the melt season started with even more thin ice than in 2007 hence concerns that we may even beat last years sea ice minimum well see what happens a great deal depends on the weather patterns in july and august
1766241 theres a good chance that it will all melt away at the north pole its certainly feasible but its not guaranteed
1766242 last year we saw huge areas of the ocean open up which has never been experienced before people are expecting this to continue this year and it is likely to extend over the north pole it is quite likely that the north pole will be exposed this summer its not happened before
1766243 calculating your total climate damaging carbon emissions reducing them where possible and then balancing your remaining emissions often by purchasing a carbon offset paying to plant new trees or investing in green technologies such as solar and wind power
1766244 all of our investments in internal efficiencies have very positive returns with paybacks of less than three years
1766245 slash and burn agricultural pressures are clearing the forest there at an intense rate
1766246 solving our national energy crisis requires an all of the above approach
1766247 that will require aggressive development of alternative energies like wind solar tidal and bio fuels it also requires expanding traditional sources of energy like off shore drilling clean coal and nuclear power like the power produced at this plant here in michigan
1766248 ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico
1766249 los equipos est n en el derecho de pedir a sus jugadores que regresen a europa
1766250 no est incluido en el calendario coordinado de partidos internacionales y no hay una decisi n espec fica del comit ejecutivo de la fifa que establezca la obligaci n de los clubes de liberar a los jugadores menores de 23 a os para este torneo
1766251 se hizo mayormente sin diego y est tan avanzada que no tiene mucho sentido traerlo a esta altura
1766252 nos complace que el tas haya confirmado nuestra interpretaci n legal
1766253 aqu no hay vencedores porque se cre una situaci n imposible como resultado de la demora en resolver el asunto cinco minutos antes del inicio del torneo tenemos que decidir si traer de vuelta a un jugador o no
1766254 nuestra decisi n hubiera sido muy distinta si la posici n legal hubiera sido aclarada antes en ese caso
1766255 no hubi ramos permitido que rafinha viajase bajo ninguna circunstancia
1766256 la fifa est sorprendida y decepcionada por la decisi n pero la respetamos
1766257 no obstante les pido a los clubes dejen que sus jugadores participen en los juegos ol mpicos
1766258 ser a un acto solidario que armonizar a perfectamente con el esp ritu ol mpico ser a maravilloso tanto para los jugadores como para los aficionados y el propio deporte
1766259 las relaciones entre la fifa y los clubes no est n tan bien como deber an y parece que hubo una falta de clarificaci n por ambas partes ahora vamos a trabajar con la fifa para que las reglas ayuden a los atletas en un futuro a participar en los juegos ol mpicos
1766260 este es el momento de sentarse en la mesa y encontrar una soluci n razonable
1766261 no creo que sea en el inter s de nadie destruir el que podr a ser un torneo extraordinario este a o
1766262 la fifa y la confederaci n brasile a de f tbol estaban al tanto de la situaci n desde hace meses creo que demoraron deliberadamente su resoluci n para poner en una situaci n inc moda a los clubes

1766273 this excavators reduced tail swing and 360 degree rotation enable it to get into tight spaces
1766274 if youre a small contractor or landscaper who needs pinpoint metering for control yet a lot of production in a highly maneuverable fuel efficient package the 75d is a great unit
1766275 generous hydraulic flow and increased swing torque will help you load more trucks and open more trench
1766276 you would have to be crazy who would want to turn themselves in

1766284 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package
1766285 we agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran
1766286 given the absence of a clear positive response from iran the six countries are discussing next steps in the u n security council and beginning to consider the possible outlines of another resolution
1766287 with this offer we have emphasized that we are going to great lengths to achieve a diplomatic solution to the nuclear conflict
1766288 if iran continues to refuse to come to the negotiating table the international pressure on iran will only grow
1766289 the letter that we received yesterday appears to be a stalling tactic
1766290 the iranians have long stalled on responding to the allies
1766291 it looks like its going to be new york or tampa bay were waiting to find out and we could learn in the next hour or so
1766292 were trying to become a great one well do anything we can to get better and if that involves looking at other players by george thats our job thats our responsibility
1766293 for them to keep us in the dark and just have us answering a bunch of questions that we cant possibly have a good answer for i dont think its fair to us
1766294 i think there needs to be something said yea or nay for brett favre
1766295 we have an excellent opportunity here to be a very good football team in 2008
1766296 weve had an extraordinary challenge dealing with this situation a lot can be learned from it but they definitely want this thing resolved as soon as possible
1766297 when its in your face like this how do you avoid it how do you not allow it to be in the back of your head you cant
1766298 youre thinking about it everybodys in here thinking about it and we just dont know what the next moves going to be
1766299 the train has left the station whatever analogy you want
1766300 he needs to jump on the train and lets go or if we cant get past things that have happened i have to keep the train moving
1766301 we are very disappointed that iran has yet again failed to give javier solana a clear answer to the generous incentives package
1766302 we agreed that we have no choice but to pursue further measures against iran

1766309 law enforcement officials have been telling me that the fingerprint they have links rockefeller to chichester
1766310 he was stopped in greenwich connecticut driving a car registered to sohu police in greenwich notified the police department that they had this truck linked to a missing person from los angeles county but the case never went anywhere and chichester disappeared again
1766311 the way he dressed he would wear stuff like blue blazers and white pants it was like he had just fallen off a yacht and he talked i was telling my dad he was like another thurston howell iii from gilligans island
1766312 we saw a bulletin on morning news with several photos of a mr clark rockefeller the man we knew as chip

1766314 case is proudly leading the construction industry to help lower customers fuel costs and make a positive impact on the environment
1766315 using biodiesel to power case equipment reduces our dependence on foreign oil and increases our u s based energy production plus biodiesel has the potential to save customers money

1766321 any verdict resulting from such a flawed system is a betrayal of american values the rules for the guant namo military commissions are so flawed that justice could never be served from start to finish this has been a monumental debacle of american justice the judgment against hamdan undoubtedly will be challenged in legitimate courts but there is no appeal from the judgment of future generations this system was devised to permit the prosecution of alleged wrongdoing by detainees while continuing to cover up the wrongdoing by government interrogators trials that are shrouded in secrecy and tainted by coercion are the very antithesis of american justice
1766322 in the strange world of guant namo justice even if hamdan had been acquitted on all charges he would have been detained indefinitely nowhere else in the u s justice system can someone be held for life regardless of whether he is convicted or acquitted of a crime todays outcome represents nothing more than an illusion of justice it is time to shut down these commissions and put an end to this shameful chapter in american history

1766369 youths were throwing trolleys on the fire they then turned their attention on us and started throwing bricks at us and hurling abuse saying they would kill us we were forced to withdraw and called the police it is not the first time this has happened
1766370 any attack on a firefighter or any other member of the emergency services is a great cause of concern to us although the trend is down in oldham it is something we take very seriously we have regular area action team meetings and i shall flag this up next time we meet there is a pilot scheme currently going on in trafford where a volunteer similar to a pcso goes into areas that have these problems and talks to the youths
1766371 there can never be any excuse for attacks on firefighters as anything that prevents them from doing their work could mean the difference between life and death for those they are trying to help
1766372 we will prosecute those who attack firefighters and help create an environment where they can carry out their job without fear
1766373 weve tried to get the community involved in solving this problem because its their neighbourhood there are two things residents can do to help they can avoid leaving out rubbish or combustibles and calling the council if they see anything lying about so it can be removed but what id really like them to do is if they know who is starting these fires and abusing my officers to can pass that information to the police

1766377 we played with it last night and in the first try got it to go 100 metres
1766378 when we built it the first time around there was not enough power in it so we chopped it up and started all over again the crew came to film us doing a bit of the build after theyd filmed some of the other teams we were told they were only hitting 20 or 30 metres in their first go so its fingers crossed that were in with a good chance
1766379 its been a good laugh its just about a group of mates all with the same passion building something that youd never otherwise build in your life

1766396 we can regard idf as a simple version of the rsj weight applicable when we have no relevance information
1766397 we might be tempted to link this interpretation to the idf formula by regarding idf as measuring the amount of information carried by the term indeed something along these lines has been done several times including by the present author robertson 1974 some problems with this view of idf are discussed below
1766398 the essence of the problem is that it is hard to identify a single event space and probability measure within which all the relevant random variables can be defined without such a unifying event space any process that involves comparing and or mixing different measures even a process as simple as adding idfs for different terms may well be invalid in terms of a shannon like formalism
1766399 but there is a more serious problem when we search using weighted terms we typically take the query terms and assign weights to them but ignore all the other terms in the vocabulary it is hard to see how such a practice could make sense in a shannon like model every term in the document must be assumed to carry information as well as any other that is the presence of a term ti would carry log p ti amount of information irrespective of whether or not it is in the query there is nothing to link the amount of information to the specific query so we would have no justification for leaving it out of the calculation nevertheless the similarity of the usual idf formulation to a component of entropy has stimulated other researchers to try to make connections sometimes somewhat differently from the link suggested above

1766403 interestingly one could say that expecting people to change their behavior and start optimizing the air pressure in their tires is also ignorant assume that a certain percentage of the population is already doing this which initially takes away from the whole now of the remainder a lot dont care and wont change and many others dont have easy access to an air pump compressor and all of this assumes that everyones tires are not at an optimum pressure so while we could attain a 3 to 4 percent increase in mileage i would argue that when the rubber hits the road this is not a solution that garners much merit

1766514 california is a leader in promoting health and nutrition and i am pleased to continue that tradition by being the first state in the nation to phase out trans fats
1766515 trans fat is generally recognized as the single most harmful fat in the food supply on a gram per gram basis
1766516 were confident that our members can meet the mandate because many of them are already voluntarily phasing out the use of trans fats

1766519 really at the heart of my concern is that we shouldnt wait for a definitive study to come out but err on the side of being safe rather than sorry later
1766520 we found no overall increased risk of brain tumors among cellular phone users the potential elevated risk of brain tumors after long term cellular phone use awaits confirmation by future studies
1766521 if there is a risk from these products and at this point we do not know that there is it is probably very small
1766522 a lot of people dont know about medical malls and how well they have done
1766523 shopping centers are owned by retail folks they dont know about medical services and when they are looking to fill vacancies they think retail they have to cross the line
1766524 the lerners are willing to consider anything that will add to the development of that site
1766525 we would have space leased and the community would have an additional service

1766528 fortunately the hincapie sportswear performer chamois also has excellent air filtration qualities
1766529 i mean the air is filthy here im choking worse than i did at roubaix
1766530 so im just going to surreptitiously breathe through this delicious chipotle burrito the whole time im here as far as anybody can tell im just eating this way my lungs stay pink the chinese save face and my sponsor stays happy
1766531 unlike the track squad i did my homework and studied how beijing residents cope with the poor air quality apparently most of them breathe through small white paper cylinders filled with burning tobacco so thats what im doing and its working great i may actually keep this up when i return to the states
1766532 were not worried about the air so much as the water for the swim leg
1766533 the chinese apparently moved some factories in order to improve air quality for the games and according to google maps until about two weeks ago the place where well be swimming was a mercury plant well be wearing full radiation suits as a precaution
1766534 ill be breathing through the facemask of a fortynine sixteen outlaw hoodie as well as through the neck curtain of my own mullet
1766535 we can do better and were incredibly well placed to drive success in the region weve got to make sure we tailor our resource needs to the games we are making
1766536 were going to invest in more ways than we have before
1766537 were going to invest in this region to ensure we win
1766538 you never can push them as far as they can go the reality of the peak performance of the console is yes you could look to a generation beyond where we are now and think yeah i could use that power but the reality is in 360 and the ps3 and the latest generation pc graphics the amount of power in the gpus is such that youre more bound by your creativity and the aesthetic youre going for than youre really bound by polygon pushing power
1766539 youre probably actually more bound maybe by art authoring and the amount of data throughput that just the amount of memory youd need but i dont think 360 has reached its limit
1766540 isnt that supposed to be done only in times of war
1766541 this is part of the reason we signed coach cloutier he will be a great coach and we knew he would be a great recruiter reynolds is a huge pick up for us he played last year for the springfield falcons the equivalent of triple a hockey springfield is the affiliate for the edmonton oilers reynolds will add a great deal to our team
1766542 it is already getting easier to recruit players in corpus christi the word is spreading that there is a new ownership group committed to winning hockey and that will make my recruiting job much easier guys have always loved the lifestyle in corpus christi and now that there is a committed ownership group in place we will have a real shot at getting some great players t j reynolds is a player and fans in corpus christi will love watching this guy play
1766543 i am looking forward to playing in corpus christi i would play anywhere for coach cloutier but the fact that corpus christi is a great town with great new owners makes it an even easier choice i want to help bring winning back to corpus christi
1766544 wow this is just plain huge to get a quality player like tj reynolds added to the guys we have already signed is a great start for the new era in coastal bend hockey sylvain cloutier has already begun to make his mark once again pat dunns hiring of coach cloutier continues to look like a great decision based on his performance so far

1766550 ive been pretty unimpressed with the iocs efforts in protecting athletes for giving them any options
1766551 certainly the olympic games are about the athletes the active athletes who are competing
1766552 he is a normal citizen in this case and any citizen has to apply for a visa its a matter for the chinese government
1766553 visa application processes for any country are done by governments the ioc is not a sovereign government we cannot influence sovereign laws
1766554 but its between this government and joey as a private citizen
1766555 i dont begrudge them the olympics i think theyll do well with them
1766556 but there are so many of their governments policies that i find repulsive especially for athletes who have no intention but to help someone else
1766557 i dont see one single positive that tiger woods isnt on our team
1766558 i cant imagine how you can argue a team would be better off without potentially the greatest player who has ever lived certainly the greatest player of his era
1766559 as far as im concerned it really puts europe in an advantageous place it puts europe in a favorite role theres just no question about it
1766560 in the past when you looked at the teams on paper you could maybe say it would be close and it turned out the last two werent close at all but to argue that europe wouldnt be the favorite this time around would be very difficult

1766611 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1766612 apart from the odd speeding car buildings landscape and walls around us all move past us at slow and predictable speeds our brains are constantly building up a statistical picture of the world around and based on experience it is a statistically slow world
1766613 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1766614 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience

1766626 dulu tempat yang saya duduki ini adalah masjid masjid yang sangat ramai dan makmur meskipun tidak besar
1766627 ya aku ingat kau bukankah kau juga biasa mengaji di masjid ini dulu kau selalu diledek karena kopiahmu yang butut ha ha ha apakah kau ingat dengan ustadz yang dulu mengajarimu membaca al quran untuk pertama kali
1766628 tentu saja kau tidak akan mengingatnya karena mungkin kau hanya beberapa minggu saja diajarinya sebelum masjid ini digusur ustadz itu menghilang entah kemana kan
1766629 segelintir orang telah menghancurkan impiannya uang yang cukup besar tidak dipergunakan untuk membangun masjid yang besar dan indah hanya sebagian kecil saja mereka membelanjakannya untuk sebuah tempat yang kecil buruk sisanya mereka bagi rata ustadz itu berontak dan marah tapi kemudian dia diringkus oleh orang orang itu dan dibunuh mayatnya ditanam di bawah lantai masjid
1766630 tentu saja aku tahu karena akulah ustadz yang dibunuh itu nah sekarang lihat aku baik baik kau masih kenal aku kan
1766631 there has been no one down here but they are coming
1766632 we must go through the pool hold tightly to me fyodor and if you ever believed in the great king believe him now
1766633 this is the castle of the great king on the mountain djebel the great king has a special task for you
1766634 oh great king i present to you your humble servant fyodor
1766635 my servant i have been watching you you have been faithful to me despite having no water in your village you always believed though you did not see for this you are blessed you are the bearer of the cup of kings and you will also be the bearer of the king i must go to the castle drinas where battle rages for the fate of teshara fyodor will you bear me hence
1766636 it would be an honor to bear you to drinas
1766637 what is this what is happening in my kingdom that you come at each other with swords
1766638 your kingdom who are you to claim this kingdom this is my kingdom now i have brought my men here and we have brought these simple people to shame we will rule them now
1766639 who am i i am one who knows who you are king morscen
1766640 morscen what have you done to my people you have turned my own servants the hoshbelim against me you come against your brothers in war you threaten and kill and for what for my throne do you think that you will achieve my throne by force never a deep wisdom guards this kingdom that will never allow the rule to be placed in such hands as yours
1766641 it has been rumored that the cup of kings was found and this is true my time has come i am old and no longer can come among my people i must pass on my wisdom my years have been seven hundred and seventy seven and the next who will receive the deep wisdom will live as long as did each great king before me
1766642 into it has been poured the wisdom of the ages the inscription on it reads thus na le ili chala hna lavotha mael saweda hna lavotha which means he who bears this cup bears great wisdom it is given by the most innocent of all men to the most wise of all men
1766643 fyodor my innocent son to whom have you granted this cup
1766644 my king i gave this cup to the master crispin for i sensed in him great character
1766645 i have watched you long crispin i have spoken to you silently as you sat by the waters of the sacred pool
1766646 i have been watching you as well your time will come when you will rule the drinadi you have much to learn but you are learning already
1766647 i saw you in the castle playing in the tunnels when you were just a child i knew that you had the spirit needed by a queen i sent you on this journey my child to teach you many things when you were attacked by the wolves you became brave
1766648 when cether told you that i did not exist you truly believed in me when fyodor gave crispin the cup you began to respect the common man and when cether sold you you realized your need for other people i watched as the maid taught you how to make a bed and i saw that you learned just how much you never knew and when you returned to help her bring the sheets to the scullery my heart thrilled
1766649 you learned to serve as you laid your hands on wounded men
1766650 just remember who you serve my daughter the great king and then your people
1766651 i dont know but hurry up glarind just opened a new cask of wine and i want some before it is all gone
1766652 then put him in the next cell just hurry up
1766653 but dont eat it all now we arent coming back until that cask is gone
1766654 it is why i am here i think i took in some strangers and the morscendi came to my door and nearly broke it down they wanted the strangers and they said that the strangers carried something which would make the morscendi the rulers over teshara instead of the great king i told them i would never betray the great king and they brought me here
1766655 are you willing to serve the great king or does your fear stop you
1766656 how is it serving the great king to give you my water
1766657 i am na ina of the hosbelim i am an interpreter fyodor do you know the stories of the water
1766658 this is the story at the beginning of time when the first great king ruled teshara he chose one people to be his servants and his messengers
1766659 i am an interpreter fyodor i have been given a special gift to speak to the great king in the water the morscendi know this so they have withheld water from me for they know that i gain strength from communing with the great king but they made one mistake they let me see the water and the great king told me that his time has come he must pass on his kingship to the next great king and we fyodor you and i are to play a part so if you truly serve the great king please give me a drink of water for i can speak to the great king even through the water in that cup and regain my strength
1766660 the guards are at their wine let us go now before they come back we must go to the sacred pool
1766661 fyodor i have one task which i must accomplish alone i will leave you here for a moment but i will come back for you do not let yourself be seen
1766662 we will have to be careful but perhaps we can travel under the sand
1766663 the sacred pool of the bainidi we are close to the castle
1766664 daughter you are dirty and worn go into the water and be refreshed
1766665 please miss i do not know what you mean i serve the great king but i am nothing myself
1766666 you were nothing but the great king has been watching you you are blessed of him
1766667 and you ilistair of the drinadi the great king has been watching you as well what you plan to do do quickly but be assured you have no part in the great king
1766668 my love if you hope to be queen you must be commoner first
1766669 i must go quickly i have left a servant of the great king in grave danger peace be with you
1766670 she called you ilistair of the drinadi is that your name
1766671 do you think i have led you here for nothing no you are a fool we were steps from the castle pala but i knew you were too weak to challenge me i brought you here for my own purposes to sell you as slaves a princess should fetch a high price and such an obedient dog as you will go quickly as well
1766672 i have to part in drinas and i do not care what happens to your father
1766673 i am your brother ilistair but i no longer have a part in the castle you see i learned the truth all those times that father took me into the village i learned from the commoners the truth there is no great king he is just a ruse to keep the people silent while tyrants such as your father oppress them i joined the revolt against the great king and that was when your father banished me from the castle so i came out here earning money in the slave trade while biding my time waiting for the cup when i find it i will rule and you will see what happens to your father then

1766675 india takes part only in un approved sanctioned military operations and the un has not mandated this action in afghanistan so there is no question of india participating in it

1766677 the blasts at indian embassy in kabul shows that unless and until support to taliban stops from outside the us led coalition forces are going to stay there for longer period

1766695 as many people may know former governor michael dukakis has always been a big proponent of public transportation
1766696 the last thing in the world we need at this point in time is a fare increase
1766697 all it will do is drive people away from the system at a time when we want more people and not fewer riding it

1766700 go on without me jen finish your quest youve trained long and hard for this
1766701 avere costituito un sistema di comunicazioni telefoniche riservate intrattenute tra il moggi e il fabiani da una parte e gli associati aia
1766702 sono assolutamente inconferenti i rilievi mossi dalle difese degli incolpati in ordine alla mancanza di prova di accordi illeciti raggiunti attraverso le comunicazioni telefoniche operate con le schede telefoniche estere se ci fosse stata prova di accordi illeciti ben altra sarebbe stata la contestazione rivolta ai deferiti e evidente che lutilizzo di schede telefoniche anonime e straniere era finalizzato ad eludere la possibilit di risalire ai titolari delle schede e ad impedire possibili intercettazioni tale obiettivo risulta ancora pi censurabile considerato il ruolo ricoperto dagli arbitri che impone loro di tenere una condotta assolutamente leale e trasparente
1766703 a tough guy from the boston area who uses no other weapon but a baseball bat
1766704 the flesh is sad alas and i have read all the books
1766705 when were the good and brave ever in a majority
1766706 flip flops are not the best shoes for walking study finds
1766707 of course sir the bainidi would never deny a traveler hospitality
1766708 please i must see the king i have urgent news
1766709 sir i cannot take you to the king no commoner can simply enter the kings presence and speak to him
1766710 well i must attend to my duties and you should be glad i did because otherwise i would not have heard your knock
1766711 a castle needs faithful servants to do their duty but i think you should be rewarded
1766712 great lords and ladies i am terribly sorry to interrupt your celebration but i must speak to the king
1766713 and what makes you think your message is so important that you can interrupt the kings very own birthday
1766714 sir i bear dire news from the far off kingdom of drinas
1766715 perhaps you care nothing for drinas but what of the great king
1766716 the great king would want you to lend aid to your neighbors
1766717 he gave it to me because he said i was a man of character
1766718 then you do not know and i will not tell you but i know you are a servant of the great king and if the great king has sent you then we will go to the aid of the drinas
1766719 there is one more request i must make of you i traveled here with the princess of the drinadi aletha we were led astray by a slave trader who called himself a cetherim cether has sold aletha to someone in this castle and i must find her
1766720 a slave trader has had business here find the girl at once and bring to me the one who has indulged himself in the slave trade as well as the trader which this man speaks of
1766721 i am a princess my nurse always made my bed
1766722 well you aint a princess no more you best learn how to make a bed and scald sheets for that matter come along ill show you once but mind you remember or youll get a whipping next time
1766723 it seems weve a great deal of work to do in teaching her how to do anything
1766724 her though im not sure you could quite call her a servant
1766725 thank you crispin i have been so unkind to you and yet you have saved me
1766726 princess we are setting a plan to go back to drinas and save your people crispin will be coming with us but i do not know if you would be fit for the journey
1766727 please let me go i will do whatever you need i will go with the medical tent i can at least help the physician unroll bandages
1766728 you will be in battle my lady it is not safe
1766729 all right you may go but stay close to the physician
1766730 we will be taking the camels for they are the fastest let us depart
1766731 camels cannot be directed when they are running fast i have told him where to go so you will probably find the right place
1766732 you dont want to wake her its obviously the princess chamber look at all these trappings and trinkets
1766733 yes a beautiful girl by their standards curly blond hair and blue eyes
1766734 miss if you please i would rather not play games
1766735 listen crispin i dreamed that morscendi were in my room and when i woke up i saw the rug was moved they are here dont you see
1766736 no i know these tunnels there is an exit to the right
1766737 you knew this tunnel was blocked didnt you thats why you said to go the other way
1766738 what are you doing this is no time to play we must warn my father
1766739 we cannot go back in the castle we must go to the castle pala where we can get help
1766740 we must keep moving princess there are other dangers in the forest
1766741 the castle pala it should be close because both our castle and theirs lies at the edge of our countries we will reach it tomorrow if not tonight
1766742 youre just a commoner you dont know anything about castles
1766743 it is not wise for ones so young as you to be in the forest alone at night
1766744 we had not hoped to be in the forest at night
1766745 yes our castle was attacked and we were forced to flee
1766746 have no fear young man it is my duty to aid travelers on these roads i am one of the cetherim
1766747 i have longed to meet one such as you tell me great sir what is your name
1766748 my name is my own son you can call me by my work cether
1766749 i am the princess aletha and this is my companion crispin we are from the castle bain
1766750 dont tell this man who you are we do not know if we can trust him
1766751 you are wise as well as brave my son but you have nothing to fear from me i could see her status by her clothing i promise you it is my only goal to help travelers safely through the forests now if you tell me your business i can help you
1766752 we are from the castle drinas our castle was attacked by the morscendi and we were fleeing to the castle pala for help we were forced to flee at night and for that reason we were in the forest in the dark
1766753 that is miles to the south and the east the castle bain is much closer
1766754 he is only a commoner perhaps he did not know
1766755 we will go to the castle bain i am no commoner you can trust me when i say the castle bain is much closer
1766756 as you have told me already do you not know where it was found and by whom
1766757 the water is difficult to discern my lord i see nothing because of the ripples
1766758 can you not call the interpreter perhaps this news of the cup will bring her to speak
1766759 no my lord i do not want her to know what we have found
1766760 do not think holy one that you will escape my wrath just because of your position anyone
1766761 who keeps me from that cup will feel my wrath
1766762 fool we know you can escape us in the water you must look at it and read it bring her to the water
1766763 then bring her back and give her no food when she comes around her hunger will drive her to speak before long
1766764 feed her well i want her to be alive and well when i come back with the cup and kill her in front of it
1766765 go into the water if you cannot tell me what you see then you will join her in her fate
1766766 i do see something the images flash by so quickly there is a king he is old the cup it gleams and a castle the castle of the drinas the rolling hills i think a battle swift riders a girl running wait there is king eldrin the cup again it gleams
1766767 if only i could have reached it just dipped a finger in it it would have been enough
1766768 the water so that the king can speak to the great king miss
1766769 princess no one is allowed to see it without the interpreter
1766770 if you will not come to us then i will come to you
1766771 dont touch the water princess i know it is tempting but it is dangerous as well since there is no interpreter here
1766772 dont worry yourself lord paegril i have no interest in the water i am only looking at the paintings
1766773 aletha what have you been doing you are pale and your legs are shaking
1766774 nothing miss leona i was practicing fencing with fathers sword i came in here because i saw that boy who brings the water to father come in here and i was following him
1766775 you shouldnt play games princess it is not befitting your status especially games such as fencing and not only that you shouldnt be associating with commoners such as that boy you are a princess and you must act like one
1766776 well your father means respect in a different way not associate with speaking of your father he has asked that you join him for dinner this evening and i have come to make you ready
1766777 a young boy and a girl were sitting here by the pool they ran and escaped through a trapdoor our guards saw them escape into the forest but did not follow them
1766778 it seems the boy was a servant but the girl was not
1766779 let them go chances are they will not make it out of the woods alive and if they do the girl will slow them so much they will not reach help in time we need our men here
1766780 when we hear the signal from above then we attack from below
1766781 when did the cetherim became part of the history of teshara
1766782 teshara is the name of the whole country crispin i dont know how much commoners know about the histories
1766783 do they still teach that nonsense about the great king
1766784 i know all about the great king how he was the wisest man when the earth was made how he reigned in wisdom how
1766785 how he put all his wisdom into a cup which is passed down at his death to the next great king but tell me dont the histories say that he lived on the highest mountain that all could see if that is true where is the mountain
1766786 it was covered by the clouds when the people of the earth began to turn away from him
1766787 it is a cheap trick to keep children from asking questions if there ever was a great king he has left us
1766788 father says that if he is distant it is not because he left us but because we left him
1766789 do commoners such as yourself believe in the great king
1766790 no one can speak to the great king except the interpreters no human can read the water anymore
1766791 i dont know about that princess as you said i am just a commoner all i know is that i sit by the sacred pool and sometimes i can see his face in the water and he speaks to me
1766792 there it is the city of badire that is the last stop before the desert
1766793 king morscen we have captured the drinadi king he is being held in his own great hall
1766794 we had to club him in order to capture him
1766795 you know very well what i am talking about where is the cup
1766796 the cup of kings the water tells us that you have it
1766797 you are a fool if you think you can hide it from me tell me where it is
1766798 you are a fool if you think that little brat will escape the clutches of the morscendi
1766799 send your swiftest riders after the girl and bring her back
1766800 i would like her and her father to share the same fate
1766801 and if you really plan to journey into the desert you must stop at my house for rest and refreshment before you go
1766802 now if you are not from these parts you probably will not want hot tea on a hot day but take it from someone who has lived here a long time it helps you to cool down you see
1766803 it makes you so hot inside that the sun feels not so hot
1766804 i do not know where it came from but it seems to be of great value
1766805 you say you do not know where it came from no one gave it to you
1766806 i was cleaning out my cupboards when i found it
1766807 you should never touch such a thing a commoner such as yourself has no right to such beauty
1766808 i am a commoner my lady do i also have no right to it
1766809 if finding it gives me the right to own it then it also gives me the right to give it away crispin i believe you do have a right to such beauty and i am giving you this cup
1766810 no sir i wouldnt take such a precious thing from you
1766811 you are not taking it from me i want to give it to you if i did not want to i would not do it i can see that you are a man of great character and though your status may not grant you such beauty your character does take it
1766812 sir i serve the great king only i will not aid in you in overthrowing him
1766813 they have taken fyodor we must flee into the desert
1766814 our friend it seems has not betrayed us but we must move quickly for they will return soon
1766815 a sandstorm very few can live through such a sandstorm
1766816 they have begun to pursue us but they will turn back because of the sand we must press on
1766817 wrap these turbans around your faces they will help to keep the dust out of your eyes and nose and mouth we will try to find somewhere to hide
1766818 cether i dont think that it is a good idea to stay here
1766819 well so much for staying away from caves we must be very careful for larger animals inhabit larger caves
1766820 i pulled you up princess you are my future queen i could not let you fall

1767012 lucy is fighting for the freedom and democracy of tibet and is doing what she feels is right and what i feel is right obviously im worried any parent would be but i am certain that china would not resort to torture or abuse when the eyes of the world are upon them
1767013 we did this action today to highlight the chinese governments use of the beijing olympics as a propaganda tool they are whitewashing their human rights record on tibet so our action today shines a spotlight on those atrocities in march tibetans took to the streets risking everything in their calls for justice and human rights and we stand today with this action in solidarity with those calls

1767032 so weve gone from maybe one fifth or one sixth of the worlds population participating to where we now have a huge pool of people in the olympic games
1767033 at some level weve reached a physiological plateau in general the champions of today dont have dramatically better treadmill times as compared to elite athletes of earlier generations what i think we are seeing is a small effect due to better racetracks shoes and improved sports medicine and people are participating longer so you have more competitive depth which leads to better races and races designed to set world records
1767034 the lactate threshold is highly related to how people perform in an event like the 10 000 meter race marathons or a bicycle time trial the physiology and biochemistry behind it is complex and controversial but its a good marker of when the regulatory and physiological control systems of the body are in balance
1767035 the first misperception is that somehow people dont have enough oxygen when they are making lactic acid that certainly can be true because lactic acid can come from a lack of oxygen but under most circumstances the athletes have plenty of oxygen and there is plenty of oxygen in the muscle
1767036 the second misnomer is that lactic acid hangs around in your muscle for long periods of time you may hear things like this individual is sore or not performing as well today because they have a lot of lactic acid in their muscle from yesterdays event well you can have very high levels of lactic acid in muscle but its gone 15 to 30 minutes after exercise so lactic acid doesnt hang around a long time
1767037 breathing oxygen on the sidelines really doesnt help theres no evidence that it works
1767038 they all have big engines and high lactate thresholds because theyve been training hard for a long time their muscles have adapted to run very fast without releasing a lot of lactic acid
1767039 in cycling for example when lance armstrong came back from cancer he became much more efficient he could generate more power per given oxygen update that is the same as a runner being able to generate more speed per given power when you look at this small pool of elite athletes of runners cyclists and rowers all of them have a high vo2 all have a large engine and all of them have skeletal muscles that are designed not to produce a lot of lactic acid so the question then becomes who is the most efficient
1767040 your vo2 max typically starts to decline in your 30s but a highly trained athlete can delay that decline until they are in their later 30s or even early 40s an average sedentary person loses about 10 percent per decade starting at about age 30 but for someone who is able to continue to train very hard into their 40s and 50s they only lose about half that much primarily due to the fact they continue to train hard
1767041 as scientists search for genes and the determinants of performance they keep drawing a blank there have been no major gene discoveries saying that this gene really confers championship status or the potential for championship status of one person
1767042 it can be very deceptive to say that since the kenyans and perhaps ethiopians are dominating distance running it must be genetic in fact there have been periods of time when other cultures have dominated distance running before world war ii the finns dominated distance running after world war ii the eastern europeans dominated distance running they were just as dominant as the kenyans are now
1767043 i think what the kenyans and ethiopians have shown is the value of altitude training they are physically active their entire lives they live at high altitude they run to and from school they play soccer after school all at high altitude 6 000 to 8 000 feet there are not a lot of economic opportunities so there is a tremendous incentive for people to run and train hard
1767044 so what the kenyans have added is altitude training hard training and large numbers of highly motivated people but their physiological data is not dramatically different from other people i think you can make the same argument for the eastern europeans after world war ii if you were a pretty good athlete the government offered you and your family incentives to train in an otherwise bleak economic landscape
1767045 one of the sad things in last 30 to 40 years of sport has been the emergence of the pharmacological arms race or doping
1767046 researchers have started to test the tests and have raised questions about the accuracy of the existing tests theyve shown that if you dont do the test soon after people take the drug it may be very difficult to detect especially if epo is take in low doses
1767047 remember while its fun to watch sports and while we will all be tempted to sit in front of the tv to watch the olympics the really important thing is to get out and move one hundred and fifty minutes of physical activity a week is really the most powerful medicine anybody can prescribe no matter what your level of fitness even if its just walking try to be as physically active as you possibly can because thats the way to be a healthy old person and get more out of life
1767048 those who turn to allaah in repentance that serve him and praise him that wander in devotion to the cause of allaah that bow down and prostrate themselves in prayer that enjoin good and forbid evil and observe the limits set by allaah so proclaim the glad tidings to the believers
1767049 none of you truly believes until he loves for his brother what he loves for himself
1767050 by allaah he does not believe by allaah he does not believe by allaah he does not believe
1767051 it is to be full of modesty and to be harmless too to be full of goodness and not to be corrupt for the tongue to be truthful for the words to be little and to be plentiful in good action to have little slip ups and not to be excessive to be good to ones relatives building closeness between them to be dignified and grateful to be full of contentment if allaah restricted some provision to be forbearing and friendly to his brothers to be compassionate and chaste not to curse swear insult backbite nor to gossip not to be hasty envious hateful arrogant nor vain not to lean towards worldliness nor to extend long hopes and wishes not to sleep too much nor to be absent minded nor to show off nor be hypocritical not to be selfish but to be soft and cheerful not servile loving for the sake of allaah being pleased for his sake and being angry only for his sake his provision is taqwaa reverential fear of allaah his worries are what will happen to him in the afterlife his friends remind him his beloved is his protector and master his struggle is for the afterlife
1767052 a believer plants a palm tree and fears that thorns will grow the hypocrites plant thorns expecting ripe dates to grow
1767053 o allah show us the tuth as truth amp give us the ability to follow it amp show us the falsehood as falsehood amp give us the ability to avoid it
1767054 the map is the most precise depiction yet of the limits and the future dividing lines that could be drawn across the arctic region
1767055 the results have huge implications for policy making as the rush to carve up the polar region continues
1767056 its a cartographic means of showing and an attempt to collate information and predict the way in which the arctic region may eventually be divided up the freezing land and seas of the arctic are likely to be getting hotter in terms of geopolitics the durham map aims to assist national and international policy makers across the world
1767057 although the precise mechanisms are currently under investigation the association between short sleep duration and overweight may be attributed to the interaction of behavioral and biological changes as a result of sleep deprivation
1767058 given the fact that the prevalence of overweight among children and adolescents continues to increase and chronic sleep insufficiency becomes more prevalent in modern society family and school based sleep interventions that aim to enhance sleep hygiene and increase sleep duration may have important public health implications for the prevention and intervention of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children
1767059 furthermore our results demonstrate an important relationship between rem sleep and high bmi and obesity suggesting that the short sleep obesity association may be attributed to reduced rem sleep time and decreased activity during rem sleep
1767060 we may think we live in a fast moving hectic world but statistically our environment moves around us slowly
1767061 when an object moves quickly be it a football cricket ball or for our ancestors a spear our brains have to interpret the movement rapidly and because our brains draw on experience its often biased by what it already knows the less certain we are about what we see the more we are influenced by the brains statistical assumptions which means in some circumstances we get it wrong
1767062 although it is not surprising that sportsmen who practice a lot build up a better statistical picture in their minds about where a ball might go it is surprising that what should be a vital survival skill is based on such a trial and error learning experience
1767063 the research also has important long term application to robotics and assistive technologies capitalising on natures design is a good way of building artificial visual systems for robots as humans get visual judgments right a lot more often than the best current robot systems further knowing the situations in which humans get it wrong is a useful starting point for the design of assistive devices to help correct those errors before they have serious consequences
1767064 because of a dramatic increase in the prevalence of childhood obesity and diabetes mellitus during the past two decades physical activity has assumed an increasingly prominent role in disease prevention and health promotion efforts in the united states and is considered one of the 10 leading health indicators for the nation
1767065 it is important to know how patterns of physical activity inactivity and sedentary behaviors for this increasing segment of the population differ from those of the majority native population
1767066 physical inactivity and sedentary behaviors varied widely among children in various ethnic immigrant groups
1767067 for example 22 5 percent of immigrant hispanic children were physically inactive compared with 9 5 percent of u s born white children with u s born parents
1767068 they were however less likely to watch television three or more hours per day than native children although the nativity gap narrowed with increasing acculturation levels
1767069 given the health benefits of physical activity continued higher physical inactivity and lower activity levels in immigrant children are likely to reduce their overall health advantage over u s born populations during adulthood
1767070 to reduce disparities in childhood physical activity health education programs designed to promote physical activity should target not only children from socially disadvantaged households and neighborhoods but also children in immigrant families
1767071 but in the long term im concerned about conferring resistance if youre talking about resistance on a broad scale it could jeopardize future treatment for mothers and infants
1767072 it reinforces the need to treat these women with combination therapy thereby providing better prevention for the infant while providing better treatment for the mother
1767073 public health efforts should continue to expand combination therapy so that mothers and babies arent left vulnerable to drug resistance

1767110 the inability of the government to furnish fresh evidence to the delhi high court tribunal raises serious doubts about the intent of the government to fight terror in such pressing times
1767111 the government did not produce strong evidence against the simi deliberately moving the supreme court after the decision of the tribunal is a course correction the way it happened with ram sethu just after the trust vote
1767112 all the evidence produced before the tribunal on simi activities were of 2001 simi activities have multiplied post 2001
1767113 on april 23 2008 minister of state for home sriprakash jaiswal had given a statement in the lok sabha whereby he accepted that simi has links with let and more than 75 000 activists were arrested for their involvement in anti national activities
1767114 a key step in the durable control of hiv infection requires enhancing the development of memory immune responses and the stimulation of potent cytotoxic t cells through therapeutic vaccination
1767115 working with our colleagues at the universit de montr al we have shown that argos approach of transfecting dendritic cells with autologous hiv specific antigens effectively activates dendritic cells and enhances the hiv specific t cell response we believe that these results support our methods of developing potent immunotherapies that help patients immune systems more effectively fight hiv infection
1767116 we believe that this improvement may represent a significant step forward
1767117 the fact that we can stimulate a specific long term immune response gives us great hope that with additional development we will be able to give people infected with hiv a new option to battle the virus
1767118 the co transfection of monocyte derived dendritic cells dc by different combinations of hiv antigen rna and molecular adjuvant rna enhanced the response of hiv specific cd8 t cells

1767122 nicotine interacts with a variety of neurochemical pathways within the brain to produce its rewarding and addictive effects
1767123 however during the early phase of tobacco exposure many individuals find nicotine highly unpleasant and aversive whereas others may become rapidly dependent on nicotine and find it highly rewarding we wanted to explore that difference
1767124 while much progress has been made in understanding how the brain processes the rewarding effects of nicotine after the dependence is established very little is known about how the mesolimbic dopamine system may control the initial vulnerability to nicotine that is why do some individuals become quickly addicted to nicotine while others do not and in some cases even find nicotine to be highly aversive
1767125 importantly our findings may explain an individuals vulnerability to nicotine addiction and may point to new pharmacological treatments for the prevention of it and the treatment of nicotine withdrawal
1767126 with the growing support and acknowledgment from companies like this it further promotes our mission and goal of one day being foam free in landfills
1767127 cal polys standing in this study tracks with what we are hearing from our alumni

1767134 it is clear to us tomatoes do not explain all of the clusters do not explain all of the cases and jalape o peppers themselves also do not explain all the clusters and all the cases
1767135 we have said for some time now that there were not tomatoes in the marketplace from areas that were shipping at the start of the outbreak
1767136 we encourage cdc and fda to complete their investigation of peppers quickly so that either the problem can be identified or if not these products can be cleared as well
1767137 the pace of the trace back process has been frustratingly slow and as a result the entire industry has suffered significantly for an outbreak it did not cause

1767158 our national economy is continuing to pose enormous challenges for our working families
1767159 we cannot afford to wait for help from washington or for the situation to grow worse

1767164 in addition that bridge work will demand enough steel to build four eiffel towers
1767165 we can lead the way out of the national economic crisis by continuing to invest in jobs and business expansion a safe infrastructure strong communities and the resulting gains in productivity

1767167 harris has a strong record of accomplishments with employ illinois sba lending programs and a long standing commitment to serving the small business community we look forward to providing even greater value through this program helping small businesses grow via low interest rate loans
1767168 small businesses play an enormous role in the states economy and in the health and wealth of local communities
1767169 we hope by combining forces with harris and the sba that we can help more entrepreneurs start and expand their companies and create new living wage jobs in illinois
1767170 there are many ongoing programs and initiatives in the chicago area aimed at assisting small businesses

1767172 this industry is noted for its well schooled contractors on the how to install flooring and wall systems but what they havent been taught is how to target find and sell to the actual customers much less handle the back office work that goes with this business

1767354 we are excited to establish a renewable power source for our own use as well as for the state of connecticut
1767355 to date this is our largest capital investment in our continuing effort to be a more environmentally friendly corporate citizen in the communities we serve throughout new england new york and new jersey we have undertaken lighting and energy efficiency projects at our facilities throughout the northeast and instituted no idle policies and continue to research and experiment with biodiesel and other fuel additives for our truck fleet we believe that these efforts not only benefit our business but are also simply the right and responsible thing to do
1767356 crystal rock is a leader in positive environmental action and connecticut is one of the most forward thinking states in regard to encouraging investment in solar and other alternative energies
1767357 the connecticut clean energy fund has helped to create a very positive environment for companies seeking to simultaneously enhance their business advantage lower dependence on external energy sources and act in an environmentally conscious manner we look forward to working with them on future projects
1767358 crystal rock has taken a significant step in weaning their operations from dependence on grid power not only will they be able to reduce their energy costs but they will also enjoy a healthy return on investment with significant benefits in the future as these systems have a life expectancy of 25 years or more

1767435 when we realized wed stayed on the summit too late in the morning and were hiking down the emmons glacier melting in the noon day sun we worked as a team to get off the mountain as fast as possible and in one piece

1767455 we found that there was no difference between the circumcised men and uncircumcised men that there is no increase in sexual dysfunction in circumcised men and in fact circumcised men did report greater penile sensitivity after circumcision
1767456 this is a call to action to call for male circumcision its been two years and still there is not enough money focus to scale up effort and more needs to be done
1767457 there is no national male circumcision campaign to promote it more education is needed
1767458 the long term care insurance industry paid out 3 5 billion in benefits to individuals last year
1767459 the risk of needing long term care is higher than the risk of a serious car accident or house fire but few people are aware of how many individuals and families already benefit from having purchased long term care insurance
1767460 some 400 000 new policies were issued last year alone as more individuals become aware of and understand the importance of planning for long term care needs the number of individuals and families deriving benefit from this coverage will only increase

1767464 one in eight persons age 65 and over has alzheimers

1767467 more than 70 percent of nursing home residents are women and almost two thirds of formal paid home care users and informal unpaid care recipients are women
1767468 some of the largest open claims those still being paid ranged from more than 500 000 to just over 1 million with the claimants having received benefits for between 7 and 13 years

1767574 new parents are told of the importance of babies sleeping on their backs to avoid sids but they are not always informed about the importance of tummy time
1767575 ideally babies should be placed on their tummies after every nap diaper change and feeding starting with 1 2 minutes
1767576 since the early 1990s we have seen a significant decrease in sids cases while simultaneously witnessing an alarming increase in skull deformation
1767577 increasing the amount of time your baby lies on his or her tummy promotes muscle development in the neck and shoulders helps prevent tight neck muscles and the development of flat areas on the back of the babys head and helps build the muscles baby needs to roll sit and crawl
1767578 its important to get our infants out of devices that constrain mobility and onto their tummies so they can focus on neck muscle balance as they interact with their caregivers

1767762 i think were going to get a bigger than expected corn yield coming in the next usda report and probably get a smaller than expected soybean yield estimate

1767769 protecting americas freedoms at home and abroad securing our homeland and defending democracy worldwide
1767770 i am a guardian of freedom and the american way of life
1767771 this phrase defines the honesty and dedication of the marines for their work of protecting the u s a
1767772 men and women to join their organization who are ready to fight for their country and protect their people
1767773 those who have gone before me to defend freedom and democracy around the world
1767774 the military protects your freedom from those who would take it
1767775 i disagree more and more of my freedoms are disappearing through actions initiated by the government that claims to represent me
1767776 i stay very well informed on such matters and i agree many areas of the government have overstepped their constitutional authority and damaged or taken some of your freedoms however the military did not take those illegal actions other areas of the government did
1767777 agreed but earlier you claimed unequivocally that the military protects my freedom you have agreed with my assertion that my freedoms are quickly disappearing therefore i can conclude that the military despite their claims to the contrary is not protecting my freedom the military may not have the authority to counter other rogue elements of the government that threaten my freedom but that fact is irrelevant what is relevant is the fact that my freedom is not being protected and you claim the military is protecting my freedom im not so much upset that the military cant through legal restrictions defend my freedom as i am that they claim they do protect my freedom when the military claims to protect my freedom they do so without listing any qualifiers or exceptions therefore the military and its supporters are promoting a lie
1767778 the military protects and defends the us constitution in obedience to its members pledge to defend it
1767779 i disagree many areas of the government have damaged taken and continue to threaten my liberties guaranteed under the us constitution you have previously agreed to this claim but the military makes no effort to protect or rectify these abuses it cannot do so because it lacks the legal authority to interfere in the activities of other areas of the government yet the military claims it does protect the us constitution and therefore protects the individuals safeguarded by that document amp 183 clearly as these examples prove the military does not and can not the military is telling a lie
1767780 in addition the military continues to execute acts of war against other states without the declaration of defending the constitution at the same time it is actively violating it the military may be excused for not having the authority to question or refuse participation in such illegal actions it is in effect impotent but by not having this authority to refuse participation it is clearly unable to take steps that would stop such an action the military claims to defend the constitution without offering any qualifiers or exceptions therefore this unequivocal categorical claim is a lie
1767781 the military protects your freedom when it is legally allowed to do so
1767782 ive wrapped everyone in the plane in white gauze then wrapped the entire plane in white gauze so im done
1767783 at this juncture the impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the problems in the subprime market seems likely to be contained
1767784 we will follow developments in the subprime market closely however fundamental factors including solid growth in incomes and relatively low mortgage rates should ultimately support the demand for housing and at this point the troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system
1767785 it is not the responsibility of the federal reserve nor would it be appropriate to protect lenders and investors from the consequences of their financial decisions but developments in financial markets can have broad economic effects felt by many outside the markets and the federal reserve must take those effects into account when determining policy
1767786 weve got strong financial institutions our markets are the envy of the world theyre resilient theyre innovative theyre flexible i think we move very quickly to address situations in this country and as i said our financial institutions are strong
1767787 in one way im sympathetic to the institutional reluctance to face the music id give a lot to mark my weight to model rather than to market
1767788 today i can say that we will not need additional funds these problems are behind us we will not return to the market
1767789 we deliberately raised more capital than we lost last year we believe that will allow us to not have to go back to the equity market in the foreseeable future
1767790 right now we believe that we are in a very comfortable spot in terms of our capital
1767791 less than five and half cents on the dollar thats an even cheaper sale than originally advertised what this transaction actually accomplishes is getting the paper but not the full liability off of merrills books how very enron like
1767792 lenders would have to curtail loans by roughly 10 to one to preserve their capital ratios this would imply a further contraction of credit by up to 12 trillion worldwide unless banks could raise fresh capital
1767793 you think you can lie and get away with it
1767794 maybe you can at the cato institute but not here on hnn
1767795 does the cato institute endorse it the book he asked in disbelief bully boy have written to solicit such a reaction
1767796 the more violence was involved in the emancipation process the worse the outcomes were making a provocative case for peaceful antislavery strategies
1767797 were to inspire abolitionists in the united states and abroad and they helped change history
1767798 an estimated 50 000 slaves were also brought into the u s between 1807 and 1860
1767799 republicans promoted government spending schemes that resulted in skyrocketing taxes
1767800 tax rates in the region in 1870 were three or four times what they had been in 1860
1767801 although the war brought the end of chattel slavery the resulting death and destruction intensified the determination of former slaveholders and their allies to suppress blacks
1767802 the military strategy for abolishing slavery was no short cut
1767803 the idea that the federal government would protect blacks was an illusion because they were a minority and a minority isnt likely to control government in a democracy
1767804 some people have objected that the united states couldnt have bought the freedom of all the slaves because this would have cost too much but buying the freedom of slaves was not more expensive than war nothing is more costly than war the costs include people killed or disabled destroyed property high taxes inflation military expenditures shortages war related famines and epidemics the billions of dollars of union military expenditures during the civil war would have been better spent reducing the number of slaveholders and slaves accelerating progress toward total emancipation
1767805 s lavery was being eroded throughout the west by political trends and relentless agitation the process would have continued and perhaps accelerated without the civil war
1767806 there would have come a time much sooner than most people might expect when the combined effects of multiple antislavery strategies would have brought about the fairly peaceful collapse of confederate slavery if this seems doubtful just recall how a combination of pressures led the mighty soviet union to collapse and vanish from the map without a nuclear war
1767807 my husband went to the shed the lock was broken and the gas cans werent there he was going to mow the grass and he made a police report
1767808 she didnt want him to know the gas cans were there she thought she could put them back and leave him a note of apology
1767809 casey has spoken she has spoken they dont want to listen and i cant go into more of that because again that is part of the investigation
1767810 im a lowkey person and i just want to make some tunes nothing else
1767811 the city and i have been in discussions for over a year about the best time to step aside

1767821 they need that interaction with their peers that has been lost there is a lot of fighting now
1767822 hemos venido a ver c mo se vive en el pa s desde all tenemos referencias pero la expectativa era venir y sentir la vida aqu sobre todo conocer las diversas partes del conflicto
1767823 lo que s hay es un gran respeto por el desarrollo tecnol gico y econ mico israel
1767824 en el college una instituci n con 128 a os de veteran a educativa conviven musulmanes jud os y cristianos todos van a las comuniones y a los bar mitzva de todos y los cristianos incluso acondicionan el men en sus casas y eventos para que los jud os puedan venir y disfrutar sin limitaciones
1767825 s pero el conflicto se trabaja a nivel de lo que es la integraci n de diferentes culturas ense ando que no existe una nica verdad el desaf o tanto en israel como en todo el mundo es llegar a la paz aceptando las diferencias y sa es nuestra responsabilidad como educadores
1767826 en chile existe una enorme comunidad palestina pero tambi n hay una gran integraci n al punto que si hay conflictos entre ellos y la comunidad jud a se manejan a un nivel que la sociedad general no lo percibe incluso se da el caso de un equipo de f tbol en el que hay jugadores cristianos palestinos y jud os jugando juntos o como el caso del tenista nicol s mas friedman de madre palestina y padre jud o eso es integraci n
1767827 las universidades deben ser un mbito de tolerancia nada afecta m s a las universidades que la falta de libertad intelectual en chile existe un enorme reconocimiento y respeto por todo lo acad mico en israel
1767828 el 20 de la poblaci n es de no jud os musulmanes y cristianos aqu se mezcla lo antiguo con lo moderno es por un lado la cuna de las civilizaciones y por otro un pa s moderno en todos los sentidos al mismo tiempo es una democracia pujante en un mar de dictaduras con una extrema izquierda y con una extrema derecha que llama a la expulsi n de los rabes y de todos modos es vigente el estado de derecho y la prueba es lo que le ocurre hoy en d a al propio primer ministro ehud olmert
1767829 existen dos coaliciones y nosotros estamos en la de los moderados con pa ses como los del norte de frica los emiratos del golfo jordania egipto por el otro ir n con sus dos aliados siria y hezbolla en el l bano y ham s en el sur ir n puede poner a toda la regi n en el caos y a cada pa s en un enorme peligro
1767830 la condici n para la paz es un lado palestino fuerte
1767831 el problema es que ham s no reconoce a israel no reconoce los pactos preexistentes entre israel y la autoridad palestina y no renuncia al terrorismo esas fueron las tres condiciones del cuarteto y hasta hoy no han cumplido una sola de ellas tampoco la autoridad palestina de abu mazen fatah acepta que israel hable con ham s porque ellos se ven como los nicos representantes leg timos
1767832 en israel existe plena igualdad pero sin duda queda un gran trabajo por hacer muchas veces ligado a problemas de las propias comunidades por qu no hay ninguna mujer rabe intendente por ejemplo la comunidad rabe se maneja hasta hoy en d a bajo el sistema de hamulas de clanes familiares con alto poder patriarcal donde a veces las pol ticas de desarrollo se frenan debido a conflictos internos entre clanes en el sector beduino existe la poligamia y al mismo tiempo la prohibici n de que la mujer trabaje fuera del hogar el resultado es familias con mujeres inactivas y muchos ni os mal alimentados estamos tratando de resolverlo y es un proceso apasionante pero largo
1767833 se denuncia la desigualdad en la inversi n p blica para el sector rabe
1767834 eso no es cierto invertimos mucho en escuelas y en ongs en recursos cuyos n meros le puedo mostrar el problema en muchas municipalidades es que son d biles en la recaudaci n impositiva nosotros aportamos a las municipalidades el 75 y ellos tienen que traer el restante 25 y sencillamente no lo pueden cumplir otro de los problemas es que muchas veces se trata de familias numerosas en que la mujer no trabaja usted anda por las calles de las aldeas y no ve mujeres est n todas dentro de las casas en la cocina estamos invirtiendo grandes esfuerzos en cambiar esa situaci n
1767835 en israel siempre hay crisis pol tica ahora el gobierno sufre inestabilidad por la d bil posici n de olmert se lo ve mal a nivel personal habr internas en septiembre en kadima y entonces se plantear n dos opciones cambio en la coalici n o elecciones generales biniam n netanyahu aparece como el m s popular pero todav a no hemos comenzado a ara arle la cara

1767840 maybe id have thought this buddy action comedy was funnier and more exciting if i were as baked as its two heroes
1767841 still maybe all of this is more fun if youre under the influence of the same substance our stoner heroes are
1767842 some choice lines aside too much of the humor is predicated on the notion that watching others get high is inherently funny unless the viewer happens to be in a similar state its not
1767843 i was stone cold sober when i saw this movie and considering the subject at hand that may not necessarily be the intended audience
1767844 the movie is a chaotic mess but munchies in hand go with it
1767845 this is the kind of film that relies on its audience to find four letter words funny
1767846 parts of it are really funny although im sure it would be funnier if i had been stoned rather than periodically bored

1767854 our arab lobby in the united states is growing in its influence and its participation in political campaigns across the spectrum our trip was sponsored by the arab american institute one of those most effective lobbying groups of the arab groups in washington and a relatively new group the national arab american businessmens association through these groups we are increasing our influence and we are increasing our participation
1767855 assessing the influence and breadth of the arab muslim lobby would be a difficult thing to do since the metrics for assessing such things are not easily available
1767856 is mainly in the process of building up a grassroots network around the united states with the anticipation that abetted by growing demographics it will be in a position of political influence in the future
1767857 routinely involves anti zionist campaigns and has featured calls at its conferences for the killing of jews
1767858 as america continues the defense of its citizens and its freedoms in the global war on terrorism
1767859 a final and satisfactory resolution of the mideast conflict which is the single greatest source of anti american sentiment throughout the arab and muslim worlds would be an invaluable asset
1767860 the ill will directed at the united states by its perceived support for israeli conquests and for corrupt authoritarian regimes
1767861 has created serious security risks for our country as demonstrated so horrifically on 9 11
1767862 as part of any comprehensive settlement ending the conflict israel should accept its moral responsibility to apologize to the palestinian people for the creation of the refugee problem
1767863 to empower chicago area arab immigrants and arab americans and to be an active agent for positive social change

1767868 have endangered basic constitutionally protected rights of due process and judicial review
1767869 alternatives that recognize and promote equal rights for all people living under israeli rule
1767870 in the face of relentless israeli force the only weapon the helpless and desperate have is to fling their bodies against the beast suicide bombings are no longer the lone act of desperate fanatics but have become a conscious weapon of resistance and war the culture of death and self sacrifice is spreading in many arab and muslim countries with unprecedented force being unleashed by israel against helpless people the task of recruiting hundreds if not thousands of men and women willing to die has become a routine organizational matter in the resistance process
1767871 t he inexorable march of israeli human rights violations continues with renewed savagery
1767872 an elimination of all unaudited u s aid to israel
1767873 cair should be considered a foreign based subversive organization comparable in the islamist field to the soviet controlled communist party usa and the cuban controlled front groups that infiltrated latin american solidarity organizations in the u s during the 1980s it has organized numerous community branches and has had immense success in gaining position as an official representative of islam in the u s

1767878 empowered by american money israel is occupying land that doesnt belong to it is breaking numerous international laws and conventions of which it is a signatory and is promulgating policies of brutality
1767879 a palestinian led movement committed to resisting the israeli occupation of palestinian land
1767880 had involved the unjust and illegal usurpation of muslim and christian lands and rights
1767881 to recognize the legitimacy of that crime is a crime in itself and any agreement which involves such recognition is unjust and untenable
1767882 a central clearinghouse for policymakers seeking to more effectively engage the united states in the resolution of the israeli palestinian conflict
1767883 can only be achieved through the establishment of an economically and politically viable palestinian state necessitating an end to israels occupation of land acquired during the 1967 war and an end to palestinian terrorism
1767884 an organization of progressive secular and religious jews of all ages throughout the new york city area advocating peace through justice for palestine and israel
1767885 we reject the israeli government assertion that it is necessary to subjugate palestinians for the sake of keeping jews safe
1767886 t he israeli military fires bone crushing rubber bullets and live ammunition at unarmed palestinian civilians engaged in peaceful protest failing to distinguish between peaceful and violent resistance
1767887 t housands of palestinians were driven out of their houses and off of their farms during and after the creation of israel they must be allowed to return to their homeland
1767888 w e denounce the continued racist and inhumane policies of the israeli government there can be no safety for jews internationally as the israeli government continues in the role of occupier and oppressor while falsely claiming to represent us all
1767889 brought over 8 million of much needed relief to besieged communities in iraq and palestine through emergency medical aid and direct aid to families and communities
1767890 is centered on educating north americans about the role of u s policy in maintaining and perpetuating instability and conflict in the middle east we stand in solidarity with the palestinian people as they seek freedom from oppression and we support

1767893 freedom fighters hundreds of years ago whom the british regarded as terrorists
1767894 involved the unjust and illegal usurpation of muslim and christian land and rights
1767895 a war to steal land from palestinians to decimate their leadership to humiliate the palestinian people
1767896 if were going to look at suspects we should look at the groups that benefit the most from these kinds of incidents and i think we should put the state of israel on the suspect list because i think this diverts attention from whats happening in the palestinian territories so that they can go on with their aggression and occupation and apartheid policies

1767932 misogyny that was expressed by the media during the entire election and the deafening silence by the dnc and the barack campaign in the face of such denigration of women generally
1767933 in the two months since barack obama captured the democratic nomination he has hit a ceiling in public opinion polling
1767934 close to half 48 of pews interviewees went on to say that they have been hearing too much about obama lately and by a slight but statistically significant margin 22 to 16 people say that recently they have a less rather than more favorable view of the putative democratic nominee in contrast if anything pews respondents said they want to hear more not less about the republican candidate just 26 in the poll said they had heard too much about mccain while a larger number 38 reported that they had heard too little about the putative republican candidate

1767966 of all the talent they could have used they select the most talentless individual in the company
1767967 everyone is complaining about the announcement of mike adamle as the new raw g m but i think its a great idea
1767968 if they wanted to have a new take on the g m storyline they should have thrown several million bucks at brett favre
1767969 hopefully adamle has been acting out of place for the past few months because hes got some real heel talent up his sleeve
1767970 it is amazing how the show that has more wrestling does a better job of character development
1767971 i watched last night for the first time and i have to say that this promotion is terrible

1768021 this is truly exciting now we can order robots from the same uk companies that regularly make circuit boards for our projects for them it is just a circuit board they can mass produce like any other but actually it is a complete functional robot
1768022 the epa regulates exports of hazardous waste to protect health and the environment but it imposes little to no regulation on exporting e waste
1768023 if the epa cannot or will not act to halt the toxic e waste trade to developing nations then congress should take action
1768024 as fringe as you could get as politically incorrect as you could get
1768025 hey america im paris hilton and im a celebrity too only im not from the olden days and im not promising change like that other guy

1768027 i want america to know that im like totally ready to lead
1768028 energy crisis solved ill see you at the debates bitches
1768029 paris hilton might not be as big a celebrity as barack obama but she obviously has a better energy plan
1768030 a complete waste of the countrys time and attention at the very moment when millions of people are losing their homes and their jobs
1768031 the oldest celebrity in the world like super old old enough to remember when dancing was a sin and beer was served in a bucket
1768032 its super exciting just walking around the village and seeing the rainbow of nations with every countrys colours and the different shapes and sizes of the athletes
1768033 its just really really cool it just kind of brings that olympic spirit to a head
1768034 its the first time where we actually meet all of us most of us have been here for two three four five days but its the first time that we gathered were here for the flag raising so it was very special and you could feel that the whole team is happy to be here the village is incredible so were ready to compete now
1768035 i won exactly on the sixth of august 1984 so to see the canadian flag go up like this and now in the position of chef de mission it was very special for me
1768036 for us it is pretty much the last thing we will do as the olympic team until august 17th so it was important for us to be here
1768037 we had to rush through the workout but it was important for us to be here and the kids really wanted to be here good mood great village we had a great camp so people are excited
1768038 one coach had a good analogy he said you know what
1768039 we belong here we belong in the playoffs we might not be the red wings yet but were going to be right in there anything can happen and thats the fun thing

1768041 this keeps building on the nets evolution processing peoples usage and behavior but to do that at a massive scale you have an intelligence system this is an area evolving in many different ways with a number of different companies and verticals
1768042 everyone talks about all the data thats being created and how valuable it is but the way you make it available is by doing something actionable with it
1768043 we are really fascinated with data and the ability to use it to increase effective cost per thousand for ads theres this explosion of inventory but people havent figured out how to monetize it yet data will be the difference

1768049 we believe wireless and cable assets are great places in which to be invested in uncertain economic times
1768050 economic softness south of the border has had a relatively modest impact on results of bellwether u s wireless carriers and cable operators let alone those in canada
1768051 this critical issue appears to be overlooked by a number of analysts and investors
1768052 we assume churn rises modestly starting in 2010 but precedent shows that rogers has managed to take churn lower even in the midst of competitive price plans new competitive brands and wireless number portability
1768053 the tech telecom market bubble of 1998 2000 and subsequent flurry of bankruptcies clearly showed the challenges of attempting to break into established telecom markets
1768054 we view the impact of new entrants in wireless as akin to start up trust companies attempting to make a go of things in the canadian banking sector
1768055 we believe new entrants will have less of an impact on incumbents than is priced in the market recent precedent shows industry leaders continue to prosper in the face of aggressively priced unlimited calling plans from new entrants
1768056 a flurry of positive developments from increased guidance levels improving sales momentum from iphone dividend increases and competitor setbacks in response we expect a number of analyst upgrades over the next six to 12 months
1768057 apples 3g iphone pricing is clearly attracting many new customers and should boost rogers leading share of post paid net additions
1768058 on the other hand telus is expected to launch exclusively a new touch screen blackberry this fall which could steal some of the bolds thunder albeit temporarily
1768059 contrary to some analyst suggestions incumbent carriers are not exactly slashing price in order to deepen market penetration before new entrants arrive
1768060 rogers may boost its dividend to 1 50 share in january 2009 from the current rate of 1 share at current prices that would exceed a 4 per cent dividend yield and should make rogers an attractive investment substitute for a large percentage of bce shareholders seeking a new home

1768074 we chose to go out and work with schools and encourage kids to bike to school rather than being dropped off by mum in the car as a way to reduce carbon emissions
1768075 being younger they will be easier to influence and are likely to keep their changed behaviour in the future
1768076 so far we have worked with st josephs school and children who biked this morning were rewarded with giveaways and we told them about the benefit to the environment
1768077 some schools only allow their year 7 and year 8 students to bike

1768152 florida beekeeping has now become almost totally migratory most bees in the state are moved from two to six times annually either interstate or intrastate about half of floridas bees move to northern states in the summer for pollination or honey production they pollinate everything from blueberries in maine to almonds in california
1768153 seventeen million pounds of honey are produced in florida each year and enjoyed around the world
1768154 the states honey industry alone generates 13 million and thats without the work these creatures do in pollinating over 100 fruits and vegetable varieties so next time you see a honey bee dont swat it
1768155 our guidance to digital photography is a valuable free resource for colour professionals and as such it was important to ensure we were providing in depth up to date information
1768156 after a full review of the original document it was agreed that a complete overhaul would be a case of fixing something that wasnt broken by producing an addendum which is available alongside the original we have improved the range of information on offer without losing anything essential the format will also allow us to provide further updates as and when necessary and therefore continue our commitment to the demystification of colour management
1768157 customers tell us they love the color background cds launched last year
1768158 that media constitutes a significant proportion of all lightscribe cd media and it was logical to fill out the lightscribe dvd lineup with color background technology as well we expect these dvds to be available in more and more channels worldwide
1768159 despite the fact that most cameras have viewing screens it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish areas of sharp focus graininess and lighting quality until the images are uploaded onto a computer these new products tackle this problem by enabling photographers to view their images in fine detail regardless of where they are whether back packing across a desert or on a ski piste halfway up a mountain
1768160 we have seen the consumer becoming more and more interested in products that help them maintain a lifestyle where they can control their diet
1768161 many consumers especially the younger segment and women prefer the lighter and crisper taste experience associated with light and low carb beers
1768162 these are beers that are promoted as low carb low calorie and light but can also be brews with high alcohol content
1768163 these beers can then be lager or ale types but that will depend on the type of yeast that is used
1768164 in the beginning we all start as a tiny seed then a tender sprout with water light and the hope of love we grow up toward the skies above
1768165 its better today and i feel it will be better tomorrow
1768166 landed quite short and when he hit the floor he felt something move in his ankle
1768167 at first we thought it was pretty bad but x rays were taken and nothing was broken but there was some ligament damage
1768168 were not making any decisions about brandons ability to compete until the last possible moment
1768169 no ones panicking right now and were all expecting brandon to recover in time to compete on saturday
1768170 i have seen him in pain before many a time and he just grits through it when he landed this time it was different he knew it wasnt just a crunched ankle that he could walk off in 10 minutes my heart broke for him because i know what it feels like all too well to be laying on the side of the floor feeling helpless and having a million thoughts rush through your head
1768171 he came back to the village immediately and went to the polyclinic for some xray and all that jazz i can tell you that b randon has been doing physio every hour possible he has been icing elevating taking an anti inflammatories taping moving massaging stretching he is doing everything he can we are even bringing food to him so that he can take advantage of every second possible to heal in time we are a team and when one is wounded we all help in every way we can i am sending my positive vibes to brandon and so is everyone else
1768172 saw him standing naked in the window of his home
1768173 to be seen by persons other than invitees and occupants
1768174 a number of hideous experiments fill this room their obvious purpose studies of the human anatomy especially those parts rarely referred to in the new york times a pathetic looking human is the current subject however even an author as fond of lascivious detail as this one would hesitate to describe it even in lewd mode except to mention that it involves a lot of lubricants some plastic tubing and a yak
1768175 are a few moments of pleasure worth a lifetime of regret
1768176 he admitted to aiding offender taking her out to parking lot having relation with her and conspiring with her on this escape attempt
1768177 if we had lost that one that would have been up there as high higher than any of them because of everything that was transpiring and the way that game went you can just taste that win those are the toughest well see the next few days how much it means to us but it definitely gets us off the first game of the series
1768178 its always fun pitching here and i was looking forward to getting back out on this mound
1768179 the fans gave me a nice welcome even when i was walking out to the bullpen to start getting loose thats always appreciated and it makes this place special
1768180 im just trying to get pitches to hit and drive them
1768181 tonight up until that at bat i didnt do a real good job it was nice to see carp do what he did tonight he looked great out there its always a good sight seeing him on the bump doing what hes doing im just glad i could contribute a little bit
1768182 i remember him teaching me all about life and death and horses and war as we fixed the back porch
1768183 i definitely wish i was never singled out i came up there to do a story thats all i wanted to do is write a story
1768184 we represent the party of the great white hope the party of old values where patriotism is embodied in a flag decal pin and where familiar wasp faces will always be sitting on the seats of power
1768185 if you solve that problem you are enabling them to enter the economy
1768186 va en l nea con lo que ten amos previsto aunque se trata de un proyecto b sico que tenemos que desarrollar para que cubra las expectativas que tenemos
1768187 se mantenga una sola red de aeropuertos con la idea de permitir que sigan funcionando los aeropuertos peque os un mismo marco laboral que garantice que los trabajadores de c rdoba sevilla o m laga tengan las mismas condiciones y que se mantenga la mayor a absoluta de capital p blico estatal
1768188 podr a hacer peligrar la continuidad de los aeropuertos pues s lo quedar an los rentables mientras los peque os los cerrar an todos
1768189 la salida m s sana para no privatizar y mantener la actividad
1768190 se mantiene y est en el umbral de los cuatro millones de pasajeros que le har a ser rentable
1768191 no le vemos ning n beneficio a la participaci n de empresas privadas en la gesti n de aeropuertos
1768192 porque los ingresos de todos los aeropuertos se ingresan en una nica caja en la que se reinvierte y nadie recibe beneficio
1768193 si entra capital privado al final del ejercicio habr a que repartir beneficios por lo que se no se podr a seguir invirtiendo lo que actualmente invierten lo que significar a que o habr a que bajar las inversiones o se tendr an que subir las tasas cuando tenemos las tasas aeroportuarias m s bajas de europa un 40 por ciento por debajo de la media europea
1768194 el cien por cien del capital de la empresa debe ser de propiedad p blica estatal
1768195 por lo que habr que hacer planteamientos con sensatez y sin responder a presiones pol ticas pero apostamos por un cambio

1768203 this is just a fabulous work one of the most unnerving and yet often resplendently gorgeous records ive heard in some time every time i play it it unfolds new layers of feeling unlocking new mysteries of the clash between head and heart and digs in harder with the simple clarity of its musical force album of the year so far it sure as hell is
1768204 its a pleasure to hear a group that has constantly defied the odds still sound fresh and vibrant this is very much a for against of now rather than of then the sweet melancholia of the past turned both more haunted and more angry runnings seemingly deathless voice retains its light clear quality as all the groups albums have always shown but matched again with dingmans powerful playing it just seems all that much more right
1768205 for against have been nothing short of great since their formation in 1985 and shade side sunny side is the bands best effort yet the interplay between dingmans guitar pyrotechnics and frontman jeffrey runnings low rumbling bass put the likes of interpol and the killers to shame this is what post punk is supposed to sound like
1768206 factory records is a clearer influence than ever and their musicianship is right up there with those legendary bands this might be their toughest most powerful lp yet theyre not building on past successes theyre making exciting music today setting mighty fires of their own
1768207 they make their icy gloom appealing in a way nobodys really managed since the comsat angels packed it in its good to know theyre out there getting better with age and staying true to their sound despite geographical isolation
1768208 with their balance of euphoria and miserablism nailed down to perfection remarkably for against seem to have reached a peak after all this time
1768209 youll hear something new every time you listen to it new nuances and textures pop their head up just when you think this bunch is dead they always manage to come back and blow your mind and this record is no exception
1768210 hi have i left my phone in the car cos i dont have it
1768211 i like the idea of giving every baby born in america a 5 000 account that will grow over time so that when that young person turns 18 if they have finished high school they will be able to access it to go to college or maybe they will be able to make that downpayment on their first home
1768212 i think its a wonderful idea every child born in the united states today owes 27 000 on the national debt why not let them come get 5 000 to grow until their 18
1768213 ok because last night i was dreaming with a broken heart im just not myself lately
1768214 man this project would be a lot easier if i got rid of half of this team
1768215 it was said you needed permission from both sets of parents and we behaved accordingly my parents thought i was too young but we still wanted to do it i think weve stayed together because i do as im told no seriously its because we love each other share everything tease each other and still act like teenagers
1768216 i just love him when i see him walking up the street i still get these feelings i dont understand
1768217 we want to approach this with a positive point of view we want to carry people with us as opposed to going in heavy handed a fine would only be considered if someone is point blank refusing to recycle everyone will have the correct bins in place before the collections are rolled out people do have to manage their waste in a responsible manner but the trials proved it can easily be done
1768218 the sheer audacity of it is a measure of the contempt in which tesco holds the people of stalybridge and the vision that has inspired recent town centre developments
1768219 by raising the height of the store and erecting a monolithic two storey car park it will completely destroy the open aspect of armentieres square
1768220 tesco chose to hold a public consultation lasting only three days how can this represent a fair and full consultation of shoppers
1768221 the current tesco building is not offensive but the new plans are an absolute monstrosity it will make the place look like a prison
1768222 it seems people are under the impression that is the definitive design when it most certainly isnt no plans have been submitted nothing is set in stone the information gleaned at consultation will be fed back and we can make changes as and where relevant
1768223 the promotion and use of violence and call for peace in the country
1768224 i think this icc indictment is providing us more opportunities
1768225 the reason i decided to do it is mainly because i wanted to raise awareness men are always a little bit reluctant to divulge the complaints they have and nine years ago you didnt see or hear anything about prostate cancer when you are told you have cancer it really does hit you and when i talked to someone who had prostate cancer it made me feel so much better now if i hear that anyone has it i try to go and see them and chat to them
1768226 you can get aggressive forms of the cancer but touchwood mine isnt too bad when you get to my time of life you want to find anything you can that will give you a buzz i cant wait and neither can the grandkids they think their granddads gone mad
1768227 a girl to have a glass of wine with her friends
1768228 were completely made up by the result i just wanted a medal so to get silver im over the moon
1768229 im really excited its mostly doctors and academics who get these scholarships so i was quite nervous at first but i went to a reception at the american embassy in london and i thought if they can do it so can i
1768230 its a fantastic opportunity but its a massive responsibility because once ive finished my research ill be coming back and implementing my findings not just within gmp but in all police forces in the uk
1768231 i looked at the hurricane in new orleans big forest fires in san francisco and the attacks on 9 11 and i thought we dont have huge hurricanes or massive forest fires we have moor fires but theyre smaller so i thought it would be most useful to look at 9 11
1768232 i want to look at how communications has an impact on major incidents see the improvements theyve made over there
1768233 the ideas are good to keep people from abusing the system and get more into work but i suppose we will all end up paying for it one way or another
1768234 theres lots of things unemployed could do like cleaning the streets
1768235 theres got to be some change but it is worrying for people on incapacity benefit unable to work
1768236 its pretty disgusting when you think the government arent doing anything yet about bp which is making 4 5bn profits but will be hitting somebody at the bottom of the pile
1768237 community work is fine as long as its not taking employment away from other people

1768252 when i moved onto the estate five years ago there were burglaries drugs burnt out cars
1768253 all the empty properties were boarded up with steel shutters to stop people breaking in we used to call it steel city
1768254 i wanted to change the stigma of the estate and in december 2003 the residents association was launched
1768255 surprisingly they all said yes and its been absolutely brilliant
1768256 we only had about 12 weeks to get everything done but it all came together
1768257 before people wouldnt even bother with their gardens but all the neighbours have been out helping each other
1768258 now other streets have seen what can be done and are asking when they can do the same
1768259 its changed so much we even have a waiting list of people wanting to move onto the estate
1768260 gta is banned mainly because of its obscene content under the criminal law article 287 that prohibits reproduction distribution or possession of such material
1768261 the police are empowered to immediately arrest shopkeepers if they find any gta games on sale
1768262 he wanted to find out if it was as easy in real life to rob a taxi as it was in the game
1768263 we have stopped selling grand theft auto and inform all legal vendors to withdraw the game from their shelves
1768264 the company will not import gta 4 to distribute in thailand
1768265 this time bomb has already exploded and the situation could get worse
1768266 today it is a cab driver but tomorrow it could be a video game shop owner
1768267 stage a large scale demonstration welcoming bush at seoul plaza
1768268 he was confident the air would be clean because chinese officials
1768269 we do not want you to burn in a lake of fire for eternity do not enter that den of vice and sin consider your soul
1768270 i love the way your inner fascist is balanced by your inner anarchist
1768271 do you have the tools necessary to do your job
1768272 we were disturbed to learn that china has refused his visa we are taking the matter very seriously
1768273 i asked for a reason and they said we dont give reasons
1768274 i said who else can i speak to about this and they said there is no other recourse
1768275 im not surprised they did this because they said they were going to keep out activists
1768276 but these are legitimate olympians with a history with the olympics id sure like to know what the international olympic committee has to say about this i think its really disappointing
1768277 these applications from non accredited press this doesnt come within the iocs purview
1768278 we are contacting the u s embassy to see what they know about it
1768279 visa is a sovereign affair of one country according to chinese laws and regulations and based on other host countries practice on previous olympics and other large scale events china has made appropriate arrangements for foreign entry visas during the olympic games
1768280 i was going there to support athletes and be part of the olympics
1768281 i thought i was a permanent member of the olympic body
1768282 i am saddened not to be able to attend the games
1768283 the olympic games represent something powerful that people can come together from around the world and do things that no one thought were possible however the denial of my visa is a part of a systemic effort by the chinese government to coerce and threaten athletes who are speaking out on behalf of the innocent people of darfur
1768284 the ioc has always been very clear to say we would like the fullest access possible so that you and your colleagues can do your job
1768285 thats clear for us its been clearly communicated in a number of meetings with organizers and the authorities they have given many pledges that that will be delivered
1768286 foreign media will be able to report freely and publish their work freely in china there will be no censorship on the internet
1768287 again i think we are trying to hang on every single word often spoken by people whose mother tongue isnt english let me be clear again the ioc would like to see open access for the media to be able to do their job
1768288 we will give the media complete freedom to report when they come to china
1768289 i guess there will be some debate as we move toward the games if there are sites that may or may not be open
1768290 and the line between what could be considered as a national interest issue might be a bit blurred but well work on it and we will deal with any potential grievances
1768291 we are continuing to work to have the organizers deliver what has been pledged what has been outlined
1768292 frazetta made a lot of money but his artistic growth stopped altogether

1768318 senator stevens has been very generous to his good friend jim inhofe whom we know is also close to big oil companies now we know that the money may be tainted and i believe our senator needs to come clean
1768319 even though senator stevens legal problems have been known for more than a year senator inhofe still agreed to take his contributions
1768320 if he wants oklahomans to believe he is not part of the problem in washington inhofe should return the contributions he received from his indicted friend
1768321 i did not feature much last season which was a big disappointment for me so obviously i just want to play as many games as i can and hopefully ill do that
1768322 the awards day is always a very special one its an opportunity for our dedicated young supporters to meet the first team but more importantly they get well deserved recognition for personal achievements or bravery

1768332 that is why when so many idahoans fill out their tax forms they designated 1 to the idaho democrats
1768333 by contrast republicans have shifted heavier tax burdens on working families because of all the tax cuts and tax breaks they have given away to wealthy interests and republicans refuse to adequately invest in assets like schools transportation and sustainable energy that are necessary for working families and small businesses to succeed
1768334 the beauty of the tax check off is that all taxpayers are treated equally a taxpayer can only designate 1 per person a dollar from a wage earner who makes just enough to cover his or her family bills is the same as a dollar from a wealthy investor democrats succeed when thousands of people donate small amounts republicans prefer big bucks from a handful of well healed special interests
1768335 the pundits may still see red when they look at idaho but the ordinary taxpayers of idaho are turning it blue one dollar at a time
1768336 i predict that two years from now when the people see that democrats in government and they are working on behalf of all the people not just the wealthy elite even more working people will designate a dollar for the democrats
1768337 republicans prefer big bucks from a handful of well healed special interests

1768339 andersons actions did not halt the transmission of the messages to their intended recipients as such under well settled case law as well as a reading of the statute and the ordinary meaning of the word intercept andersons acquisitions of the e mails did not violate the wiretap act

1768363 clearly the last thing we need is a knee jerk reaction
1768364 the last thing we need in this economy is to increase taxes and to go on what i call a spending borrowing and taxing spree
1768365 the production cut will probably extend to the rest of the year

1768401 after much research and analysis of the evolving specialty housewares marketplace feedback from our constituencies pointed to the need to move away from the previous timing combining strong industry support for the summer timeframe with relocation to san francisco we believe the changes are a win win for all
1768402 the timing and venue makes a lot of sense and we at lifetime brands support the move absolutely

1768404 i have pointed out the history and origins of catholicism and how it is an intentional distortion by constantine of the teachings of jesus of nazareth
1768405 this country is christian now before the roman catholic empire invaded it it was a pagan country also christianity is a perversion of the message jesus had it was created by man specificaly constantine founder of the catholic church rather than being the true message from god
1768406 expecting the catholic church to sit back and accept it quite simply the catholic church wouldnt stand for it it would be the end of their money grabbing choir boy buggering way of life

1768408 lee barnes most explicit attack on catholic beliefs is clear when he makes the following denouncement of the entire body of catholicism

1768411 i guess you have to be bonkers in order to recognise someone else who is also bonkers
1768412 the bible is a political book constructed by christians in the roman catholic church from the time of constantine to when theodosius made it the state religion of rome and the allegories it contains were put in the bible to support its own power and influence in the holy roman empire it is not the story of christos the church uses an allegorical astro theological story for the life of christ because the christ the church worships is not the true christos of history or the gnostic gospels the christ of the church is a creation of the church designed to serve the interests of the church and the demiurge jehovah that the church worships and therefore the christ of the church is a false christ who worships a false god according to the gnostic texts there are fundamental differences between the manufactured christ of the bible who is a creation of the church and the life and teachings of the christos who actually lived the former serves the church and the demiurge jehovah whilst the latter serves the spirit and the god of amor who was abba

1768440 that was a tricky one to be fair i kind of wished that the differences got sorted out but obviously theres the licensing issue for bond even if its something thats already come out
1768441 its incredibly hard to solve because theres so many licence holders involved youve got the guys that own the license to the gaming rights now the guys that have the licence to bond as an ip and there are umpteen licensees
1768442 but for me i just kind of thought that wed never manage it never quite make it but the feelings not too bad really its what its like as a games developer you have to treat something thats not seen the light of day as a prototype ive had what four or five things that never happened its funny that we dont even talk about them a lot of the time because you think well we might revisit it
1768443 when an accounting firm establishes any formal niche thoughtfully measuring your foothold in various industries and considering the reception youll have within them can mean the difference between success or failure

1768520 our intention is to have the development completed to coincide with the opening of the narrow water bridge in 2011 the bridge and our proposed development will open a new chapter in the tourism commercial recreational and residential potential of warrenpoint and the wider region
1768521 the proposals represent an investment of 30m and will enable warrenpoint to grow and thrive will create around 200 new jobs and will help to further boost and sustain the local economy by encouraging tourists to visit and stay in warrenpoint
1768522 whilst investment of this scale and job creation in warrenpoint is very much welcome it needs to fit in with the overall area plan for the town i look forward to discussing the project with the developers
1768523 ahhh you mean like to shave no i dont do that wax it hurts too much
1768524 jai la rate qui sdilate et le foie a va pas
1768525 i was one of the fastest writers who ever covered baseball if it didnt go fast it was no good i quit it had to be fast there were times when i got tired of writing but i enjoyed the fun of baseball and everything about it until that damn night ball came in that ruined the whole business
1768526 fast and fun part that was and remains today the essence of baseball writing
1768527 it got a little warm at the end and thats what we need said jayme mitchell
1768528 there was never an august day in preseason practice that it wasnt hot mitchell said
1768529 the only question was whether the heat index was going to be 110 or 120 man its hot out here i heard that a million times at football practice back home
1768530 i played a little and was just ok he said
1768531 i didnt care that much about the game all i wanted was to be a good football player
1768532 it was disappointing especially since a couple of teams had told me they were going to take me for sure he said
1768533 during the last round i started to get calls from teams so i knew there would be a chance to sign
1768534 we got lucky that someone didnt jump on him right away he said
1768535 hes a great talent and i want him back right now its an opportunity to show the coaches they can have confidence when im playing
1768536 just the knowledge that he has within the system hes done a great job of sponging that stuff up hes stronger quicker off the ball hes always had a good long arm pass rush move and it looks like hes standing up to the run as well
1768537 we were poor against kilcoo in our last match so it was important that we got a good result here tonight we responded well
1768538 i think they will be alright they are good enough to stay in division one
1768539 it was a poor performance we were way off the pace
1768540 and perform my fake titter laugh ha ha ha ha ha
1768541 the world health organisation who supports safe injection sites the joint united nations programme on hiv aids unaids supports safe injection sites scientific study after scientific study supports safe injection sites provincial governments and local communities support safe injection sites yet this conservative government opposes it
1768542 since coming to power the conservative government has consistently ignored and denied the clear evidence about how effective safe injection sites are at reducing harm is the government now saying that the rest of the world should ignore the evidence too
1768543 the harper government is once again choosing ideology instead of science
1768544 the who and public health practitioners have the science proving that harm reduction saves lives health minister tony clement is embarrassing canada on the world stage by his ideologically driven position he opposes supervised injection sites yet says he supports needle exchange which makes no medical sense
1768545 after the sars crisis the liberal government created the role of the chief public health officer of canada so canadas doctor could speak directly to canadians without political interference
1768546 the minister should take the doctors advice and stop playing with peoples lives
1768547 they help keep addicts from overdosing contracting hiv aids and encourage users to get off drugs which parts of that does mr harper oppose
1768548 this has been a very productive meeting and we have great confidence in our party and our message as we move into the fall session
1768549 i thank the atlantic mps senators and liberal candidates for coming to west nova this is such a diverse and wonderful part of the province and im glad to have shown them digby hospitality
1768550 just like our highways the digby ferry and the air canada base are vital to atlantic canadas transportation system
1768551 we are calling on air canada to maintain services in atlantic canada and as liberals we are also strongly committed to preserving and enhancing ferry service on a long term basis
1768552 this is an investigation carried out by the gardai however the psni will support the investigation by continuing to invest as much time and effort as necessary to help them
1768553 if there is a reduction then it is down to greater awareness and suicide prevention campaigns
1768554 projects run by the simon community and pips do great work going out and speaking to young people who are vulnerable
1768555 although relatives have seen the body and believe it is him we have specific rules and regulations in relation to the coroners act
1768556 under those circumstances until that identification is complete the results of the autopsy wont be given out
1768557 the king family would like to acknowledge and thank the people of keady and beyond who have supported them and continued to support them during this very difficult time
1768558 the family would like to pay special tribute to stephens friends and the wider irish community in melbourne for their tireless efforts during the past two weeks
1768559 drinking in public is something that creates a fear of crime amongst many people in particular elderly and vulnerable people
1768560 it is also directly linked to crimes such as criminal damage and assaults and creates a negative image of young people in particular we hope to target those areas where drinking takes place and deal with those involved
1768561 we would welcome timely reports from those affected by such behaviour in order that we can build up an accurate picture of the offences being committed and take the appropriate action
1768562 curtailment of street and underage drinking is essential and in operation snapper we have seen the first step towards that
1768563 this must now be coupled with a crackdown on the illegal sale of alcohol to young people by off licences and licensed premises
1768564 i would also urge parents to take responsibility for knowing where their children are and what they are doing
1768565 there simply is not enough available to our young people and i fear that this is one of the reasons they resort to drinking on our streets
1768566 this is a double first for northern ireland and we are very lucky to be able to lead the way in introducing these advances to the north
1768567 the ab coaster offers a core body work out unlike any other while the smartcard system helps members track their use of equipment and record calories burned and muscle groups used thereby offering an overall picture of progress to users
1768568 all this alongside the superb refubishment of the suite can only mean good news for the people of kilkeel and the mournes area as a whole
1768569 this is a hugely positive development for our area both economically and socially as well as in terms of the promotion of health and wellbeing for the people of kilkeel
1768570 i hope it will attract people from all over the mournes and beyond into our town
1768571 i would particularly congratulate the team of staff in the leisure centre as it is their hard work enthusiasm and dedication which has helped to make this investment happen
1768572 throughout the centres history kilkeel has been known for its exceptional offering and we look forward to welcoming both existing and new members to this outstanding facility
1768573 i was going to the taxi office on monaghan street i walked past them and someone grabbed my hair
1768574 i fell on the ground and they just kept pulling my hair punching and scrabbing me
1768575 the man just laughed and shouted go on and commit suicide jump in the river
1768576 i rushed down i didnt know what was going to be in store i couldnt believe the state they left her in
1768577 i am horrified that this has happened she may have been out later than she should but that doesnt give anyone the right to attack a young girl
1768578 at present the equality laws protect people from discrimination on the grounds of race gender relgion politics disability sexual orientation and age
1768579 the legislation applies to a wide variety of situations including employment education housing and healthcare
1768580 it also covers except in the case of age which at present is only covered in relation to employment the provision of goods and services such as banking insurance shops hotels and leisure facilities
1768581 just as it is important for people to know their rights it is also crucial that those responsible for delivery of those rights are aware of just what that entails
1768582 we have had a very positive response to our roadshow from the people of newry and it was good to see a genuine interest in equality issues from those who we have spoken to
1768583 by working together towards awareness we can come closer to bringing about a shared integrated inclusive society based on equality and fairness for the entire community and in which difference is valued and respected
1768584 i am here to discuss the future not the past
1768585 police have been kept at arms length for a generation and more
1768586 we can only offer policing in partnership we cant force it on you
1768587 northern ireland has changed i cant wait for barcroft to change but i am willing to take a chance
1768588 our budget is tight and by causing that damage the service we can provide is impacted
1768589 we can only deal with problems that are reported to us and we must be allowed to do our work without the threat of violence against officers
1768590 my officers and i are totally committed to delivering the best possible police service to all the people in newry city
1768591 it is only through engagement such as this meeting that we can make sure that the service we provide meets the needs and aspirations of the community we serve
1768592 it was very gratifying to collect his first main prize for himself
1768593 the plan is to try and take the participation of hurling in terms of numbers and coaching to different levels to give us armagh hurlers an opportunity in the future
1768594 i put the plan to croke park which will be a sort of pilot scheme for weaker hurling counties which armagh would be seen as and croke park have agreed in principle to support the three year development plan within armagh
1768595 the plan would encompass starting off with nursery clubs from four years of age to u10s with good game structures
1768596 and then the development of the coaching within the primary school sector then taking the current p6 and p7 level and teaching that to p4 and p5 and if everything goes to plan it will entail 2600 children being coached annually in the three academic terms
1768597 the funding for the development plan itself will have to come from external sources and we would like to think that armagh can show the way for wee counties
1768598 we have to admit that we are a wee hurling county but we certainly have ambitions and we hope to have the leadership to take it forward
1768599 we have introduced development squad structures and are looking now for very capable qualified coaches to be able to take them over the next three years
1768600 my attitude at the minute is that we dont want more clubs because the eight clubs that we have are not up to the spec that they should be
1768601 and until the eight that we have are working to a maximum there is no point in developing the quantity
1768602 we are going to be appointing a club development officer for a three year period and all clubs will be audited as such
1768603 northern ireland has made remarkable progress over the past decade
1768604 the fact that there has been such progress is down in no small measure to the considerable contribution made by daniel and john in helping us to achieve a climate of understanding and a brighter future for all in northern ireland
1768605 both men have been true friends to the people of northern ireland and loyal supporters of the peace process i congratulate both men on receiving these awards which are richly deserved
1768606 there is a communal patch of grass which has been completely destroyed when their kids tore the trees out by the root
1768607 there is a big mobile home in the drive way we dont know if they are living in it or the house or both
1768608 when you say anything all you get in return is a tirade of swear words back
1768609 we are very angry that nothing seems to be done to sort this out
1768610 i have been here for two years and no one has ever had complained to me or other travellers
1768611 i am just a woman living alone with my kids
1768612 so what if i hang my laundry on the front fence its clean
1768613 it is no one elses business i cant get into my backyard with the caravan at the side of the house
1768614 they are trying to force me out but im going nowhere
1768615 if they have a problem with me they can move away
1768616 we are aware of the specific problems of anti social behaviour and under age drinking in this area and are committed to working in partnership with the local residents to try and address these issues

1768631 we are a small hurling club and it is an excellent achievement to reach and ulster final
1768632 we have put in a lot of work and after missing out in the championship and league last year it would be nice to get some silverware on the shelf
1768633 i cant imagine that i would be living in a state where we would have three new stadiums twins gophers and vikings and none with a roof capability
1768634 its not possible for that to be the case in the second decade of the 21st century
1768635 manny ramirez got traded he got traded for greg favre
1768636 did you feel like you needed a start like this after the past three he was asked
1768637 not really after the last start in new york what pitching coach rick anderson said was that i threw the ball very well and ran into a little trouble at the end
1768638 the twins dont put pressure on you after a bad start they talk about what you can do to be better next time
1768639 it looked like he was missing location the first two three innings he said
1768640 he got away with a few pitches early and then we got him some runs in the bottom of the third and he found his groove
1768641 the last six innings he was very good he shut out the brewers last month and now these guys thats some excellent pitching against those two lineups
1768642 you know there are going to be more of these
1768643 if you ask me this little run of good pitching started with what livan did on friday night in cleveland slowey said
1768644 he got knocked around in the first inning but when he came in the dugout you couldnt tell if he had given up four runs or none
1768645 and then he went back out and threw eight innings it wasnt a win but when you watched him react like that it was a great lesson for the young starters on this team
1768646 that which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon and our hands have handled concerning the word of life the life was manifested and we have seen and bear witness and declare to you that eternal life which was with the father and was manifested to us that which we have seen and heard we declare to you
1768647 the games were good work out for the boys and we created plenty of chances
1768648 going into the new season we have a full squad to choose from apart maybe from ian curran who has a slight knock and james willis who has just undergone an operation to repair medial ligament damage
1768649 stephen garrett played 15 minutes against downpatrick and will be available for selection while defender ross black has slotted well into the side
1768650 i would like to improve on last season and find lads who can make their way into the first team i feel the likes of paddy farrell and martin havern can progress
1768651 and i would like to bring a more professional attitude to the reserves

1768681 er ist die lteste ber hmtheit der welt wirklich superalt

1768687 paris hilton hat die aktion von mccain als tiefschlag betrachtet aber sie wollte nicht hart zur ckfeuern und so war dies der beste weg zu antworten es ist nur ein spielerisches pieksen
1768688 aufgepasst amerika dieses vermeintliche dummchen hat sich nicht nur in den wahlkampf gest rzt sondern auch ihre intelligenz und marketing f higkeiten gezeigt mit ihrem vern nftigen zweiparteienansatz f r die energieprobleme l sst sie den mccain spot albern aussehen was f r ein weg ihr markenimage wieder aufzupolieren

1768708 we are very active in the photovoltaics industry and recognize the importance of automating key aspects of the production of modules noted mr
1768709 after evaluating the many options from chinese to european and american manufacturers spire was the clear choice their equipment is state of the art and offers the kind of reliability we need to continue our growth and success
1768710 we are extremely pleased to be working closely with tianwei on this critical step in their expansion they recognize the need to automate key manufacturing steps to increase their production spire has more than eighty assemblers in the field or under contract using todays high efficiency cells this represents nearly a gigawatt of production capacity our system is a workhorse in the industry

1768732 i have called you robin redbreast and robin redbreast shall your name be but you must look to it that you yourself earn your red breast feathers
1768733 so many years have gone so many roses have bloomed so many little birds have come out of their eggs since creation day but robin redbreast is still a little grey bird he has not yet succeeded in gaining his red feathers
1768734 but we have all gone amiss even the first robin redbreast met one day another bird exactly like himself and he began immediately to love it with such a mighty love that he could feel his breast glow ah he thought then now i understand it was our lords meaning that i should love with so much ardor that my breast should grow red in color from the very warmth of the love that lives in my heart but he missed it as all those who came after him had missed it and as even you shall miss it
1768735 the first robin redbreast sang until his breast swelled within him he was so carried away and he dared to hope anew ah he thought it is the glow of the song which lives in my soul that will color my breast feathers red but he missed it as all the others have missed it and as even you shall miss it
1768736 we had also counted on our courage and our valor
1768737 the first robin redbreast fought bravely with other birds until his breast flamed with the pride of conquest ah he thought my breast feathers shall become red from the love of battle which burns in my heart he too missed it as all those who came after him had missed it and as even you shall miss it

1768739 i dont want you to witness this awful sight there are three miscreants who are going to be crucified
1768740 it isnt enough that they should nail these poor creatures to a cross but they must needs place a crown of piercing thorns on the head of one of them i see that the thorns have wounded his brow so that the blood flows
1768741 and this man is so beautiful and he looks about him with such mild glances that every one ought to love him i feel as if an arrow were shooting through my heart when i see him suffer
1768742 because of thy compassion thou hast won all that thy kind have been striving after ever since the world was created
1768743 thy breast is red thy breast feathers are redder than the roses
1768744 it is only a drop of blood from the poor mans forehead
1768745 it will vanish as soon as i bathe in a pool or a clear well

1768748 acting on what someone tells you today could end up costing you more money than you realize its not that anyone is out to do you harm its just that others may be so vague that you misunderstand what they are saying being eager to take decisive action you could inadvertently twist what you hear to support your actions if you are uncertain about someones message ask for clarification

1768832 the phoenix project has decided to take an unusual step
1768833 we decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest in the phoenix mission which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains of mars

1768835 had we seen it the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear but in this run we did not see any chlorine gas we may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt that doesnt release chlorine gas upon heating
1768836 theres nothing in the tega data that contradicts mecas finding of perchlorates

1768924 i am absolutely convinced that we as religious leaders and we in the religious community that so shunned and shamed people with hiv and struggling with aids must begin first by engaging in public acts of repentance because absent public acts of repentance i fear our words will not be trusted
1768925 religious leaders hold the key to doing away with stigma and guilt
1768926 the energy of acceptance and love i felt there was godly and this is how relationships should be between people living with hiv and religious leaders

1768932 this is a sad day when u s courts flatly refuse to abide by international law even when a human life is at stake jose medellin was denied the right to meet with an official from the mexican consulate while being detained in texas until he was executed it is easy to imagine what the u s would say if an american citizen were executed by another government without being able to exercise the right to speak to the u s embassy when will we learn that we are setting a dangerous example for the rest of the world and putting ourselves in danger as a result as citizens of an increasingly interconnected world it is critical that all nations the united states especially recognize and incorporate the norms of the international community into their systems of justice

1768934 while the supreme courts decision in boumediene restores mr amezianes right to habeas the fact remains that he is still sitting in his cell in guant namo without charge deprived of any semblance of meaningful review of his detention for over six years and with no remedy under u s law for his torture and other violations there must be a public accounting for all that mr ameziane has suffered at the hands of the u s government appealing to this international body is a way to push for such an accounting
1768935 guant namo bay has become a global symbol of impunity and inhumanity now an international body will have the opportunity to demand that the united states hold accountable those responsible for mr amezianes torture and abuse

1768937 the arizona senator who built his reputation on being a brave proponent of big solutions is running a schoolyard campaign about tire gauges and paris hilton childishly accusing his opponent of being too serious too popular and not patriotic enough

1768946 steaks taste beefy and theres some flavor picked up from the grill but theyre definitely not the long aged marbled prime meat that you can find only at a steakhouse or a superior butcher the surprise hit is the fried fish sandwich complete with potatoes and salad and a cup of tartar sauce on the side too good to be true the low prices are totally true and the food is good enough depending on your definition of what good is to paraphrase a president

1768949 its a tactic called wardriving and its been around ever since wi fi networks started becoming commonplace in 2001
1768950 in the case of the ring busted tuesday officials said thieves tapped into the wireless computer networks of such big box retailers as tj maxx marshalls officemax barnes amp noble boston market and sports authority as well as several other stores
1768951 they used sophisticated computer hacking techniques that would allow them to breach security systems and install programs that gathered enormous quantities of personal financial data which they then allegedly either sold to others or used themselves
1768952 if 40 million account numbers could be so easily stolen the security in place on those wi fi networks has to be seriously questioned

1768960 im a big fan of meetup since i started hosting my meetups last year and they have all been successful our headquarters has asked all of our state directors to follow suit

1768974 we ourselves think that this doctrine is contrary to holy scriptures but whether it is expedient to condemn it in these our canons needs great deliberation on the contrary it would appear
1768975 2 that we ought not without grave cause to give offence to the lutheran churches who in this matter it is clear think differently
1768976 3 that which is of greater significance in the reformed churches themselves many learned and saintly men who are at one with us in defending absolute predestination nevertheless think that certain of those who are truly regenerated and justified are able to fall from that state and to perish and that this happens eventually to all those whom god has not ordained in the decree of election infallibly to eternal life finally we cannot deny that there are some places in scripture which apparently support this opinion and which have persuaded learned and pious men not without great probability

1769018 one of the things that i come to in my limited contributions to the whole doom 4 design process is it has to still be you beating down the bad guys
1769019 it has to be a triumph of heavy weaponry over demonic forces in some way and you have to be blowing demons all to hell around you and its a more positive side of things there
1769020 its not that youre running around frightened down to your last bullet
1769021 there will occasionally be that but it should be much more of you winning because that was always the point in doom you are the hero and you are winning youre going to beat back all the hordes of hell using all the tools at your disposal

1769041 pakistans biggest challenge is to reign in the isi as its involvement in incidents like the terrorist attack on the indian embassy in kabul are reasons enough for it to be reigned in
1769042 there has been political and military support to the taliban from outside over a long period now
1769043 though it is a month now since the kabul incident there has been no evidence connecting pakistan or the isi to the attack on the indian embassy
1769044 as a good neighbour i will not comment on your comment
1769045 there are people who are needlessly attacking our political and army heads over the kabul incident when even a month after it occurred there are no proofs that have come up proofs should rather be provided than continuing this blame game
1769046 infiltration levels from across the loc are the same but the number of attempts have definitely gone up
1769047 often attempts of the indian army to keep infiltrators at bay is misconstrued by the other side as an attack on them
1769048 it appears that the firing that has taken place at the loc today is after some mistaken identity during which pakistani army patrolling across the loc have been taken as infiltrators
1769049 obviously the congress leadership would not have thought of somnath chatterjee as speaker if he has been in the opposition
1769050 when the cpi m decided to withdraw support to the government the continuance of chatterjee as the speaker became untenable as he is a member of the cpi m and also elected to the lok sabha as a cpi m candidate
1769051 he is a party member however chatterjee did not do so
1769052 iaf is immensely satisfied with the radar we carried out extensive trials and it has met all our requirements it has scope for further exploitation which our scientists and iaf teams will sit down and do it
1769053 this was a mistake the anc had made it disbanded the congress and it took over the apartheid stooges
1769054 as a political party the anc was fine and totally acceptable but to organise the indian people the indian people needed an organisation
1769055 i wrote to mr mbeki soon after he became president in 1999 that it had been a tragedy that the anc had asked the nic to be disbanded it was an organisation that stood by the anc always
1769056 the attention of this high commission has been drawn to various media reports regarding the security cover to m k narayanan national security adviser during the recently concluded 15th saarc summit
1769057 the high commission wishes to state that there was a serious lapse in that some of the arrangements discussed and agreed to in advance did not get implemented on the ground
1769058 it is not the practice of this high commission to comment on security issues in detail sri lankan security authorities have apologised to mr narayanan we now consider this matter closed
1769059 only a limited number of security personnel accompanied him which is usual when he goes overseas

1769070 es un caso que obviamente es grave por la muerte de un connacional pero adem s porque estados unidos est desobedeciendo convenios en este caso el de viena que brinda protecci n consular al que l mismo se ha adherido lo cual es un grave rev s al derecho internacional
1769071 la preocupaci n es porque estas instituciones han sido creadas por acuerdo entre los pa ses el riesgo es que se muestre ahora que es un acuerdo insustancial y que los pa ses lo usen cuando quieren lo aplican y cuando no no lo aplican

1769088 die verbreitung dieser krankheiten durch sexuelle freiz gigkeit und schamlose und anormale geschlechtliche beziehungen ist nichts anderes als eine wundersame verwirklichung dessen was der prophet bereits vorhersagte
1769089 der prophet bekr ftigte in mehreren hadithen dass homosexuelle m nner zu t ten seien die muslimischen br der seien daher daran erinnert einem homosexuellen nicht die hand zu sch tteln denn man wei nie was f r bakterien und keime sich an seiner hand befinden und verderben bringen k nnten
1769090 der integrationsbeauftragte ist jetzt gefordert einen dialog zwischen muslimischen organisationen und schwul lesbischen verb nden zu initiieren in dem die homosexuellenfeindlichkeit problematisiert wird

1769099 commissioner staples is to give us some insight as to what producers can expect in the future in terms of production agriculture pricing structure and legislation
1769100 there is a lot of uncertainty in agriculture that is tied directly to what the legislature does and how the new farm bill is interpreted this conference is a good venue for producers to get some of their more pressing concerns addressed or at the least to give them a start of where to go to get more information
1769101 we purposely schedule the conference just before planting so growers will have time to apply what they learn to this years crop
1769102 since keegan has arrived i have played much much more

1769104 i have to say that our fans stand out so much when we play in the premier league
1769105 you can hear them at the home games and even more than the host club at the away games
1769106 there is a big difference between the supporters at newcastle and anywhere in the premier league
1769107 even in the pre season games they have been very loud and behind us all of the way
1769108 an enforced sale which i dont regard as a transfer deal
1769109 it brings a smile to my face when you hear people from big clubs like sir alex ferguson and levy having a go about alleged tapping up and underhand behaviour
1769110 theres a 14 year old in our academy who has already been tapped up by agents and big clubs im sure its also happening with 11 and 12 year olds so its vital the laws change
1769111 officially we cant talk to players about professional contracts until theyre 16 but in reality most of the deals with other clubs are sealed well before then
1769112 we are as big as you dont try to bully us

1769126 the bigger downside of friend connect is that websites using it cannot mash up the data with their own to make compelling new applications glazer confirmed that the data will be sent to third party sites via an iframe rather than directly through a set of apis as michael speculated on friday however glazer also says that he wouldnt be surprised if eventually google or somebody else makes it possible for websites to combine the friend connect data with their own
1769127 im really looking forward to having clayton as part of our program
1769128 he brings great leadership and a winning attitude to what is already a strong group and its always important to have a point guard who comes from a winning background and is a good leader
1769129 we feel very badly for brandon as he finished last season so strongly and has had a tremendous attitude work ethic and desire to have a great senior season
1769130 this will definitely set him back but were hopeful and optimistic that he will have a full recovery and still be able to maintain the momentum that he was enjoying

1769137 it is very safe here you know if you need if you somebody to vent to we have mentors it is very comforting here it is a home away from home people say school is a home away from home but it is not school is a prison away from home
1769138 lets be truthful when we were out there i didnt see any african american people out there but the place was packed with caucasians listening to the same music we listen to dancing the same way we dance
1769139 we was shocked ourselves like for real so we thought we can go global with this yeah we can go national with this
1769140 if kids are on the streets gangbanging as they so proclaim then get them off the streets give those people money so they can make flyers so they can get out there and get kids into their buildings help them mentor them tutor them
1769141 this club is whacked aint nothing but cops around here and only 16 to 21 let in its whacked
1769142 yeah the key term is a blue sky day thats what everyday is hoped for during the olympics in beijing but today its cloudy and a bit hazy so its an in between day
1769143 every morning at about 9 a m the security guard for the building lets us up on the roof its a seven story building on the peking university campus
1769144 and hopefully that information can be applied to other mega cities around the world

1769149 the video game industry looks set for at least another year or two of strong growth driven by geographical expansion
1769150 game makers like us are now trying to get into such vibrant regions as latin america eastern europe russia and asia
1769151 frohnmayer said the new collections wing designed by robertson sherwood architects of eugene in consultation with architect otto poticha is the first of three stages planned for a 9
1769152 the driving force for the expansion is the museums pressing need for space to carry out its mission as the official keeper and interpreter of oregons story
1769153 thanks to congressman peter defazio ancient treasures belonging to the people of oregon will continue to be protected for future generations
1769154 oregons anthropological collections and the research associated with them are of great national and international significance
1769155 the uo museum of natural and cultural history is an essential partner in every road and bridge project that occurs within oregons borders
1769156 each time we break ground for a new road project we turn up new pieces of the puzzle that is our states unique heritage
1769157 and in the process more and more collections are generated we have run out of secure space to accommodate these collections without this new facility we would have been forced to stop accepting many important discoveries from federal and state lands in oregon a reversion to the 19th century when many oregon artifacts and fossils were shipped off to museums in other states or countries
1769158 we are proud to help improve public access to the university of oregon museum of natural and cultural history
1769159 a sense of place and history is a foundation for community building the stories of our regions rural history are available through the museums facilities faculty and outreach
1769160 this museum has a long history of collaboration with native peoples as it has been a most diligent steward of our most treasured and guarded cultural items
1769161 it is because of the uo museum of natural and cultural historys exemplary stewardship and reputation that native peoples are excited about this project and the future collaboration that will most certainly take place in the magnificent repository that will be located on this site
1769162 the oregon department of transportation has a long and productive relationship with the museum of natural and cultural history and were delighted to see this plan for a much needed expansion coming to fruition
1769163 regardless of whats in the inner recesses of their consciences candidates are forced to homogenize once theyre in power
1769164 it depends on what you call winning i define winning in many ways
1769165 put me in all the debates and well have a three way race
1769166 in this country if youre not moving with the two major parties youve got to have thick skin
1769167 i know that sen mccain likes to call himself a maverick and the fact is there have been times where in the past he did show some independence
1769168 but the price he paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position and now he embraces the failed bush policies of the last 8 years politics that helped break washington in the first place and that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its working for you and then not a maverick when it doesnt work for you and youre seeking your parties nomination
1769169 our current president ran for the nations highest office promising us that he would be a uniter not a divider
1769170 well it didnt quite work out that way now did it its about time we had a president who not only said it but meant it and barack obama will
1769171 at a time when were spending 10 billion a month in iraq theyve got almost 80 billion thats not being invested in services for suffering iraqis or reconstruction
1769172 some of this money is sitting in american banks in new york on wall street collecting interest while you the taxpayer are paying for reconstruction efforts in iraq thats why weve got to bring about fundamental change
1769173 do they think that the economy is working right now do they think our foreign policy is working right now if they do then they should work their heart out for john mccain because his policies are not different from what george bush has been offering
1769174 but if you think that we need fundamental change if you think that we can create a brighter future and we can have a more serious politics than we have right now one that focuses on solving our problems instead of on paris hilton and britney spears then i need you to vote for me
1769175 in the coming days its going to be interesting to watch this debate between john mccain and john mccain
1769176 barack obamas continued assertion that americans simply inflating their car tires is equivalent to additional offshore oil drilling is wrong and underscores his lack of understanding of this issue
1769177 true energy independence requires john mccains all of the above approach which includes alternative energy additional offshore oil drilling and safe nuclear power
1769178 theres no doubt this is a living organism the fact that it can get sick makes it more alive
1769179 the onion is finely chopped and fried in a little oil with the meat while it is frying the ground cumin and tbl of sugar are added

1769185 its about sustaining that afterwards for us the best way to keep him under pressure is to beat england like we did to michael vaughan we kept him on the back foot in terms of his performance and as a captain you know that pressure grows very quickly
1769186 hes always been a very single minded guy he backs his ability and a lot of the time he comes off hes become a really top class cricketer
1769187 its going to be interesting now that hes been thrown a lot of curve balls
1769188 we want to end the series well we want to make it 3 0

1769194 from a players perspective it would obviously be a fantastic thing to be part of an olympic games
1769195 weve always just watched from the side and seen how special the event is
1769196 twenty20 offers the opportunity for cricket to become an olympic event its not only going to grow the game around the world but it will be nice for us as players to be part of a special event
1769197 i myself would like to play cricket in the olympics and join the mega event of the sports world
1769198 the olympic games would provide the perfect platform to showcase the game to a larger audience drawing in new fans and helping drive cricket development in emerging cricket countries
1769199 from a players perspective the privilege of competing at an olympics would undoubtedly be a highlight of your career

1769228 we make sure no one is growing too much and that our coca is being sold to people who sell it for traditional uses and not for cocaine
1769229 it is clear there are two trophies we are focused on the premier league and the champions league
1769230 after that the fa cup but we will never go seriously for the carling cup again this year we will have the same philosophy on the carling cup
1769231 the premier league and champions league are the trophies we will fight for
1769232 we want to give hope and belief to all our supporters ahead of the new season and we know we can only do that if we play our usual game full of quality
1769233 i just absolutely wouldnt even fathom the idea of performing in front of people

1769235 i wasnt used to singing solo in front of so many people
1769236 when she was done i found it to be very interesting
1769237 i suggested that if she ever wanted to contemporize this music and do something with it in a bigger production that we should talk about it
1769238 they would know the song we were singing look at the translation and see that is what they say in church in english
1769239 this led to many wonderful conversations the level of energy that existed in the room at these sessions was very profound
1769240 its very appropriate for her to submit what weve done
1769241 it was one of the most difficult and intense things ive ever done im proud of the cd and thats not something ive been comfortable saying
1769242 it went really well i had some performance anxiety beforehand but it just wasnt an issue it was wonderful for me to see that there is some healing going on

1769252 often a catastrophic event like water dripping from the ceiling can launch home improvement projects into high gear but there is a lot you can do beyond fixing leaks and replacing worn exterior siding
1769253 a well designed exterior retrofit will lower energy bills and improve the comfort of your home by eliminating drafts
1769254 homes built 20 years ago are under insulated by todays standards since fuel was cheap then
1769255 builders of that time didnt devote much attention to insulation and air tightness high energy bills drafty indoor climates and ice dams on the roof are all costly symptoms of these subpar designs
1769256 at first this process may seem simple just strip off the old siding from the walls replace any failing trim and put up new siding
1769257 but this limited vision can lead to lost opportunities to increase the insulation in the walls
1769258 payback can be very hard to calculate since it depends on how much money is spent on improvements and a host of other factors including climate existing levels of insulation and fuel costs
1769259 calculations on savings for adding insulation to the walls of a standard ranch house predict a five to 10 year payback
1769260 sedimentary rocks contain the largest mass of organic carbon on earth but these reservoirs are not well integrated into modern carbon budgets
1769261 since we need to know the budget of the natural carbon cycle in order to determine human climate impacts this information will lead to more accurate climate modeling
1769262 this was the most surprising finding in the study since these bacteria are adapted to digest organic matter from things like leaves and acorns which is similar to carbohydrates consumed by humans
1769263 the presence of microorganisms capable of using kerogen may have significant implications for the global scale cycling of carbon and oxygen
1769264 we have found outcrops of the new albany shale which is usually black that have turned a light brown color as bacteria consume carbon where the overlying soil meets the weathered rock
1769265 theres a tradition in archaeology of saying people dont move very much they just transfer ideas through space
1769266 we know that humans had to migrate at some point in their history but we also know humans tend to stay put once they get someplace
1769267 all of a sudden with genetics you can actually address that question
1769268 africa has the most genetic diversity in the world but it is one of the least studied places
1769269 ive always felt like there were a lot of stories there that nobodys had the time or interest to look into
1769270 the family tree of the y chromosome is very very clear
1769271 i like the fact that the linguistic genetic and archaeological evidence all line up
1769272 when you see lines of evidence converge on a single model it means thats probably something that actually happened
1769273 so rarely do we get to pin down the questions raised by archaeology
1769274 this is the first season i cant predict the winner the kids are that good

1769372 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
1769373 both parties agreed that the issue of reinstating the sacked judges could easily be resolved once they succeeded in getting rid of president musharraf
1769374 syed naveed qamar told nawaz that pml n senator ishaq dar had been apprised of the petroleum price increase
1769375 discussions were held in a very cordial manner and were very positive frank and productive
1769376 major progress was made as broad consensus emerged on key issues
1769377 mian raza rabbani and ishaq dar were assigned to initiate contact with the coalition partners
1769378 for god is not a god of disorder but of peace
1769379 the spirits of prophets are subject to the control of prophets
1769380 attempt to try as it were id say to diffuse the whole situation
1769381 the problem was the cheney crowd was in too much of a hurry really bush never resisted them quite strongly enough
1769382 the white house then buried the habbush report they instructed the british that they were no longer interested in keeping the channel open
1769383 the brits wanted to avoid war which was what was driving them bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office
1769384 there was no such order from the white house to me or to the best of my knowledge was anyone from the cia ever involved in any such effort
1769385 a trial that depends on handicapping the defense cant possibly be fair
1769386 the military judge tried at times to mitigate the commissions most unjust rules but the flaws in the system won out
1769387 a trial of this magnitude should have a meaningful public record
1769388 its much harder to trust the verdict of the military jury when evidence and witness testimony is unnecessarily kept secret
1769389 the fact that hamdan could be acquitted and still not released makes arguments over the trial rules more than a little absurd
1769390 but convicting someone with unfair rules cant ever be just
1769391 it was the kind of thing where the cia said look this is not our charge were not here to carry forth a political mandate which is clearly what this was to solve a political problem in america and it was a cause of great grievance inside of the agency
1769392 one of the greatest lies in modern american political history
1769393 its on the record its in the book and people can read it for themselves
1769394 why dont they ask him to give us something we can use to help make our case
1769395 bush wanted to go to war in iraq from the very first days he was in office nothing was going to stop that
1769396 in the book youll see people who are involved and talking about the debate and it was quite a fierce debate at the highest levels of the government is habbush reliable whats he saying how can we check it
1769397 and a lot of people at the end of the day said it was hard for him to prove the negative that what he said was no weapons were actually not there thats hard to do
1769398 the white house had concocted a fake letter from habbush to saddam backdated to july 1 2001 it said that 9 11 ringleader mohammed atta had actually trained for his mission in iraq thus showing finally that there was an operation link between saddam and al qaeda something the vice presidents office had been pressing cia to prove since 9 11 as a justification to invade
1769399 a handwritten letter with habbushs name on it would be fashioned by cia and then hand carried by a cia agent to baghdad for dissemination
1769400 well the cia folks involved in the book and others talk about george tenet coming back from the white house with the assignment on white house stationery and turning to the cia operatives who are professionals and saying you may not like this but here is our next mission
1769401 and they carried it through step by step all the way to the finish
1769402 is really concrete proof that al qaeda was working with saddam
1769403 it is in my opinion true that the administration for whatever reason was determined to have a showdown with iraq that predated this whole wmd stuff
1769404 well you know a lot of them have been walking around with this lump in their chest for a couple of years five years now
1769405 and because theyre essentially free theyre not the original source they said look why hide now
1769406 id done this sort of thing for a while and the way it worked was there were off the record sources who played out the story and then i went to people actually involved
1769407 they were freed up because theyre not the original source if you will to sort of talk about the context what they felt what they did and the people actually involved and of course theyre all through the book on the record talking about how it all worked

1769419 our leaders were our senior ranking officers and they were the ones that when we failed they would pick us and send us back into the fight
1769420 you are here at an institution that has a tradition of tragedy courage and greatness and americans are watching you
1769421 not only is it a benefit educationally but its inspirational especially to hear a story like john mccains hes a hero a true american hero
1769422 everything hes said hes been through to get to this point is obviously a lot like us on the field
1769423 we do it everyday but just knowing that he called the play and i couldnt mess up on that one because the senator called it i had to concentrate a little more
1769424 for him to take time out of his schedule to take time to talk to us im sure thats going to give us a lift
1769425 they are very afraid of losing their jobs normally they are very ill informed about their rights

1769444 nigerians are fighting corruption through which many of our leaders mostly men have stolen fortunes for their personal use they build colossal homes in london rome and new york because they have to spend money on women and have to hide them in these big homes

1769454 there is little indication that the greens will have any major impact on the 08 election
1769455 until you greens demonstrate that there is some level of support for your party our paper isnt going to spend precious resources reporting on whatever it is youre doing emphasis mine
1769456 the washington post wont even cover the greens in dc where they are second to the democrats in voter appeal

1769458 you have good lawyers putting their time in on the case and in a policy sense they are achieving something says ann bartow an associate professor at the university of south carolina school of law
1769459 but in a victim sense assuming you think of the women as victims its not clear what this is going to achieve
1769460 we have never had such a way to lie and distort facts about people to spread lies and distortions in a way that is attached to them
1769461 and you can game it to come up on the front page of google
1769462 the internet isnt a radical free zone where you can hurt people but on the other hand we cant have everyone rushing to the court because the court is a blunt tool
1769463 we need something to help shape norms there needs to be some kind of push back against the notion that the internet is a place where you can say what you want and screw the consequences thats not what free speech is about
1769464 we dont have any middle ground dispute resolution processes in society anymore and courts arent a good way to vindicate these non monetary harms
1769465 i think you run the risk of too much take down
1769466 i think you need procedural hurdles in place since we are talking about a constitutional right
1769467 as an attorney i found it really offensive that ciolli was being held hostage to these peoples demands on a third party
1769468 part of reason people were so upset with anthony ciolli was that they believe he stuck to his guns and defended things on free speech grounds
1769469 another reason was the obvious association of the name with the terror attacks of september 11

1769605 like any dog this breed needs to be matched with the right owner i dont know much about this specific owner or the circumstances but pit bulls are often a thugged out status symbol and are not given the assertive leadership they require heck it may have to come to the point where one needs to be licensed to own certain breeds banning them may only increase their mystique and status amongst those ill equipped to care for them

1769609 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
1769610 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain

1769616 when al gore recently challenged america to convert to clean renewable energy he struck a chord within our foundation
1769617 if al gores challenge can galvanize the nation to develop renewable energy why not ask americas youth to answer the challenge in our 2009 competition we have invited our students to answer al gores challenge
1769618 the device announcements this week show that limo is a very real and tangible platform thats being embraced aggressively

1769646 the inherent intelligence of the physicians and their rigorous scientific and clinical training that allow them to make appropriate judgments of industry supported cme to think otherwise

1769657 we have procedures that are instantly in place and that is down to the hard work of our team here

1769659 farm subsidies may be practical if the money that went into those subsidies was turned into a investment solely to generate more arable land from wasteland and create projects that improved irrigation
1769660 because of the huge deficits run up by bush recall that bush inherited record surpluses from clinton it is unlikely that obama will be able to lower anyones taxes no matter how much or how little they make
1769661 and 200 k is chicken shit pocket change these days
1769662 i provided the data that expalined why taxes before deductions thats rather important arent nearly as high as cliffie pretends
1769663 since gerbil saw fit to let gregg spout away with his attacks i dont see any particular reason to hold my irritation in
1769664 heres a serious question for you though it seems that you find an angry reaction to a blatant bit of lying propaganda more offensive than the lie itself
1769665 i provided the data that expalined why taxes before deductions thats rather important arent nearly as high as cliffie pretends
1769666 since gerbil saw fit to let gregg spout away with his attacks i dont see any particular reason to hold my irritation in
1769667 heres a serious question for you though it seems that you find an angry reaction to a blatant bit of lying propaganda more offensive than the lie itself
1769668 i provided the data that expalined why taxes before deductions thats rather important arent nearly as high as cliffie pretends
1769669 since gerbil saw fit to let gregg spout away with his attacks i dont see any particular reason to hold my irritation in
1769670 heres a serious question for you though it seems that you find an angry reaction to a blatant bit of lying propaganda more offensive than the lie itself
1769671 someone in the top 1 income bracket the people who cliffie thinks are so oppressed with taxes can easily afford to put sizable chunks of their income into tax free retirement accounts and the like while someone just getting by on 40k is going to be lucky if the can put even a hundred or two away for retirement each month
1769672 no cliffie youre just a lying propagandist pure and simple
1769673 gt gt i dont see any particular reason to hold my irritation in
1769674 hmm maybe you should cut down on the cxaffeine moments or what
1769675 personally i think we should drastically raise taxes for imports from other countries including us companies that outsource labor and give local companies that employ americans a domestic advantage in our markets over those that import cheap foreign goods and outsource labor
1769676 regardless of your opinions on spending and whats fair for the corporations if you make under 200k a year you will personally pay more taxes if you elect mccain than if you elect obama you might not agree with taxing the very wealthy more heavily but the alternative is paying more money yourself
1769677 protectionism is always a bad idea due to it discouraging competition and innovation
1769678 protectionism works for a particular group at the expense of another
1769679 protection from competition allows domestic industries and infrastructure to stagnate
1769680 eventually the world economy will leave the us in the dust as china and india ascend to their rightful place
1769681 there will be retaliatory tariffs barring us from markets while our competition builds a foothold
1769682 and eventually well find ourselves a second rate economic power
1769683 i can agree that some forms of competition can increase production but in our current situation i would argue that competition is what is causing us production to stagnate its not as profitable to hire american labor so the underclass who would fill manual labor positions are without work or forced to work for wages that cannot support a family its also contributing to the trade deficit
1769684 and it works for very poorest in the nations in the third world
1769685 youre right the tariffs dont have to be drastic to drastically increase the prices we pay for the goods we take for granted
1769686 i have seen examples where open door capitalism has left third world countries poorer rather than richer china has a growing economy but they accomplish this through slave labor and exploitation worse than you find in most other capitalist countries
1769687 is there any reason why we couldnt produce most of our own goods
1769688 making sure us corporations stay competitive overseas isnt a big priority for me im more interested in helping small business in the us be competitive domestically im less interested in our total economic growth and more interested in the well being of the lower class workers
1769689 also growth in the 90s was helped along by the fall of the soviet union the lack of need for defense spending threw that money back into the domestic economy and spurred growth
1769690 reagan talked about trickle down economics and stated that if you let the corporations and very very wealthy keep more of their money they will spend it and hire more help which in turn helps the poor
1769691 gt the issue is creating an atmosphere that is conductive to business
1769692 i disagree profoundly the issue is creating an atmosphere that is good for people corporations if they are given a license to operate should contribute more to the public good than they take away or they should get the corporate death penalty
1769693 gee dustin the answer seems embedded in your question if you have nationalized health care and a good education system your economy will do better
1769694 anyway its not a zero sum game you can create jobs through protectionism for instance the japanese have their rice industry heavily protected from cheap government subsidized american imported rice
1769695 the economic balance is gone when you employ slave labor because slave labor cannot buy anything thats being produced
1769696 the end result is the entire system is being floated on future dollars if you strike a balance that shifts those jobs overseas those future dollars become monopoly money
1769697 yeah im sure your right when you say he never studied history to get his political science degree as far as his taxation policy we can only hope congress will raise some of the rates he has suggested as we cant continue to be a debtor nation if we want anyone to take us seriously
1769698 its a critical situation that will not be fixed from one day to another or even in a year
1769699 the blackhawks are very proud to have the chicago board options exchange as our presenting partner
1769700 this exclusive sponsorship will maximize exposure for both the blackhawks and for cboe as the largest options exchange in the u s
1769701 we are extremely excited to have mark join the blackhawks his experience and hockey knowledge will prove to be a great resource for our club especially the operation of our minor league affiliates
1769702 davis has a very impressive resume as a head coach which includes an echl championship
1769703 we are excited about him developing our youth in peoria and providing leadership for our veteran players
1769704 simon was involved in an inadvertent high energy collision yesterday and as a normal precautionary measure we brought him in to further examine the severity of his injury all tests performed were negative and confirmed he suffered a strain and contusion to his neck he was released from the hospital and will miss the remainder of the prospect camp but we expect him to be fully recovered soon
1769705 makarov is a guy i think can play and has a bright future and i think everyone else agrees with me
1769706 i wouldnt count out kyle beach or akim aliu to make the nhl roster this year
1769707 i think they bring a different something that we may need up here an edge
1769708 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
1769709 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
1769710 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
1769711 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
1769712 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
1769713 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
1769714 the involvement of charities means that not only will the film inspire people to act but we can also give them a way to put this inspiration to use afterwards
1769715 we want people to realise that they have the power to resist
1769716 we hope that ngos will be able to tell their members about the project driving more people to the site when we make the film hopefully it will inspire more people to visit the site and join the resist network continuing the whole process
1769717 in most cases the support is not just financial we have worked with all sorts of films including features such as blood diamond in the past people came to us with completed projects and asked us for support but now we work in a more holistic way from script development and research onwards
1769718 if the film maker wants to tell both sides of the story they can do that
1769719 we support freedom of expression any storytelling is positive for us if it shines a light on what is happening in the world we get involved to tell our side of the story correctly documentaries can be overwhelming if they do not contain a solution to the problems they highlight ngos can give that al gores film ended with an example of what people can do people are ripe for that kind of activism
1769720 then we went to britdoc and its organisers supported us pitching for funding when people have seen what we have made we want them to feel inspired to act
1769721 we got involved with britdoc two years ago because we thought documentaries were an effective way of getting complicated issues which cant be summed up in a soundbite through to the public erasing david looks like it will be entertaining and this makes it more accessible which is perfect when trying to interest people in a debate
1769722 it is easy to see how these collaborations can work with subjects such as science if there is transparency
1769723 but i think that where for example a film maker wants to make a documentary on the international criminal court one needs to be particularly careful that both sides of the argument are properly analysed
1769724 i sense that film makers often want to make a film and they are not too concerned where they come from i am a journalist and i like to see things investigated with a critical eye when there is more than one view on a topic we need to be careful about where backing comes from
1769725 i cant think of subjective journalism that i have a problem with if it is marked as subjective and clear
1769726 most journalism is already subjective even if it is labelled as objective i am suspicious of all organisations including news organisations there always needs to be proper controls to protect editorial integrity for ngos collaboration wont work if they ask for something too specific but if say they want to fund increased reporting from congo it can work
1769727 there used to be five broadcasters paying high sums for documentaries now with for example the probability that itv will be able to reduce its public service commitments everything is different commercial and third sector brands can invest in documentaries if it is done sensibly
1769728 you need people who will email friends and walk the streets to talk about a project third sector people care enough to do that
1769729 move quickly and boldly to shake off complacency throw aside old habits and rise clear eyed and alert to the necessity of big changes
1769730 to commit to producing 100 percent of our electricity from renewable energy and truly clean carbon free sources within 10 years
1769731 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1769732 to those who say the costs are still too high i ask them to consider whether the costs of oil and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep relying on quickly depleting energy sources to feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world
1769733 reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years
1769734 provide funding and global business building expertise to a range of businesses both public and private and to entrepreneurs
1769735 an oil and gas exploration and production e amp p company
1769736 has already dug 100 wells around the world and is in the processing of raising additional capital
1769737 it would be ironic to say the least if kleiners first green jackpot turns out to be a company that actually drills for oil
1769738 designs microbes that when injected into oil wells increase oil production and decrease use of water
1769739 al gores carbon crusade the money and connections behind it
1769740 achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth
1769741 we are being told by scientists we may have less than 10 years to make dramatic change lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
1769742 we have to live with our feet very much rooted in reality
1769743 were pursuing renewables as well but you cant simply take away half of your energy base
1769744 to be sure reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable and truly clean electricity within 10 years will require us to overcome many obstacles
1769745 it would be difficult for north carolina to meet a 10 percent renewable portfolio standard with only new north carolina renewable supply resources by 2021
1769746 by 2010 were lowering sulfur oxide and nitrous oxide emissions by 70 percent from 2002 three years before required
1769747 the main reason we did it was just to show people what the possibilities are
1769748 a price point comparison will be low enough to do it one day i guess the way of capturing solar energy is kind of expensive silicon is expensive
1769749 this is really just our first dip of our toe into the water
1769750 this is our time to step up and see if its feasible
1769751 were just getting into it right now we wont know probably for at least a couple of years how it works
1769752 coal is dirty any way you slice it coal isnt good
1769753 if you were to put a price on health coal would cost a whole lot and solar would begin to seem more reasonable
1769754 if president bush had pursued the right energy policies and made the investments in clean coal technology that he promised eight years ago he might not be talking about the high gasoline prices today
1769755 big hurdle is fund raising even among a business community that is desperate to throw out mr mcgraw
1769756 10 thinks you didnt know about west virginia gov joe manchin
1769757 in my 31 years of social work i dont think ive seen a crime this heinous perpetrated against a social worker in the line of duty
1769758 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
1769759 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
1769760 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
1769761 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
1769762 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
1769763 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
1769764 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
1769765 i will sit down with her when im president and will say lets work together
1769766 i may disagree with all the ways of getting there
1769767 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
1769768 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
1769769 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
1769770 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
1769771 i cant understand why there arent rings of young people blocking bulldozers and preventing them from constructing coal fired power plants
1769772 the gap between the carbon price and the cost of ccs
1769773 i hope that the strengthening of carbon markets will bring forward a sufficiently good price for carbon that it will provide some of the financial incentive for ccs will it be enough i do not know
1769774 as a fig leaf to give unabated coal fired power stations an appearance of environmental acceptability
1769775 has no right to withhold approval for a conventional plant
1769776 thanks i wont include hope to get the set of draft conditions out today or tomorrow
1769777 wait a second if youve gotten to the point where youre sheepish about us doing well i cant vote for you
1769778 hey jimmy were only guys we show up at 11 30 we tell the jokes thats what pretty boys do all night
1769779 the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived
1769780 coal makes us sick its global warming its ruining our country its ruining the world weve got to stop using fossil fuel
1769781 we have been drilling for more oil and the prices have gone up
1769782 a lot more oil has been found a lot more has been produced
1769783 the exploding demand for oil especially in places like china is overwhelming the rate of new discoveries by so much that oil prices are almost certain to continue upward over time no matter what the oil companies promise
1769784 john mccain enters the offshore drilling debate with voters favor
1769785 wants the government to act to address the immediate price consequences and to act now for achieving energy independence in the medium and long term

1769791 i urge your colleagues to take even bolder steps toward solving the climate crisis
1769792 we have an historic opportunity to shift to a clean energy economy and in the process create new sustainable jobs to support the development and deployment of these new technologies
1769793 im afraid right now that we are more concerned about the business climate than the earths climate
1769794 until we realize they are not mutually exclusive we wont be able to address these issues
1769795 but it should be clear to anyone who has been watching the session that weve already
1769796 under governor patrick massachusetts joined the regional greenhouse gas initiative and became the first state in the nation to require greenhouse gas analysis and mitigation in major real estate projects
1769797 comprehensive energy legislation the oceans management bill and pending biofuels legislation all put massachusetts into a leadership position nationally we support the creation of an economy wide cap as the next step in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but many details remain to be worked out with the legislature
1769798 the time has come for our nation to embrace the possibilities economic and environmental of investing in global warming solutions solutions that will create jobs and combat the climate crisis head on
1769799 achieving the goal of energy independence is the key to building a green economy one that creates good middle class jobs and contributes to improving our environment
1769800 vice president gores challenge is one that asks us all to take action to protect both our environment and our economy for future generations
1769801 our country needs a new energy policy that reinvests in america and it is up to the people of this country young and old rich and poor to come together to realize the economic and environmental potential of investing in a green economy

1769803 having tires properly inflated helps a little bit but that is not nearly anything close to the broad and comprehensive approach we need
1769804 so now the republicans are going around this is the kind of thing they do
1769805 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant

1769813 many years ago christian pioneers had to fight savage indians today missionaries of these former cultures are being sent via the public schools to heathenize our children
1769814 counterfeit marriages called civil unions pose a serious threat to the health of our culture and while the president may believe this is an issue to be resolved at the state level he should use his moral leadership to steer states away from such culture threatening unions not encourage them by showing indifference or political tolerance
1769815 supporters of v gene robinson the newly consecrated homosexual episcopal bishop claim his elevation sends a powerful message of love and tolerance however it is not tolerant to brush off opposition to the consecration of a homosexual bishop nor is it loving to suppress evidence that homosexual behavior is a death style that is sending young people to an early grave
1769816 o ne of the primary goals of the homosexual rights movement is to abolish all age of consent laws and to eventually recognize pedophiles as the prophets of a new sexual order
1769817 gaining access to children has been a long term goal of the homosexual movement
1769818 violated federal campaign finance laws during congressional elections in 1990 1992 and 1994 and the presidential election in 1992
1769819 equipping our children with the values necessary to stand against liberal education and cultural forces
1769820 i oppose changing the definition of marriage to permit same sex marriages or the granting of special rights on the basis of sexual preference i will strongly defend the rights of organizations like the boy scouts and salvation army to participate fully in american culture free from legal coercion to hire personnel who would undermine the beliefs of such organizations

1769826 theres no question hes been in a downturn probably for several months
1769827 there seems to be a cultural gap and maybe a racial gap where polls are suggesting that the white working class just cant identify with obama
1769828 on a lot of scores it looks like obama may have peaked and he hasnt done a very good of refining his message in a way that expands his base this creates a dilemma for him if he seeks to hold on to the liberal base does he risk losing the broader middle class im not sure he does i think that message of economic populism of questioning free trade of trying to cross racial lines in a lot of his speeches is what made him a powerful candidate as he gets more conventional and more cautious hes weakening as a candidate
1769829 these are actually very effective ads mccain is taking a playbook from george bush and the cultural conservatives in the republican party
1769830 this is still running against hollywood its tying obama and hollywood to all the cultural things that religious conservatives dont like in america thomas franks great book
1769831 whats surprising about these ads is that its mccain doing them and not his surrogates
1769832 the second thing thats surprising about these ads theyre like the swift boat replay of 2008 back in 2004 not only did the swift boat ads attack kerry kerry also did an ineffective job of responding to them he let them pass over his shoulder obamas running into the same danger hes not taking them seriously these are very effective attacks that have contributed substantially to the erosion in obamas support in the past few weeks

1769835 the function and layout of the house is very similar to what it was when it started 100 years ago even though there is a greater number of support staff and no live in support staff
1769836 sometimes when there is a formal event staff literally walk out right around the garden and back through another door so they dont interrupt what is going on
1769837 we will put a kitchen and good dining facility in his quarters so friends and family can come and stay and you dont always have the formal requests for meals
1769838 there was not one fact and there was no evidence and no proof it is drivel
1769839 i think mr peters credibility has been shot to bits over this the committee can choose its own destiny
1769840 it could choose that this is bringing parliament into disrepute it could choose to investigate
1769841 the spirit we might say is the matchmaker the celestial marriage broker whose role it is to bring us and christ together and ensure that we stay together as the second paraclete the spirit leads us constantly to the original paraclete who himself draws near through the second paracletes coming to us john 14 8 thus by enabling us to discern the first paraclete and by moving us to stretch out our hands to him as he comes from his throne to meet us the holy spirit glorifies christ according to christs own word

1769864 old problems assume new dimensions information operations with emphasis on a cyber domain asymmetric political or military responses and illicit trafficking lastly we confront the challenge of acting in an environment that is more time sensitive and open to the flow of information in which intelligence sources and analysis compete in a public context established by a global media by 2015 we will need integrated and collaborative capabilities that can anticipate and rapidly respond to a wide array of threats and risks
1769865 our analytic professionals will collaborate with world class experts in academe commercial interests and think tanks all with similar knowledge and personal networks deep expertise will require broad access to open source information our unique collection results and a network of outside experts our understanding of the breadth and depth of policy intelligence doctrine and global situational awareness must match the depth of our analyses
1769866 by 2015 the intelligence community will be expected to provide more details about more issues to more customers
1769867 to carry out its mission in an increasingly turbulent and complex global environment the intelligence enterprise must

1769878 gore backed his case for renewable electricity with logical case studies
1769879 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
1769880 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
1769881 i think that women often face these kinds of challenges of course in our society
1769882 but i think that she did an amazing job in changing that as i think senator obama and bill richardson where hispanics are concerned also made it possible for our country to move on into the 21st century and say wait a minute these old things that held us down in the past were now within sight of a time when we can move beyond that

1769893 in 1970 the u s imported 24 percent of its oil by 1990 it was 42 percent and today its almost 70 percent we import 70 percent of our oil at a cost of us 700 billion a year four times the annual cost of the iraq war ive been an oil man all my life but this is one emergency we cant drill our way out of but if we create a new renewable energy network we can break our addiction to foreign oil
1769894 when president john f kennedy challenged our nation to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely in 10 years many people doubted we could accomplish that goal
1769895 but eight years and two months later neil armstrong and buzz aldrin walked on the surface of the moon
1769896 it is only a truly dysfunctional system that would buy into the perverse logic that the short term answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more oil ten years from now
1769897 a middle course between the republicans insistence on more drilling and democrats demands for more renewables and efficiency measures
1769898 educational levels tend to be higher among those who actually use the label yes
1769899 were not this young beloved entrepreneurial enterprise anymore we have to do business in a different way

1769904 if the vice president says its doable i believe its doable
1769905 i see my role as enlarging the political space in which senator obama or senator mccain can confront the issue as president next year
1769906 sonex approached us because they have not so far had a lot of experience converting four stroke engines to their technology

1769908 das rennen im letzten jahr lief fantastisch f r uns das war ein echter h hepunkt aber es wird schwer werden das dieses jahr zu wiederholen weil das rennen nur auf acht stunden renndistanz angesetzt ist und nicht auf 24 unserer hp2 sport liegt der kurvenreiche kurs in oschersleben gut deshalb haben wir auch keinen so gro en nachteil wie auf anderen strecken was uns an leistung fehlt k nnen wir mit handling und beim bremsen gutmachen au erdem ben tigen wir weniger stopps als die vierzylinder und k nnen dadurch zwischen den wechseln l nger auf der strecke bleiben wir waren etwas entt uscht als wir erfuhren dass das rennen in diesem jahr nur acht stunden dauert weil das f r die 1000er vierzylinder sicher von vorteil ist aber endurance rennen sind unberechenbar und wir wissen dass unser team bestens vorbereitet ins rennen geht und sich der herausforderung stellt ber den ausgang des rennens will ich noch keine prognose abgeben aber ich w nsche mir nat rlich dass beide bikes sicher ins ziel kommen und am ende in den top f nfzehn der gesamtwertung landen

1769913 did i dream it or did george monbiot finally fully induct himself into the prize fools hall of fame last night on newsnight so after 30 years to be treated to the spectacle of george monbiots public endorsement of nuclear power as the ultimate solution to global warming indicates the whole environmental movement is in crisis and has come full circle after 30 years to betray its founding myth someone once said of enoch powell that he was driven mad by the remorseless of his own logic that could equally apply to the sad figure of george monbiot
1769914 if someone had worked out how to cause a war within the environment movement they could not have developed a better means than nuclear power
1769915 the uks dying nuclear power stations are at the moment its principal source of low carbon energy
1769916 anti nuclear campaigners have a tendency to believe anything that casts the industry in a bad light last months edition of the ecologist magazine for example contends that 14 million tonnes of concrete are required to build a nuclear power station resulting in a massive release of carbon dioxide specifications are notoriously hard to come by but i have managed to find the figures for calder hall a opened in 1956 it used 72 500 cubic yards of concrete which equates to 108 000 metric tonnes or less than 1 of the ecologists estimate modern power stations are smaller

1769936 they were definitely rolling up a safety over top and just straight up double covering him
1769937 in the cotton bowl last year they ran the whole football team off covering and we about broke the world record in running the ball
1769938 we see everything we see everything there is and we work against about everything there is
1769939 im sure hes going to see some triple coverage this year
1769940 that could be a possibility if they do it thats why weve got other guys on the field to make plays

1769948 sometimes hes a running back hes all over the place i think thats a good job our staff did not that defenses cant make it difficult for jeremy to get the ball but were going to make it real hard for them to do
