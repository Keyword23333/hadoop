4920161 im confident ill say it again i like all three of them i thought tonight all three of them did a nice job
4920162 as an offense you need to make some plays to get into a rhythm and to get a tempo going
4920163 tonight our tempo stunk i didnt make any plays so i take that squarely on my shoulders a lot of times a quarterback if hes making plays can get the offense going and i didnt make any plays
4920164 its our job as an offense to go out there and score touchdowns
4920165 tonight we moved the ball consistently and we want to keep putting the ball into the end zone
4920166 i missed two big opportunities the long ball to josh and the ball to jason in the back of the end zone
4920167 those two stick out other than that i thought i played pretty decent but when you miss two big chances like that you cant get it out of your head

4920285 there were a lot of great competitors out here today and i am just glad i was able to perform so well
4920286 i really didnt think i would do it because the way the front nine started i was three putting everything right and left
4920287 it was great to have competed against so many people from all over
4920288 it was an honor to have competed here and i am very pleased with my performance
4920289 if i didnt know the course so well i probably wouldnt have done as good
4920290 it did give me a huge advantage especially on hole 14
4920291 its nice i can take the momentum going into sunday
4920292 it would have been horrible to finish with a bogey
4920293 i got the wind wrong i thought it was down out of the right and when i hit it it was down out of the left
4920294 i was thinking to myself try to get it about 10 feet from the hole
4920295 it was a bonus the way it came off i got lucky that i got relief from the grandstand i got a good lie on the drop
4920296 i made a nice putt for birdie on the third hole after a shakey start
4920297 it settled me down a little bit i had a really good up and down on the 5th hole and kind of got going from there
4920298 it played different today with the wind its tricky its a tough golf course when the wind is blowing as streamlined as it is the wind gets in there and swirls a little bit
4920299 i just got distracted on one shot i had a butterfly fly between me and the ball on the down swing i kind of flinched and pulled it left out of bounds i ended up making triple on the eighth hole
4920300 pretty much everything was going right for me shooting a 63
4920301 to shoot a round like that out there on that golf course youve got to have all facets of your game playing well ive driven it really well the last three days if ou can get into the fairway and get some short irons in your hands it definitely helps and youve always got to make a few putts
4920302 put some pressure on the leader sunday i just want to get a good start nice and solid nothing too spectcular just hit like ive been hitting today and see what happens
4920303 i havent played as many events as some of these guys its hard work on this tour you know that every shot makes a big difference for the rest of your life its going to be a big day it will be nice if i can top it off but well see
4920304 i dont think i missed too many fairways which is always a good thing around this kind of golf course i held some putts i had a good stretch going from 9 to 14 where i made some good birdies
4920305 i got myself back into the tournament which is exactly what i wanted to do

4920476 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
4920477 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
4920478 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver but instead tumour growth was significantly attenuated
4920479 the cancer cells that expressed the grp receptors behaved as we expected with rapid growth as well as aggressive liver metastases the implication is that the metastatic behaviour of this cancer is driven by grp and its receptor

4920486 he can still exercise damage control by stepping down before the joint session of the parliament takes up the impeachment resolution
4920487 this will enable him to exit with some grace and save the political process from internal strains and uncertainty
4920488 is the exclusive domain of the two houses of the parliament in a joint session after notice is given to the speaker of the national assembly or chairman of the senate as set out in article 47 of the constitution
4920489 before the joint session to respond to the charges or do so through his representative
4920490 musharraf can turn his removal into a messy affair but this will not salvage his position he needs to make the much needed move of bowing to public opinion his civilian and military friends who have no personal axe to grind need to advise him to opt for a graceful exit rather than to go through the impeachment process
4920491 the way of the world a story of truth and hope in an age of extremism
4920492 just before she died that she realized she had essentially been abandoned by the us
4920493 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things theres not going to be coexistence its putting the united states in a choice position theyve got to choose and clearly theyve chosen musharraf over me
4920494 its all but a like a mafia threat and this is something that the united states frankly deep down understands too they let this process unfold and ultimately folks around benazir bhutto now are saying that she was abandoned by america

4920502 no one in the west who has seen what is happening in kosovo can doubt that natos military action is justified you need only ask anyone who has seen the tear stained faces of the hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming across the border heard their heart rending tales of cruelty
4920503 i think people in both the united states and in the united kingdom and elsewhere in western europe will have to ask very clearly how important is georgia to them
4920504 there was a lot of talk about how georgia should join nato and if only georgia was a member of nato this wouldnt have happened and so forth i think that is frankly totally unconvincing
4920505 the united states britain france and germany are not going to go to war with russia over south ossetia however sympathetic to the people of georgia we are
4920506 we are sympathetic to tibet we are sympathetic to zimbabwe but we dont contemplate military solutions to these problems so nato membership is not the answer
4920507 leave me alone dont get me mixed up with those guys
4920508 in january july 2008 340 cases of israelis both right and left wing disturbing the peace were opened compared to 313 cases in the parallel period last year

4920510 you cannot negotiate anything about final status if you dont talk about jerusalem final status consists primarily i believe of jerusalem and refugees if you want to postpone jerusalem you postpone refugees really you are not dealing with the problem you have to discuss these issues and that is exactly where the trade off has to be made
4920511 i still favor a two state solution and will continue to do so but to the extent that you discover its not practical anymore or that its not going to happen you start to think about what the alternatives are
4920512 but on the other hand if we are looking at what is happening on the ground in israel and the occupied territories you see things happening in the opposite direction as if they are not connected to reality thought is running in one direction reality in the other
4920513 we can fight for equal rights rights of existence return and equality and we could take it slowly over the years and there could be a peaceful movement like in south africa
4920514 i think one should maybe begin on the palestinian side to begin a debate to reengage in the idea of one state
4920515 it so happens that fatah in particular the mainstream party and the only viable alternative to extremes on the left or on the right now needs a strategy an ideology

4920524 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4920608 a running book yes i have read all the running books in my house a few times this summer so it is nice to have some new material on my favorite topic i couldnt help myself i digested it in just a few hours over a few days
4920609 i got behind 0 2 in a period of 15 seconds and i was like oh no not this again
4920610 i dont care who ended it we needed to win this game
4920611 it would have been a rough one for us to lose we had so many opportunities at this point it doesnt make a difference how it looks we need to get wins
4920612 its not like youre down one run there isnt really any pressure on you
4920613 if you get a hit great everybody loves it if not well thats what weve been doing for the last eight innings anyway so we go back out and play defense in the 14th
4920614 theres still quite a little more to do before we can really celebrate
4920615 ive been pursuing it but havent gotten a response from davis hes still dreaming on the price
4920616 i have a partner who has lined up the money to do this and weve been kicking around on some stuff
4920617 thats something a lot of us spend half a lifetime trying to develop
4920618 you know what he expects and then you just go out there and do what youve got to do
4920619 were playing a lot of 22 23 year old guys most of our football team the guys that were really hanging our hat on are the guys in their fourth year junior and fifth year senior years
4920620 were going to give the americans a good shake and hopefully keep phelpsy from getting his eighth gold
4920621 this was an attempt to interfere with nascars post race inspection process and we are taking it very seriously
4920622 i figured the summer would be rough and it was i dont know why that is other than there arent any favorite race tracks of mine in that little stretch
4920623 we tried the best we could to get through that stretch pretty good and do better i dont know i wasnt any happier about it than i have been in the past
4920624 starting here we will start to see some improvement and start a run like i think we are capable of doing
4920625 this has by far been my most consistent year but i really want to be racing for wins every week not just being competitive
4920626 theyve been consistent all year long and they continue to be consistent
4920627 i would really like to see them as high up in the points as theyve been at times id like to see them going out there and doing what im talking about needing leading more laps and being a little bit more dominant
4920628 everybody has to take responsibility for their job he is in that position and he knows as good as anybody that there is going to be some criticism
4920629 but i dont know man it is pretty harsh at times for a guy who has given everything he has given to the sport he doesnt deserve it but working with me i guess that is the breaks
4920630 it was something for us personally to see where do we measure up with the world champ
4920631 hopefully weve learned a lesson and will be ready the next time
4920632 it screwed up my whole olympic experience i had to take the layup even though i didnt want to shoot
4920633 she adds perspective she said swimming is tough but childbirth was tougher
4920634 i wouldnt have come back if i wasnt ready to come back
4920635 its what i do get out on the sidelines and get the boys fired up
4920636 im talking about them when they were at this point in their careers not now as nba players
4920637 i was working with the seniors guys going to college and derrick was able to pick up on things quicker than they did
4920638 he works very hard on his skills he works drills with his left hand and with his right hand and he works on his perimeter game
4920639 but he is a point i am sure that baylor envisions him playing alongside john wall but both are point guards
4920640 i felt good i wanted to conserve as much energy as possible to make it to the next round and thats what happened i feel great going into the monday final
4920641 last year i was running a bit wild and messed up the last hurdle
4920642 i wanted to run more in control in this one
4920643 and i dont think anyone would have beaten him with a run like that today
4920644 we dont have any super super super stars but we should be pretty strong at the bottom of the lineup
4920645 theres a lot of pressure of playing in the no 1 spot colleens had that pressure before
4920646 we had so many 5 4 matches last year that we couldnt get over the hump
4920647 i decided 25 years was enough this is my swan song
4920648 hopefully we can go out there and play well theyre a good team theyre a 3 4 defense which well see a lot of in the next three preseason games
4920649 hopefully theyll get back soon and well get some good work together and have everybody in the right spots
4920650 also were getting some good work with some of the young guys and youve seen some guys step up and get better and maybe help us out during the season
4920651 hes letting us know like youre playing a little too far off or you should play it this way
4920652 hes letting us know from a receivers standpoint what to look for and what we can disguise
4920653 we had keller and bubba franks on two quick outs keller had better leverage at the 5 franks had a little trouble getting off the line it was pretty simple
4920654 some feelings i havent felt in a while but i was excited
4920655 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4920656 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4920657 the good thing our offense has done is be minimal on turnovers
4920658 we had two on tuesday but they were aggressive turnovers
4920659 we really limited the defense not knowing who was in the stands
4920660 we also limited our offense some in the passing game
4920661 i still see some things we need to work on but we are a lot further than a year ago
4920662 i have to play my own game and not think too much i have a four shot lead so theres a lot of room to play good

4920664 youre going to have to learn to play before a crowd sooner or later
4920665 so why not start off the bat and go do it
4920666 what hes been doing looks like a guy thats played the game of football in our system
4920667 the other guys theyre young and very talented but theyre maybe looking right when they should be looking left
4920668 it hurts pretty bad to miss the season but its just something youve got to move on with
4920669 unless you get off to a really hot start you kind of feel like youre behind the 8 ball
4920670 sometimes you can start pressing too much and in golf pressings not really good to do youve got to let the birdies happen let the putts go in you cant really force them in i think its easy to get agitated the day after you made everything
4920671 where we are and where carl is even if carl stumbles and falls back its still going to take a low number today for somebody to win the tournament
4920672 i had so many chances today but i just didnt convert the putts like i did yesterday
4920673 ive played that hole terrible all week so ill just keep the trend going
4920674 at that point i got a sense that carl was still putting the pedal to the metal
4920675 so i had to make some more birdies i got back in the hunt
4920676 i shot 28 on the back nine he does something like that the tournament is out of reach
4920677 if he can be friendly and make a bunch of pars it would leave a lot of people back in it
4920678 even though it was tough i think it was probably worth it for me as a coach i really do because it helped me grow as a coach
4920679 i think i learned a lot about going from teaching professionals to teaching kids that are just coming out of high school and into college just how much more detailed you have to be in coaching young men and being around them
4920680 what we want to do is not boggle the kids minds with another scheme
4920681 fundamentals are very very critical ive learned through good and bad experiences that its not about how much defense a defense has its how well they play the fundamentals in that defense
4920682 i had moved from corner to safety to outside linebacker so i was kind of moving closer to the line of scrimmage so i figured by then i wasnt going to be an nfl corner withers said
4920683 and i was always intrigued with xs and os and that kind of stuff was always doodling plays and schemes so coaching made sense

4920690 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4920691 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4920692 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4920693 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4920694 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4920695 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4920696 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race

4920704 the instances of applicants securing jobs giving false information is not new but the situation has now reached new heights in the it sector which has forced the leading it firms like tcs satyam cognizant and others to take a tough stand
4920705 as the it industry spawns ever more attractive job opportunities verifying the credentials of prospective employees has become an imperative for inducting the right talent into the organization most organizations are increasingly resorting to third party verification of the credentials of prospective employees
4920706 since the company spends a lot of money in training the fresh recruits we initiate a reference check well before an employee joins the organisation in most cases this process is completed prior to the employee joining us if the reference check is negative for such employees we ask them to leave the organization with immediate effect
4920707 we believe that one in every four cvs is a fake or has gross misrepresentation of facts instead of a formal reference check process our verification also involves speaking to the hr or line manager at the candidates former workplace

4920717 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4920718 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

4920732 then i would favor a constitutional amendment until then i believe the states should make the decisions within their own states
4920733 for a moment we were just two christians worshipping there
4920734 some of the richest people ive ever known in my life are the most unhappy
4920735 i dont want to take any money from the rich i want everybody to get rich
4920736 if youre just talking about income how about five million
4920737 we have to have work as a centerpiece of any social policy
4920738 i want to inspire a generation of americans to serve a cause greater than its self interest but i also believe we face enormous challenges both of national security and domestic
4920739 little did you know when you read my blog today it would be the last time your life was as it has been
4920740 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honoring their word
4920741 they have robbed the military base and taken almost everything and they have burned or sunk the stuff they could not carry
4920742 we are constantly encountering problems from the georgian side and everything will depend on how effectively and quickly these problems are resolved
4920743 a major issue is russias contention that the regions of south ossetia and abkhazia may not be a part of georgias future these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4920744 i dont know what to feel right now there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i guess i just want to see my mom
4920745 i have been fairly speechless since the relay this is all a dream come true just to be able to imagine anything to go through the ups and downs and accomplish everything you ever dreamed of
4920746 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
4920747 it wasnt like we were doing this for michael but its an honour to be part of it it would have been something if we hadnt done it
4920748 sullivan came back at the end but i think at the end of a long competition we are all a little tired right now
4920749 on the pop front madonnas life has been passing before our eyes like a decadent german expressionist film
4920750 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by any party affiliation
4920751 i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
4920752 like many im astounded at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate but i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
4920753 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4920754 basdically from my perspective this is simply not a time for politics as usual
4920755 the portfolio of issues that are going to be passed on to the next president will be as daunting as any since the great depression and world war ii and that means that the case for inspiring new political leadership and a social ethic has seldom been more self evident
4920756 it seems to me that there are some big shifts going on in this state
4920757 the people of iowa are saying that they want to give the democrats a chance
4920758 i can tell you senator obama is not taking this state for granted
4920759 were going to have to work for it and we intend to do so and we intend to earn every vote
4920760 by the time the glass steagall act was repealed in 1999 the 300 million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework the regulatory environment failed to keep pace when subprime mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn a patchwork of regulators were unable or unwilling to protect the american people
4920761 i wouldnt trade one stupid decision for another five years of life
4920762 i believe senator obama is the best candidate to restore american credibility to restore our confidence to be moral and to bring people together to solve the complex issues such as the economy the environment and global stability
4920763 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by any party affiliation
4920764 do we really want another klutz in the white house
4920765 its more like a part of canada where they speak french which we all know is the language of elitists what obama should have done was get the mayor of myrtle beach to endorse him not the mayor from some exotic place like fairbanks
4920766 i cant help but thinking we played a role in this
4920767 ok the choice is between the legacy guy who graduated 5th from the bottom of his class and the first black president of harvard law ill go with the latter
4920768 scandals dont stay underground like cassava they always come out
4920769 partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice it is the one way the only way to protect our common security and advance our common humanity
4920770 nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it is the only one you have
4920771 i think that clearly my fortunes have a lot to do with whats happening in iraq
4920772 we told the truth we obeyed the law we kept the peace
4920773 because im not sure im going to err on the side of caution
4920774 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4920775 this reinforces the projection of climate models that we can expect an increase in the frequency and intensity of rainfall events in the future
4920776 and it suggests the model projections are probably on the low end
4920777 and thats exactly what i would expect to happen in texas

4920781 you know what he expects and then you just go out there and do what youve got to do
4920782 were playing a lot of 22 23 year old guys most of our football team the guys that were really hanging our hat on are the guys in their fourth year junior and fifth year senior years
4920783 im going sydney tomorwow no actually in a few hours yes
4920784 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned and it helped me
4920785 i wouldnt have done it without the help of the team
4920786 we came together as a unit of the three olympics ive been a part of this by far is the closest mens team weve ever had
4920787 it is fitting that at one of the most significant events of our generation we have witnessed one of the greatest performances in olympic history michaels record breaking performance during these games will inspire millions of people around the world to reach for their goals and aspire to greatness he is an example of the very best values of the olympic movement and our country
4920788 from winning by 1 100th to doing a best time in every event its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster and nothing but fun for me
4920789 i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
4920790 i dont know what to feel so many emotions so much excitement i just want to see my mum
4920791 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4920792 the biggest thing is nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4920793 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
4920794 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4920795 the first thing i thought of doing was to give all the nutritional supplements i have consumed my vitamins for testing
4920796 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
4920797 civilians are often arrested violently tortured to the point where they die its really very very sad
4920798 when someone says you cant do something it shows that anything is possible
4920799 when you put your mind to a certain thing it can happen the biggest thing is nothing is impossible all it takes is an imagination
4920800 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4920801 i really wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport
4920802 everyone on the planet is trying to make him work giving him obstacles
4920803 the whole things every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second saturday to finishing it off with a world record its the most amazing experience and something ill have forever
4920804 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster its been nothing but fun
4920805 when so many people say it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4920806 without the help of my relay teammates this wasnt possible
4920807 the teamwork we had is the difference in it all
4920808 i think if it was over today hes the greatest olympian who ever lived
4920809 i think the term spitzian feat is a little outdated now
4920810 were going to have to start calling it a phelpsian feat
4920811 without the help of my relay teammates this isnt possible
4920812 its been everything from getting my hand on the wall and winning by 01 in the 100 butterfly to winning the 400 free relay by 09 to doing a best time in every event
4920813 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster and its been nothing but fun

4920816 you learn from mistakes and the tough times and they say only makes you better but i have to first figure out what that is
4920817 this isnt a fun period for me because i feel im letting my team down i know what type of pitcher i am it just isnt there right now
4920818 after the first inning i felt things were going well then i dont know what happened i didnt have control of my offspeed stuff you fall behind and you have to throw strikes
4920819 he isnt used to getting hit like this he says he is feeling fine but its his location and movement the way the ball is flying out this park right now you need location and movement and he doesnt have it
4920820 its just one thing after another and i have to sit down and figure things out long pause for a long breath my arm is ok i just dont know whats going on i have to sit down and watch some video check my mechanics and make sure all is right with that something is off and i have to figure out what it is i have no clue
4920821 how many times have i had to go to the bullpen in the fourth or fifth inning it puts a definite strain on my bullpen
4920822 those guys are doing a great job but they are going to get worn out soon if they arent worn out already
4920823 i was capable of doing well i kept trying to make adjustment after adjustment to see what would work now i dont even stride when he swings
4920824 its hard to play when you dont get to play for 3 4 days
4920825 knock on wood ive been pretty healthy my whole life
4920826 i didnt know what to do but he finally flew away
4920827 i dropped it and it rolled into a big foot print i took a double bogey
4920828 i have to do everything i can to get a day off work so i was really kicking myself after the first three or four holes
4920829 he knows hes the guy in charge and he knows the system
4920830 hes more comfortable with the players that surround him and that allows him to be better hes been improving ever since camp started
4920831 we all came in and worked hard its nothing but a plus for us heading into the season
4920832 theres a line drive over yonder and into the right field corner
4920833 i have a lot of hunger im a very passionate guy about baseball and im a winner
4920834 well i dont want to see them but im looking forward to seeing jay bruce and joey votto
4920835 it was very important to me to be part of a major league 40 man roster to be part of the club
4920836 the movie was very funny and relaxing but the day was very stressful
4920837 stay relaxed and dont panic theyll get something done and even if they dont youll still be playing baseball hey its an honor and a privilege to know alex and to go to his home in the winter and hit in his batting cage
4920838 two campers see an encroaching and hungry bear heading their way
4920839 why are you putting on those shoes you cant outrun a bear
4920840 i dont have to outrun the bear i have to outrun
4920841 i wanted to make sure that when i came back i came back healthy instead of coming back and nursing something like i did last year
4920842 the trainers did a good job on me im ready to pick up where i left off im good to go
4920843 if everybody makes plays there will be more opportunity for everybody
4920844 but we had to activate him because the rules say only seven days for bereavement and that time is up
4920845 i was hoping to let him workout saturday and today and with an off day monday he would be ready tuesday but the rules say he gets only a week so he had to be on the roster
4920846 i dont know if hell be emotionally and physically ready he hasnt hit but well see
4920847 we have some young outfielders and i told him during spring training id like him to come in and observe and see what he sees an outside source
4920848 sometimes when you dont see your nephew for a year and you see him and he has grown a foot and mom and dad dont realize it because theyve been around him every day until they go buy him some new clothes
4920849 i was around this game long enough that i think i can teach most everything
4920850 we have a lot of youngsters here and he can instill some pride for now and in the future
4920851 my aim was to come out and win when i saw the time im celebrating im happy
4920852 i have lived through many horrible events most of which never happened
4920853 if there is nothing you can do about it dont worry about it if there is something you can do about it dont worry about it
4920854 someone in the audience said my goodness as president of the united states that is probably the most important thing that you should have a concept of
4920855 the point is about clarity mccain saying human life begins at the moment of conception and obama trying to punt
4920856 use that time practicing and playing doing something just as significant an ec

4920859 today new york state becomes the national public health leader in tobacco taxation
4920860 this increase will eventually save the lives of over 77 000 youths who will be prevented from becoming smokers and save more than 37 000 adult new yorkers from a tobacco caused death by helping them quit
4920861 i used to be a pack a day and now im lucky if its half a pack
4920862 the prices are outrageous so i go with the cheaper stuff
4920863 theyre still selling but they arent walking out of here like they used to
4920864 i think its slowed down quite a bit with the prices going up
4920865 thats something a lot of us spend half a lifetime trying to develop
4920866 you know what he expects and then you just go out there and do what youve got to do
4920867 were playing a lot of 22 23 year old guys most of our football team the guys that were really hanging our hat on are the guys in their fourth year junior and fifth year senior years
4920868 im talking about them when they were at this point in their careers not now as nba players
4920869 i was working with the seniors guys going to college and derrick was able to pick up on things quicker than they did
4920870 he works very hard on his skills he works drills with his left hand and with his right hand and he works on his perimeter game
4920871 but he is a point i am sure that baylor envisions him playing alongside john wall but both are point guards
4920872 youre going to have to learn to play before a crowd sooner or later
4920873 so why not start off the bat and go do it
4920874 what hes been doing looks like a guy thats played the game of football in our system
4920875 the other guys theyre young and very talented but theyre maybe looking right when they should be looking left
4920876 it hurts pretty bad to miss the season but its just something youve got to move on with
4920877 i came in and the thing with me i didnt want to be looked at as a rookie
4920878 you dont want to be out there on the field making rookie mistakes i want that feeling that somebody could look out on the field and not know that im a rookie

4920888 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4920889 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack

4920962 yeah just look around you 99 percent of the people here are total hipsters
4920963 these hipster zombies are the idols of the style pages the darlings of viral marketers and the marks of predatory real estate agents
4920964 and they must be buried for cool to be reborn
4920965 yeah i dont know you shouldnt use that word its just

4920972 its too early to say how long the body had been in the water and a post mortem examination will be carried out tomorrow
4920973 at this stage there is no information as to how he got to be where he was found or why he was in the area
4920974 if we did a job as poorly as they do year after year after year we wouldnt have a job

4920977 a lot of the portuguese here in the valley were here a lot earlier than the faial volcano
4920978 there are still a lot of living immigrants who came as a result of that legislation
4920979 in the district which i represent in california are a great many families of portuguese extraction
4920980 these people have earned the reputation as fine hardworking law abiding citizens
4920981 it should be made clear that far more inclusive immigration action in the interest of the united states is urgently required

4920993 its a very large amount a ballpark estimate of what is required to get scotland off fossil fuels is either 10 nuclear reactors or 10 000 wind turbines
4920994 inflicting great harm on our economy and on america workers
4920995 ive dedicated so much to my parents but tonight it was all about val and all about coach kirsten hellier and just the hard work weve put in over the last 10 years
4920996 its been a long road but an awesome road and just a great journey to be riding its fantastic i couldnt ask for anything more than that
4920997 what i wanted to do when i came into the circle because i knew i was one of the first throwers she was out fourth was to put the presssure on the other throwers obviously it worked
4920998 every time they hopped into the circle i was always keeping an eye out because you never let your guard down until the competition is over
4920999 thats why every time i tried to throw it as far as i could i was just so happy that my series right through the competition was awesome
4921000 you know thats something you dont plan it just all happens naturally
4921001 as soon as i saw on the board that it came up that she had won i thought instantly screw the last throw ive done it ive won all i wanted to do was get to the fence and give my coach a massive hug just to celebrate the moment and soak it all in
4921002 its just such an awesome feeling to be out there with so many people around you youve busted your arse in training so hard for this one moment and to have whatever the capacity of the stadium is 91 000 here celebrating with you is just amazing
4921003 na fran a a pena de morte pode ser feita por decapita o
4921004 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4921005 i think sen obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
4921006 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him
4921007 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an evan bayh or a joe biden as vice president would help a lot with that
4921008 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience
4921009 russias behavior over the past week has called into question the entire premise of that dialogue and has profound implications for our security relationship going forward both bilaterally and with nato if russia does not step back from its aggressive posture and actions in georgia the u s russian relationship could be adversely affected for years to come
4921010 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation

4921022 if you were in a different environment staying in low risk low volatile areas then it would have worked but not in sri lanka
4921023 your long term savings can afford to take some risk and you have to take that risk if you want to meet the objective if you dont you will lose the battle
4921024 when you live in a high inflation environment you have to invest so that your returns are higher than the inflation rate
4921025 if you invest 1000 rupees a month at 15 percent per year for 25 years you get 3 2 million rupees
4921026 even though 1000 rupees does not seem much you end up building on it you only contribute 300 000 rupees the rest just builds up
4921027 say you invest one million at ten percent for 20 years you will have 9 6 million but if you invest at 12 percent you will get 14 million that is a four million gap
4921028 you have to step out of your comfort zone you have to take the additional risk there are ways of managing the risk
4921029 if you have a portfolio of stocks it is not risky but individual stocks are
4921030 when you value assets you need to look at discounted cash flows
4921031 when you value an asset that is going to give you a stream of cash flows over the next so many years the easiest way to do it is to take all those assets and discount at interest rate that gives the value today
4921032 so a value of a share today is at a discounted value
4921033 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
4921034 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared

4921043 sen hutchison opposes a windfall profits tax because it was a disastrous policy that led to greater dependence on foreign sources of oil and decreased domestic production
4921044 bases every vote he casts on policy that is in the best interest of the people he represents
4921045 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
4921046 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4921047 for gay partners to visit each other in the hospital i dont think limits my core beliefs about what marriage is

4921052 at the top of the oil game but the rest of the world is looking for other energy sources to keep houston on top we have to do a lot more to promote renewable energy its how we create jobs
4921053 we spent 200 years in america exploiting the earth to develop our resources
4921054 we need to intelligently develop our resources by protecting the earth

4921064 dire che stata una prestazione incredibile non rende neppure lidea
4921065 nella gara di stasera la sua tecnica stata ottima lunico metro di paragone su cui possiamo basarci il fatto che ha rallentato alla fine se correr pi veloce non sar perch migliorer lesecuzione ma perch non si fermer prima del traguardo fisicamente ha un talento unico 1 96 molto molto alto per un centometrista in passato gente cos alta veniva indirizzata sui 400 da quando entrato sulla scena internazionale lo abbiamo visto correre molto scomposto cosa che poteva spingere i suoi tecnici a consigliarlo di concentrarsi sui 200 per magari approdare poi ai 400 bisogna quindi dar credito a usain e al suo staff per averci creduto ha una grande falcata e sono stati in grado di portarla al massimo dellefficienza esce bene dai blocchi per la sua altezza quasi fosse 1 67 non 1 96 non esiste davvero nessun altro al mondo come lui

4921075 whether or not they found weapons of mass destruction in iraq is beside the point
4921076 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
4921077 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure
4921078 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4921079 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something

4921081 isnt it wonderful to see him every day on national television enjoying the islands
4921082 we couldnt pay for that kind of publicity and exposure
4921083 its a problem with this long campaign season the election starts too early
4921084 candidates were responding a year ago to concerns about health care and iraq which last summer was still pretty bad there were soft spots in the economy back then but things were pretty stable fast forward a year now the candidates have to reposition themselves
4921085 we need to cut our losses we spent a lot of money lets get our guys out
4921086 ive come to the realization that we need to keep to ourselves
4921087 they need to go back home and become legal if they want to return im paying now for them to have a lifestyle in this country that id like to have
4921088 casualties are down and the news media have fewer reporters there the situation not only stopped hemorrhaging its gotten noticeably better once iraq was off the front page voters shift their priorities
4921089 issues like russia are new so they give the media and the political observers something to talk about the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4921090 in the second half belgium played poorly and we played better
4921091 it was 1 0 for us and would have been 2 0 it was definitely a goal but it was annulled why i dont know
4921092 then in the second half they scored a goal but it was a fault but was given
4921093 when someone says you cant do something it shows that anything is possible

4921102 we have now identified the causes of the quality issues which included unacceptable variations in the lens component during plastic injection moulding in china and dust contamination of the lens during transport and handling to and from the us for specialized coatings
4921103 we have revised our processing procedures accordingly we anticipate that production will slowly ramp up and we are only three months behind our original plan
4921104 this process is not unusual when taking a product from test manufacturing to full commercial production
4921105 the average in china is 5 000 tests per annum per machine
4921106 once we have achieved a user base of 600 to 800 truscreen consoles the associated sus sales will take us to breakeven cash flow
4921107 this should be achieved within the near term dependent of course on our sus production build up
4921108 recent published abstracts from trials of truscreen in poland and china have confirmed the superior performance of truscreen at or better than the initial conformit e europ enne ce product registration trials
4921109 this continues to reinforce truscreen as the only proven real time point of care screening test for cervical cancer
4921110 consequently we are involved in discussions regarding the entry of truscreen into the us market

4921129 obviously president bushs approval ratings in vermont are very low
4921130 i expect that president bush will visit here sometime before his term ends he is certainly welcome
4921131 i think he understands he is not wildly popular in vermont
4921132 with or without a picture of him with george bush its clear that governor douglas sees george bush as someone that he looks up to as his leader
4921133 i dont think it helps jim douglas at all politically to have a picture standing next to the president
4921134 he will be met with massive protests no matter where he appears in vermont he will face a massive protest
4921135 well one state always has to be the last one visited
4921136 vermont is a great state and if the president goes i hope to go with him but i dont have a schedule item to announce right now
4921137 i dont care if he is in vermont i just want him out of office and behind bars
4921138 you know i actually wish he would show up because i would like him to have an opportunity to meet people who think about their citizenship in a serious fashion
4921139 those of us who admire and are very respectful of george bush our president wish he would come and he is welcome to come at any time we understand we are a very small and not particularly significant state politically

4921198 we had two on tuesday but they were aggressive turnovers
4921199 we really limited the defense not knowing who was in the stands
4921200 we also limited our offense some in the passing game
4921201 i still see some things we need to work on but we are a lot further than a year ago
4921202 thats something a lot of us spend half a lifetime trying to develop
4921203 you know what he expects and then you just go out there and do what youve got to do
4921204 were playing a lot of 22 23 year old guys most of our football team the guys that were really hanging our hat on are the guys in their fourth year junior and fifth year senior years
4921205 senator pomeroy on behalf of the president has issued an appeal to the colored population inviting 500 of them to accompany him to chiriqui in new granada with a view to a permanent settlement there
4921206 i see him slowing down in front of me and im still pumping away
4921207 usains a phenomenal athlete no one will beat him if he runs like that
4921208 we have seen the greatest display of 100m sprinting in history
4921209 cameronism is certainly not an ideology nor even yet a coherent political philosophy
4921210 cameronism displays a number of key features it emphasises the pragmatic over the theoretical takes an essentially optimistic view of human nature favours the devolution rather than centralisation of power stresses social rather than economic progress and places more faith in society than in the state
4921211 but cameronism diverges most sharply from thatcherism with its focus on social rather than economic matters
4921212 ok dave that sounds great nobody can sensibly argue against a more socially responsible civilised society
4921213 labour would love to be able to cut the law and order budget following an outbreak of humean humanity but how given that you mostly correctly suggest that the state cant do it are you going to lead us to this brave responsible world
4921214 even before becoming pm he is making a compelling argument for his own powerlessness at the head of government real power lies in society
4921215 if elected cameron will be first prime minister from britains ruling class for half a century but one who proudly claims not to be able to rule
4921216 cameron verges on hypocrisy on the issue of state action
4921217 he has set up a young adult trust which he says is working in partnership
4921218 a national programme to teach adulthood if ed balls schools secretary announced it the tories would be turning it into a piece of nanny state gone mad propaganda
4921219 cameron is quite right that labour is very often guilty of a knee jerk statism but he is equally at risk of an unthinking anti statism
4921220 they concern us deeply because they can with little effort be modified to fire a live round
4921221 most of the replicas have a solid barrel and theyre just a toy
4921222 our licensing regime in western australia makes it difficult for people to get licences for handguns
4921223 youve got to belong to a licensed club and theres certain amount of time that youve got to prove yourself
4921224 if you have tampered with it in some way then id dispose of the firearm because its a danger to yourself and a danger to your children if they get their hands on it
4921225 its a technical issue with the rudder that will be rectified overnight
4921226 but its hard for us to envision a scenario where students cant get federal loans for school this year
4921227 the joke is that congress took away half their profit and the credit crisis took away their other half
4921228 its not like subprime mortgages where people just took out loans and werent able to repay them
4921229 the government guarantees these loans these are very secure investments
4921230 this runs counter to the goals and purpose of the federal student loan program which was established to provide loans to students who would not otherwise be able to borrow to pay for college
4921231 for a long time people kind of got use to going to the doctors and filing a claim now its like we want the whole bill upfront
4921232 we are like any other business we have to collect our money to pay our bills its far easier to collect upfront than to go after someone on the back end
4921233 its reasonable to go an eye doctor on monday and then visit other doctors on wednesday and thursday and there will be an overpayment
4921234 jitender had not even made it to the semi finals in the state level competition but we felt he had the talent to make it big
4921235 he had fire in him and we could see that he wanted to excel
4921236 he had the right physique to be a good boxer he had good height and the right mentality too the moment we saw him we knew we had discovered a top performer
4921237 we try to pick them at an early stage give them proper training before unleashing them in the national sub junior junior and senior levels after that its up to the national federation said thakran whos also the co ordinator of indian amateur boxing federation iabf
4921238 just prior to these games we sent the qualified boxers to taiwan for the presidents cup where all the top boxers of the world were present
4921239 then a training cum competition programme in germany prepared them properly for the olympics in between they had their regular camps at patiala
4921240 we have lot of faith on our boxers they are no less than any other in the world their wins are not at all surprising daggar said
4921241 they have beaten big names in the past and i am sure they will continue to do so in the future
4921242 it was a sweet revenge today because i lost to them with yves allegro four years ago in athens
4921243 i mean we expected it to be much tougher but in a best two out of three set doubles match anything can happen and we know that maybe the classic doubles teams are into the semifinals of the olympic games and we have a great challenge coming up
4921244 i think the lead was important it was good to sleep well and start off in a positive mindset and continue what we have been doing
4921245 it has been a great tournament for us weve played well and we improved a lot during the last match they paes bhupathi were a very good doubles team but we played together and played incredible tennis
4921246 getting to play with world number one player is a huge opportunity and its great to be together in the court and hear the crowd root for us
4921247 jitender had not even made it to the semi finals in the state level competition but we felt he had the talent to make it big
4921248 he had fire in him and we could see that he wanted to excel
4921249 he had the right physique to be a good boxer he had good height and the right mentality too the moment we saw him we knew we had discovered a top performer
4921250 we try to pick them at an early stage give them proper training before unleashing them in the national sub junior junior and senior levels after that its up to the national federation said thakran whos also the co ordinator of indian amateur boxing federation iabf
4921251 just prior to these games we sent the qualified boxers to taiwan for the presidents cup where all the top boxers of the world were present

4921254 they have beaten big names in the past and i am sure they will continue to do so in the future
4921255 theres no surer way to turn new female fans into former female fans than by complaining about how hard it is to keep on weight
4921256 its just ridiculous the thing looks like a dog pound
4921257 hei udin tolong jawab pertanyaan ibu yah kalo ada 5 ekor burung di jendela kemudian ditembak satu berapa yang masih tertinggal
4921258 salah harusnya dijawab masih tinggal 4 ekor tapi saya seneng kok cara kamu berpikir

4921260 salah harusnya dijawab yang sudah pake cincin kawin tapi saya senang melihat cara berpikir bu guru
4921261 the problem is that it is going to be more expensive
4921262 i think our students will be ok because they can choose any lender that they like
4921263 the debt has increased our risk of being held hostage by foreign lenders
4921264 our situation is serious and it is deteriorating with the passage of time
4921265 the financial condition of the u s is worse than advertised
4921266 its inevitable there will be some tax increases on fat cats like myself
4921267 but any idea youre going to solve most of this problem with taxes is not realistic
4921268 arthur laffer said to me addison im not a debt guy
4921269 but that doesnt take into account everything thats coming down the pike
4921270 id like to see you write a follow up on who should take advantage of this credit
4921271 being that its a loan it obviously isnt going to be economical for everyone
4921272 i am not in any way struggling to pay my mortgage and i dont have credit card debt
4921273 sure i need a lawn mower and i wouldnt mind the boost in my savings since my down payment wiped me out but is this tax credit really economical if i dont really need the money for anything except immediate gratification
4921274 dont miss what could be the opportunity of a lifetime to get into the home of your dreams
4921275 the nations homebuilders are confident that a new temporary 7 500 tax credit for first time homebuyers will get buyers back into the marketplace and help end the current cyclical downturn in the housing industry
4921276 if someone knocked on your door and said hey i have 7 500 to lend you at zero percent interest and you can pay me back over 15 years would you take the money
4921277 probably not unless i had something specifically i needed the money for
4921278 when you point out that this is debt no matter how you slice it and that you are responsible for that debt i see it another way
4921279 taken in isolation and all things being equal if you had a healthier population you are going to have lower absentee rates and lower health care costs
4921280 this is becoming a factor and this is going to be a big difference
4921281 companies are going to be looking at wellness to lower their health care costs if it will cut their premiums
4921282 because companies are only going to get more serious about health care
4921283 since everyone in the organization is doing the same thing everyone is motivated
4921284 if everyone else is doing it and you are not its awkward
4921285 i thought there might be chinese fireworks or chinese food but its really lacking
4921286 it the chinese government has failed by acting in this way it has shown the world this is a country that does not respect human rights
4921287 ive had a wonderful trip this week i started off by having a chance to go to the olympic games opening ceremony and see a lot of those games which were fantastically managed
4921288 it was a surprise for me where was all the pollution i have read about in the newspapers
4921289 i dont know about the political discussions going on and its linkage with the sof
4921290 neither did the finance minister nor did the petroleum minister pay any visit to saudi arabia as a follow up for obtaining the sof on deferred payments
4921291 all passangers number two is going lexington express number five route for all passangers wanting the west side number five is going broadway local number two route
4921292 speaking of the yoga yesterday i wore my hottest sassiest little yoga outfit to class my boobs threaten to pop out of this tiny top with every position im totally yoga bimbo yogimbo in this thing wouldnt you know it the instructor last night was the hottest yoga instructor i have ever laid eyes on i know i know yoga instructors arent supposed to be the hottest species i think bikram yoga instructors are the exception the women instructors are so hot they could turn me gay besides having lost 14 pounds and 7 body fat since july now i have one more reason to remain dedicated to the practice and to buy a couple more adorable little get ups
4921293 if your client takes the stand and tells his side of the story its a lot longer than if hes not he needs to know the law hes testifying every case is different there are drunk drivings that are more complicated than a simple homicide
4921294 there was reliance on expert testimony and nothing to rebut it
4921295 its our opinion if he had checked with a competent medical examiner or any medical examiner they would have given the same opinion as the medical examiner richards hired
4921296 to argue self defense is very difficult where the state expert says he was shot execution style down on the ground
4921297 i think hes innocent if i made mistakes and they warrant a new trial then good
4921298 i was hoping wed win the case the jury found otherwise i still believe it was self defense
4921299 there are a lot of reasons these are questions ill be asked under oath in court id prefer to answer under oath those answers will come

4921320 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4921321 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4921322 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4921323 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4921324 it cant be described well never ever see it again
4921325 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change

4921329 millions of indians identify him with his hat much like mahatma gandhi is identified with his glasses and stick
4921330 by showing him in a pagari the present leaders are trying to classify him on regional and communal lines it is just divisive politics
4921331 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4921332 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4921333 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4921334 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4921335 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4921336 i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective
4921337 the burma project initiates supports and administers a range of programs and activities around the globe

4921346 eraserheads members should not allow themselves to be deceived by philip morris and should protect their fans from this devious marketing ploy considered one of the most influential bands in the philippines eraserheads has become a role model for our youth i hope they will rise to the challenge and help young filipinos lead healthy tobacco free lives by finding other sponsorship for the concert
4921347 once again philip morris international has been caught engaging in cigarette marketing that appeals to children in a developing country and that would not be tolerated in the united states and other wealthier nations
4921348 the issue isnt just whether philip morris international has violated philippine law but whether tobacco companies should be engaged in such youth oriented marketing anywhere philip morris international should immediately cease all such sponsorships and promotions in all countries

4921375 i feel like credit card companies target us because we really have no financial awareness
4921376 were barely out of our homes barely having experiences as adults and they throw these things at us and they dont make you aware of what youre signing into
4921377 i think when those provisions in these agreements become public sometime relatively soon i think it will shock many people the kinds of relationships that some of these credit card companies have with the schools
4921378 a rule put in place by former secretary of state kenneth blackwell required the party to turn in more than 40 000 signatures 120 days before the presidential primary that law was struck down as unconstitutional in 2006 by the 6th u s circuit court of appeals in cincinnati because it violated the partys first amendment rights of free association by preventing access to the ballot

4921391 the severity of it will impact customer demand well see how much the customer can absorb and still plan on travelling
4921392 i really think its important that we have jurisdictional control to ensure that we decide whats in our nations interest
4921393 we would make the rules on ensuring that the environment remains protected not to mention the economic benefits of the natural resources as well
4921394 i dont think government should fool people into thinking it can control the price of gas it generally speaking cant
4921395 these prices are set internationally we are seeing increased prices around the world
4921396 what we havent seen yet is that seasonal rise in gas prices related to supply and demand
4921397 what will serve to moderate the spike is the fact that we are entering the peak gasoline demand season with inventories in quite good shape
4921398 in the next generation our economy will have to make a significant transition to a lot less reliance on hydrocarbons
4921399 what government shouldnt do is jump in and actually increase the taxes on these products which as you know is what my opposition is proposing to do
4921400 dion has the right ideas but he absolutely lacks the strength of character to back his beliefs with action aka the paul martin syndrome and maybe its just me but i swear his english is getting worse every day
4921401 the indian ships will be present in the ior for a while doing some flag showing and also engaging in naval diplomacy with some port calls mid sea exercises and interaction with personnel from the navies of the west asian countries and the african continent
4921402 with indias economic interest in west asia and african region increasing navy will be playing its diplomatic role by visiting more ports all along the coast of eastern africa touching the horn of africa
4921403 most of the navies in eastern africa are small in size compared to the indian navy what we would be aiming during these interaction is to give them the confidence that india would come to their aid whenever there is a need considering that we have enough experience in all aspects of naval operations be it military diplomatic policing or benign
4921404 the mauritian ship is from the indian naval service it was given to mauritius for their use and we have an agreement with them for the ships regular refit and repair this towing of the maurutian ship is under that agreement
4921405 goodbye steam engines goodbye carnot cycles here we are with electricity we dont need you any longer
4921406 the key points is the transition from a chemical energy base built on fossil fuels to a physical energy base built mainly on electricity from renewable sources the transition is predetermined by the laws of physics it could not be avoided or significantly delayed by politics however the transition will proceed more smoothly if all players agreed to move in to the same direction
4921407 if hydrogen is ever to be play a significant role in our energy future specifically directed toward replacing transportation fuels as their supply diminishes it will be required that an abundant and distributed source of inexpensive renewable energy be exploited which is significantly less capital intensive than current methods of producing renewable electricity

4921414 by 2010 the production of the fuel that has driven the worlds economy will start to rapidly decline this will conflict with the steadily increasing demand for oil the collision of these two trends will lead to shortages and increased prices providing a strong incentive to shift to alternative fuel resources due to unequal distribution through the world of oil and gas supply and consumption the upcoming transition will result in significant shifts in global power and wealth
4921415 id say leave fusion for space rockets we dont actually need it on earth if we design our societies correctly we are better off living as peers with the rest of the ecology making use of our alloted photons like every other living organism in a sense as energy equals to other dumber forms of life if we live this way we can be pretty certain we wont overstep our ecological niche and destroy the environment coming up with a good small high energy source just means we will hit peak something else in the future given our population growth id guess it would be peak food
4921416 you probably could generate fission using methods not all that different from a fusor but i can not see you reaching break even its a cross section thing and probability thing i went through my own farnsworth fusor phase myself i think its something everyone goes through that looks at the problem but if you step back and think a bit about cross section collision probabilities and energy densities you become a advocate for electric rail and renewable sources of electricity
4921417 backing up a little bit coal fired plants could be constructed even faster if we really needed the electricity
4921418 energy equality with the ecosystem forces us to solve our population problem which is the real problem we face peak oil is a symptom so treat the real disease and start living within our means
4921419 as far as crossections etc all i can say as showme
4921420 on november 9 and 10 2005 they obtained dd fusion at about 10 kv with b fields of 1300 gauss in a 30 cm diameter device it produced a pulse of dd fusions at 109 fusions second that was 200 000 times higher then anything that hirsch and farnsworth had ever achieved in any experiment they had ever done for similar well depths and drive conditions
4921421 the initial analysis showed that bussards data on energy yields were consistent with expectations

4921436 a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities depending upon the characterics of the crude stream it may also include 1 small amounts of hydrocarbons that exist in gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but are liquid at atmospheric pressure after being recovered from oil well casinghead gas in lease separators and are subsequently commingled with the crude stream without being separately measured lease condensate recovered as a liquid from natural gas wells in lease or field separation facilities and later mixed into the crude stream is also included 2 small amounts of nonhydrocarbons produced with the oil such as sulfur and various metals 3 drip gases and liquid hydrocarbons produced from tar sands oil sands gilsonite and oil shale

4921439 much of it was built following world war ii so its fifty or sixty years old and its being attacked by decay and neglect
4921440 plus our population is still growing dramatically so not only do we have old and outdated infrastructure we are also putting new demands on it its just being stretched in many different ways
4921441 weve probably got ticking time bombs out there and if we dont take care of our infrastructure if we continue to neglect its maintenance then its not going to be able to take care of us
4921442 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4921443 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4921444 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4921445 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now

4921458 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4921459 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4921460 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4921461 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4921462 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue
4921463 a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker there should be appropriate levels of pastoral care and community involvement in deciding where these workers will be placed
4921464 im not overly comfortable about foreign labour coming into our workplaces but theres an undeniable labour shortage
4921465 im worried about these industries collapsing under the pressure of that labour shortage
4921466 okay well if this resource is gone were going to replace them with biofuels
4921467 okay grass we are going to cut you every year year after year remove everything that we cut and burn it elsewhere
4921468 theres a problem peak oil thats upon us and theres an answer available now
4921469 you think its bad with it try living without it
4921470 we can live without wasteful conversion of foodstuffs into motor fuel after all we did it for so long and we arguably ate better then
4921471 even if ethanol energetics were not favorable there is an argument to be made in favor of ethanol in agriculture and ethanol production the crude oil inputs are minor the majority of the fossil energy used to grow corn and produce ethanol comes from natural gas and coal in this analysis it is estimated that on an energy basis 0 073 btu of petroleum are used to produce a btu of ethanol ethanol should be viewed as an extremely effective way to convert gaseous and solid fuel energy into liquid fuel energy it is a fact that us ethanol production increases the supply of liquid fuels with the consequence of depressing fuel prices because ethanol has a positive energy balance it necessarily has a positive impact on climate change today neither of these external benefits is properly considered in the pricing of the fuel to that end it is the purpose of policy to address such issues
4921472 this discussion is especially relevant in canada now because of bill c 33 which amends the canadian environmental protection act and is supposed to be debated in the house of commons around may 28th 2008
4921473 there are two fundamental solutions one is to limit the human population there is just too many of us again many people will raise their eyes but again talking about energy solutions without talking about the population problems just like mopping the floor with the faucets running on so that is 1 problem
4921474 the big inputs are fertilizers and processing of the grain
4921475 so if you look at this a consumption for 300 million people living in the united states over one year all of us consume about 1 exajoule of energy that is what we eat that is 1 followed by 18 zeros okay now as a country as a society we form a super organism of all of us together and then we become different beings and we use 105 exajoules per year of energy in other words we use 105 times more energy as a society than we need to live so if you compare a human heart as an individual you have to imagine let us say a v tec honda engine a 6 cylinder engine as a member of our society so we are two different beings one a biological human being and another one an industrialized member of a very large society that consumes a lot of energy at a very high rate okay that is the most fundamental point that i would really like people to think of that you use 100 watts as a human being but you use 11 000 watts continuously as an american

4921481 no no pasturized you know pasturized like bottle of milk
4921482 ok i know that you dont want to break the 4th wall here that this is an actual functioning old time y spagetti factory but could you go in back and ask someone or even just look at the box that the cheese comes in and come back tell us if the word pasturized is there

4921487 because im not sure im going to err on the side of caution
4921488 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
4921489 just because she brought the right fares and studied the routes a little bit doesnt mean much
4921490 i can remember standing in the rain waiting for a bus
4921491 i know what its like to miss a bus and wait 45 minutes for the next one
4921492 when im mayor were going to get people to where they need to be on time in a clean reliable and comfortable bus ill put the dignity in mass transit
4921493 it has been three hours can you imagine having a sick child and having to use the bus to get here from southeast or southwest fresno
4921494 getting more 15 minute routes has been the priority now were ready to take step 2 which is brt
4921495 but i have experience building coalitions around fresh ideas and ill do that so light rail can happen in the future
4921496 its a large revenue source for us to develop mass transit
4921497 you will have people saying they are going to keep fighting their roosters
4921498 people who have been in it forever and forever will stay in it
4921499 of course the context makes the difference i had a misunderstanding in a park once
4921500 i soon began to perceive the resemblance of the feejeeans to labillardieres portraits of new caledonians and a further acquaintance with the people presented novelty at every step
4921501 sanitation director veronica white whose department oversees city authorized teardowns said in an e mail that demolition program managers are supposed to forward stop demolition orders to contractors assigned to bulldoze houses
4921502 i will have to further investigate where the disconnect took place before i can comment
4921503 its been steady never too busy but this was a dry run
4921504 weve been hearing things like were so glad youre in aiken this tastes wonderful nice variety we sold out of some varieties
4921505 these are great im not northern but i do like a good bagel
4921506 i think with a little coordination anythings possible we work on a team concept we all help each other here
4921507 weve been working on this idea for a couple of years and weve been getting the store ready here for about two months
4921508 we took a road trip all around canada and the united states
4921509 we looked around and saw that there was no bagel store here
4921510 we feel aiken is an up and coming area and since it had no bagel stores we decided to open one
4921511 is he really devoted to the issues of regular people
4921512 is he still the millworkers son or has he been captured by the fruits of his wealth
4921513 the fundamental problem with the n amp o and edwards relationship was edwards thought his hometown paper should be supportive of his candidacy
4921514 lately ive been really interested in fashion and i like to make binders and slideshows of high fashion modeling and designs
4921515 i just kind of wanted to document my outfits and it was just a random thing that wasnt in relation to anything
4921516 parents have no idea what their kids are doing online
4921517 i share a lot of information to people i guess more than i probably should but i just felt that i didnt want the people who are very close to me reading it because i guess im embarrassed about my writing sometimes
4921518 i believe its a great outlet if youre older and more mature but you are opening yourself up to the world and you have to be prepared for that
4921519 i personally feel that its not safe to have a child whos 12 or 13 have a blog and i wouldnt want my kids to do that
4921520 are you posing in a more provocative way is it how you want to be remembered when your next boyfriend sees it or your future mother in law sees it or your tuition scholarship persons going to review you for dartmouth
4921521 i felt like i had to protect the identity of people who dont know or arent aware of the blog
4921522 anyone who actually believes she is 12 is an absolute idoit sic
4921523 she slept in the bed with us that night to get back to sleep
4921524 she woke up and again woke us up and said and this is really heartbreaking i just woke up crying and i dont even know why im crying
4921525 whoever may comment and whatever feedback you may get girls are very impressionable especially girls in this age that were talking about
4921526 kai has blood all over and po po maternal grandma was holding kai
4921527 mummy kai wants to go to thomas shall we do that
4921528 basically these girls compete year round for every major event they need new sails
4921529 were the official sailmaker to the olympics as far as service goes
4921530 there is an exact measurement to all of those sails right down to a millimeter if they get damaged or need to be adjusted they take them to the loft
4921531 for every olympic champion there is also some person who almost made it
4921532 once they catch their break and start sailing again in six months theyll want the sails the champion used
4921533 we have sails that weigh 4 000 pounds it helps to be on the ground floor
4921534 we see entrepreneurship as a vehicle for families to bridge financial gaps
4921535 a good cultural fit in our expansion to western massachusetts
4921536 being promoted to bbc one and gaining a wider audience
4921537 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4921538 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4921539 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4921540 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4921541 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4921542 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4921543 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen
4921544 as soon as we became aware of deaths due to misprescribing for pain patients we began the process of instituting label changes
4921545 i dont think a drug that requires such a level of sophistication to use is what id call cheap because of the risks
4921546 given the medicines he was on his brain forgot to tell his heart to beat and his lungs to pump
4921547 i never had any idea of the risk nor did my husband
4921548 we know that a significant share of the methadone deaths involve doctors making well intended prescriptions
4921549 methadone can be important for patients when other drugs dont work
4921550 but unless the doctor has the training and resources to manage the patient properly hes going to get in trouble at a rate thats unacceptable
4921551 i am not sure why i have not been signed
4921552 maybe ucf will let me throw some balls during practice
4921553 hey i saw you on television or at least i think it was you you were gone in a second
4921554 im not interested in a vice president who i send off to go to funerals
4921555 i want somebody who is going to roll up their sleeves and be willing to work
4921556 i am aware of the enhanced importance of this issue given my age
4921557 talk has since faded with clinton seen as a symptom of the
4921558 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4921559 i cannot be in a room with a latex glove
4921560 people talk of global warming but dont go out and do anything about it
4921561 i only plant trees that are strong have long life provide shade and are useful to society they should impede neither traffic nor pedestrians
4921562 just planting a tree and taking a photo with it is a very immature act if you want to grow a useful healthy tree you need to be willing to spend rs 1 500 to rs 2 000 per tree and two to three years tending to it till it becomes stable and strong
4921563 you have to examine the soil prepare the hole and only then plant a sapling
4921564 we made many mistakes and spent a lot of money before we learnt the right way to grow healthy trees
4921565 you can learn a lot from just growing one tree i always say trees are the best friend of man but man is the worst enemy of trees
4921566 people from adyar and tiruvanmiyur who are travelling to puducherry cuddalore and further south had to go all the way to the north of the city to koyambedu to get their bus that made no sense wasting all that fuel and time
4921567 this reduces traffic congestion and fuel use and also saves time
4921568 i believe you should go out and do what you can rather than just complain or tell other people how to do the job he says
4921569 as far as i know my grandmother never saw doctor who but i am sure she would have been intrigued excited and above all flattered

4921573 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4921574 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4921575 an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind
4921576 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4921577 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4921578 i was walking down the street wearing glasses when the prescription ran out
4921579 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4921580 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4921581 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4921582 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4921583 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4921584 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4921585 how many years between those warmings sic again not a suv oil rig or evil american empire to be found man cannot control or impact climate change many scientists agree
4921586 in february we looked and said every municipal bond is going to go bad
4921587 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
4921588 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
4921589 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4921590 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4921591 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4921592 responsible for the oversight and management of all departmental operations expanding the positions role to managing program delivery
4921593 i shudder to think what will happen if we dont move aggressively to build those firebreaks remove those dead and dying trees and clean out as much underbrush as possible
4921594 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4921595 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4921596 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4921597 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4921598 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4921599 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4921600 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4921601 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4921602 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4921603 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4921604 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4921605 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4921606 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4921607 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4921608 i think perhaps we will need a stiff drink after that
4921609 i have in the last few months become more pessimistic than the consensus
4921610 im not someone who sees things in a bleak way
4921611 i have more concerns about potential risks and vulnerabilities than most people
4921612 its a mix of skills that rarely comes packaged in one person
4921613 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4921614 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4921615 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4921616 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
4921617 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
4921618 there are great champions in the squad who act as pace setters to pull everyone else along with them
4921619 we will try to spend the whole season towards the top of the table and impress in every competition
4921620 taiga is disturbing kai kai cannot sleep daddy bring taiga down kai will sleep with mummy
4921621 when kai was a baby kai liked xxx kai did xxx
4921622 pointing somewhere high up mummy look there there is a fire
4921623 taiga dont cry just say thank you or sorry to mummy
4921624 do i need to be seated or can i just choose a table
4921625 probably but not right away im meeting some friends in a few minutes and i want to have a drink while i wait
4921626 in that case maam you may have a seat anywhere in the bar area and i will seat you properly once your friends arrive
4921627 i need something wimpy i havent eaten yet how about a baileys on the rocks
4921628 may i start a tab some friends will be joining me soon
4921629 of course maam would you like me to just charge it to your room
4921630 should i be doing this why am i doing this what if something goes wrong how much danger am i in
4921631 i didnt even know i was doing it i love music
4921632 is it okay if we take it back to the room
4921633 i did oh well maybe we can just um go to the room now and come back to eat once erin gets here
4921634 the goal is to have this be my full time job and make enough to live
4921635 buying businesses for themselves moving west or to europe including russia or to dubai
4921636 theyre also moving totally outside what they do buying a retail store or a ranch
4921637 the job market is in the worst most chaotic state ive ever seen it in fixed income
4921638 ive been doing this for over 30 years and ive never seen anything like this
4921639 the structured finance market is so bleak right now it makes sense for us to focus our energies on this
4921640 its refreshing to not have to worry about whether i am going to have a job next week
4921641 the biggest thing that i enjoy is being the jack of all trades of having my own business
4921642 its hard to say if things were going well would i have left
4921643 it didnt look like the industry would be any fun for the next few years
4921644 i know a few guys that started gambling playing poker to pay the bills
4921645 the only places to turn are hedge funds and boutique banks ive never been unemployed this long
4921646 en ning n momento se pens en la militarizaci n el gobierno descarta esta posibilidad y controlar el orden con la instituci n que corresponde
4921647 yo pregunto a los ciudadanos si no es la polic a quien se encargar de controlar la delincuencia
4921648 felizmente no prosper pues se trata de una instituci n fundamental de la patria que tiene una estructura y un mando nico nacional
4921649 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4921650 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4921651 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4921652 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4921653 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4921654 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4921655 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4921656 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4921657 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4921658 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4921659 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4921660 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4921661 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4921662 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4921663 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4921664 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4921665 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4921666 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4921667 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4921668 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4921669 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4921670 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4921671 i cant believe you dont realize how rude youre being
4921672 tom i wanted to talk to you about something that id like to resolve together on several occasions ive noticed that when im on the phone youll wait patiently until im finished unfortunately for me when i see you there i lose my focus with the person im talking to it really can be disconcerting for me i was hoping we might come up with a system so that you dont have to wait while i finish my conversation does that make sense to you
4921673 theres a lot of quality control that goes into a montblanc
4921674 that white star is a status symbol in the pen writing world if you have it in your front jacket pocket whoever youre with will look at it and see and know
4921675 personally i like a pen with a little bit of a heft a nice weight to it
4921676 if i had 1 500 i would probably still buy the montblanc
4921677 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4921678 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4921679 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4921680 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4921681 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4921682 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4921683 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4921684 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4921685 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4921686 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful

4921694 our cost of operations will begin to go down due to the economies of scale of being a member of a large group a big global player as we negotiate better and pay less for equipment and other resources for example the ultra low cost handsets which we launched a few months ago the worlds first 20 handset could not have been possible without the power of zain

4921700 many estimates are that theres possibly another half trillion dollars of that to come to account
4921701 we are not really going to see a significant level of confidence build up in markets until we get through probably a couple of quarters of non surprises
4921702 if you look at the performance over the year its been a pretty solid one
4921703 global funding has been a real issue so theres been quite a significant increase in funding costs
4921704 looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month

4921712 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4921713 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics

4921718 you can be more colloquial in how you choose your words and your voice but the speed to market and the power of this new medium is such that we might not be doing enough yoga breathing or taking enough care with what were putting up
4921719 this is comparable to hanging out with gutenberg inventor of movable type printing in the 14th century

4921727 gates has earned our ear and for many of us our respect largely because he succeeded so convincingly playing the game of market capitalism given gates achievements it is interesting that he is throwing down a gauntlet to have global capitalism direct itself toward social contribution as well as financial gain it is also important

4921731 we apologize for any inconvenience apologies of no substance and when the very poor service is costing the customer more it becomes a situation where by contract one is held in as ituation that is a conflict of interests the interests of the customer are nil and void and the greedy interests of the corp
4921732 the current price movement is reflecting some expectation on the part of investors and more importantly the lack of demand for the stock at present
4921733 if the batu price continues downwards it erodes shareholder value and for those investors who bought at 1400 they would be in a loss position
4921734 dfcu seems to have grown to its max price potential especially for short term investors unless it can spell out new growth in the half year 2008 results as other banks have the bank has created new lucrative products land loans and is opening new branches but this is yet to be seen in the numbers

4921736 we tired in the last 15 to 20 minutes which is something i should take responsibility for we should have had some tougher games in pre season
4921737 for all the hard work the number of goals scored in the last 15 minutes is huge and the other 75 minutes goes out of the window
4921738 it was just one moment thats all were talking about but thats the beauty of the premier league i cant complain because ive been on the other side of it
4921739 you could see the team was really focused we want to concentrate on winning and the best news for our supporters is to win games
4921740 in the first half they were attacking the second half we were on top and attacking and continued until the end
4921741 we had chances torres is a key player and he can change games for the team its really important to have these sorts of players
4921742 i think there is not enough understanding of the fact that in a democracy how you treat the security of the minority must be an important part of its success
4921743 you cant make only token gestures and actually let them be in the state that they are as the rajinder sachar committee report shows so what happens is that token gestures are made but real issues are never addressed
4921744 ive been raised in a very liberal bohemian family in which religion has not played any part at all for me being a muslim really was about urdu about eating biryani and wearing shararas on id so the cultural aspect of me was muslim otherwise because i am not religious the religion did not matter after the riots following the babri masjid demolition i suddenly had people saying you are a muslim and hurling it as an accusation it was a self consciousness that i have never before experienced what it made me do is say yes i am muslim and what do you want to do about it that i can say is increasingly happening particularly in the western world a lot of young kids today are wearing the burqa are taking on an identity which really they dont feel just because when you push somebody against the wall thats what they come up with
4921745 a leader for muslims and thats the way it should be
4921746 you look at all the politicians whether it is atal bihari vajpayee whether it is indira gandhi whether it is anybody the minute it is a muslim question you will get the dariwaralas and only all the maulvis to speak
4921747 yes and if our politicians havent woken up to it yet they really dont know whats happening
4921748 the indian muslims were in a safer place because the indian muslim has a stake and space in indian democracy
4921749 this is very unfortunate when this happens and we do empathize with the customer

4921759 well i think to the consumer who is in the supermarket or in a delicatessen shopping for that product and they see that the product has achieved a gold medal at the royal hobart fine food awards then its an indication that its a top product and it its a reason to purchase
4921760 as a result of the above items the company expects headline earnings and attributable earnings per share to be between 85 and 95 below those reported for the prior corresponding period being the six months to 30 june 2007
4921761 performance of the investment portfolio has been under pressure during the six months although the higher interest rates had a positive impact on cash related investments the equity portfolio performed significantly below the exceptional performance in the first half of 2007 especially due to a severe reduction in the value of financial and industrial stocks

4921767 we have a specialised product and we still offer great value
4921768 the fact that city lodges occupancy levels are above 80 when the global industry average is 60 is testament that people want us to build more hotels we also have four brands with different price points which allows us to build them next to each other as we have done at or tambo international airport

4921772 it recently became obvious that while there has been progress on the software side theres another problem with infringement of published content
4921773 its just so easy to copy and forward information that people do it without thinking
4921774 knowledge networks disseminated copies of relevant newspaper and magazine articles in the good faith belief that it was lawful to do so
4921775 we now understand that that practice may violate the copyright rights of those publications we regret that those violations may have occurred and we are pleased that this matter has now been resolved
4921776 were hoping that this program and this case can serve an educational function

4921793 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4921794 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4921795 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4921796 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4921797 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4921798 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4921799 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4921800 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4921801 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4921802 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4921803 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4921804 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4921805 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4921806 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4921807 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4921808 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4921809 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4921810 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4921811 al tama o que ha llegado la industria comienzo a cuestionarme si no ser mejor consolidar lo que tenemos y no estar en una carrera permanente de crecimiento el mensaje que nos mand la naturaleza con las enfermedades me lleva a preguntarme si es el momento de ordenar lo que tenemos y tener un crecimiento m s sustentable en el tiempo
4921812 la industria deber a seguir creciendo a tasas cercanas al 10 por ciento y duplicar su tama o en las zonas donde no es tan grande como en las regiones xi y xii
4921813 jos huenchunao exige ser trasladado de inmediato desde la c rcel de angol a un centro de eduaci n y trabajo lugar en el que pueda desarrollar trabajo agr colas y permanecer en condiciones de dignidad inherentes a su condici n de preso pol tico comunero mapuche
4921814 jos huenchunao tiene pendiente una acci n contra el estado chileno ante la comisi n interamericana de derechos humanos por haber sido condenado por la ley antiterrorista mediante una sentencia dictada con infracci n al debido proceso esencialmente racista y verdadero postulado ideol gico en contra de las leg timas acciones de recuperaci n de derechos por parte del pueblo mapuche
4921815 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados

4921836 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4921837 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4921838 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4921839 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

4921883 a record of sorts was created when the one rupee coin of mintage 1960 went under the hammer for rs 220 000 the coin is rarest of the rare as it never came into circulation
4921884 considering its rarity we were expecting a record prize thats why the cut off price for the bid was fixed at rs 200 000
4921885 the coin which fascinated everyone otherwise looks ordinary though its design is quite different with sou naye paise inscribed on top portion
4921886 but it the coin never got the approval of senior officers for circulation the reason behind the objection might have been the design after its disapproval the coin might have remained with an officer before it passed into the hands of a numismatist
4921887 the exhibition has brought together a spectrum of indian coinage and banknotes connoisseurs had a wonderful opportunity to see gold coins 2 200 years old
4921888 we have crashed through red lights slipped through stop signs driven over the speed limit

4921900 we know each other were friends were about the same age we both have young kids we both like sports we made that trip to iraq in 2006
4921901 you know you get to know somebody when youre traveling in the belly of a c 130 or lifting off in a blackhawk for somewhere like fallujah or kirkuk were the same generation so we have a comfort level but i dont want to overstate any of that i like him i hope he likes me

4921904 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4921905 its something i never thought would happen but it was something i put my mind to and i wanted to do something no one else had done in sport
4921906 this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing the sport of swimming but without the help of my relay team this wouldnt have been possible
4921907 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned something that helped me

4921909 try some new events and just see what happens with them
4921910 there is still a significant amount of cdo collateralised debt obligation instruments out there that are still to be brought to account

4921912 we are not really going to see a significant level of confidence build up in markets until we get through probably a couple of quarters of non surprises
4921913 if you look at the performance over the year its been a pretty solid one
4921914 global funding has been a real issue so theres been quite a significant increase in funding costs
4921915 looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4921916 those banks that have taken a more cautious or a more prudent approach in their lending are seeing the benefits of that
4921917 the business is a good business but it does have a number of complex parts
4921918 when you look the funding requirements theres a significant capital injection that would have to be made in order to appropriately capitalise the entity
4921919 the clarity over the past year has improved by at least 2 5 feet
4921920 i know what fire does and with global warming and the water issues we have fire looms its ugly head much more formidably than it has in the past
4921921 by specifying brembo brakes we are sending a strong message about the performance capabilities of the genesis coupe
4921922 among car aficionados brembos oversized calliper design is recognized as one of the hallmarks of a high performance car they grab attention and will force people to take a second closer look at the genesis coupe
4921923 part of my contract was getting invited to spring training but its not like i earned it

4921940 thats an all time high for optical scan usage in this nation
4921941 electronic system usage will go down in 2008 for the first time since we started collecting data in 1980
4921942 we studied these systems and all the systems in use in ohio and the most vulnerable to risk are the touch screen voting machines
4921943 there have been no votes lost just votes that are missed and hours later or days later recovered
4921944 we are in fact in compliance with the terms of the contracts
4921945 if theres a machine failure or a power outage or some kind of misprogramming with the machines it will enable people to keep voting
4921946 what has happened since florida 2000 is weve taken a problem that was a disaster for that election and made it exponentially worse
4921947 these machines cannot be trusted for the counting and recording of our votes
4921948 computer scientists around the country have demonstrated that in less than 60 seconds one of these machines can be broken into and can infect the entire system on which people are voting
4921949 touch screen voting machines have proven to be accurate reliable and secure time and time again
4921950 it is important to note that successful elections necessitate people processes and the technology all working together
4921951 anytime there has been a change in voting equipment there have been some some doubts and concerns which lessen over time due to familiarity with the new equipment
4921952 if all you have is the electronic memory you can reprint that electronic memory as many times as you want its going to say exactly the same thing and you wont know whether its right
4921953 more than a third of the voters in this country will be voting in an unverifiable way
4921954 without an audit without the ability to audit it will be unreliable and without paper record you cant really audit
4921955 this is the central act of democracy it is the basis for the all the legitimacy of our government and its actions we believe or at least want to believe that people are put in office by the will of the voters thats what you need to be able to verify
4921956 john mccain is going to own the george bush economy around his neck in this election he was central to its architecture he was one of its fiercest defenders in america florida has lost more jobs over the last year than any other state in the country
4921957 it doesnt take much if our supporters are turning out at a rate of 74 percent 75 percent 78 percent and mccains are turning out at 68 70 72 that doesnt seem like a big deal but it is the whole ball game
4921958 bush had an advantage over kerry because of their intensity we think mccain is going to have trouble replicating bush in 2004
4921959 we dont take florida for granted but we do have a good history here even though were outnumbered in this state our voter turnout effort has been extremely good in florida
4921960 florida once again is the epicenter of the political universe were very confident that florida continues to trend as republican going back to jeb bush mel martinez charlie crist of course the president bush elections weve got a good mature organization on the ground

4921968 i always pitch for my family thats why im playing to help support them
4921969 youre tired and youre all those things but to be able to do that a day after having a baby is really special you get a little bit extra when youre in a situation like that
4921970 a key statistical procedure on which many past epidemiological studies had relied was flawed
4921971 emissions of smog producing pollutants decreased both nationally and regionally between 1990 and 2000
4921972 both decreased substantially nationally and regionally with statistically significant downward trends nationally no levels in 2005 were about 50 lower than in 1991 and no2 about 30 lower
4921973 one million to die from smog related illnesses in the next two years
4921974 the most problematic aspect of the cmas research is the assumption that air pollution kills
4921975 dr paul is non interventionist and does not want us intervening in the affairs of others
4921976 its certainly good to have attention drawn to the issues of the libertarian party
4921977 being a third party candidate is very different a lot of republicans like to donate to republicans you just have to keep on plugging
4921978 it could be that a few thousand votes tip the balance
4921979 a plan has been hatched to liquidate me and the governor by hired killers because we put in danger the lucrative illegal business of prominent people who are behind the illegal logging activities in the province
4921980 i truly believe that the florida division of elections every decision that came from their office favored bush

4921985 my dad was known here having played for the patriots and my grandfather was definitely known having played with the bruins and i felt i should get closer to mom
4921986 weve had a relationship but not really a son mother relationship like normal kids have that was one of my main reasons for coming here my mom plus i loved it here when i visited i really liked the guys on the team it felt comfortable
4921987 its been a really really nice experience for both of us
4921988 hes in camp now so thats kind of like lockdown but before that i got to see him a lot at least twice a week wed do dinner and a movie im loving having him here when he was away in florida i didnt get to see him as much so were making up for lost time
4921989 i dont see him enough because they keep him so darn busy over there but hes a nice young man man and im pretty proud of him thats for sure
4921990 all he thinks about is playing football but thats the way i was when i was playing hockey
4921991 the fact that this event is even taking place is significant
4921992 it could provide an opportunity for barack obama to make some inroads but i think youll see john mccain stressing his conservative credentials
4921993 usually they go republican the fact that obama is in there with a chance of maybe getting a share of that vote is in some respects a great triumph for him
4921994 to be perfectly blunt its hard to imagine al gore or john kerry doing very well at this kind of a forum but barack obama speaks very movingly about issues of faith and values
4921995 global warming obesity and heart disease all figments of al gores imagination

4922001 the famed beijing duck is a hot gold medal contender for the most popular food in the host city of the ongoing olympic games
4922002 the skin is very thin and very crispy their sauce is not too salty or too sweet one bite and the oily duck juice spurts into your mouth
4922003 its the best representation of our country you have to climb the great wall you have to go to a hutong traditional alleyway you have to buy silk and you have to eat peking roast duck
4922004 its the most authentic its taste is different from all the others
4922005 why am i the first kinnock in a thousand generations to go to university

4922023 in order to attract votes the harper government has combined tax cuts with big spending the effect being to suck the treasury dry
4922024 there are many credible members of the scientific community who have questioned the theory of global warming and now we have some scientists actually suggesting the earths temperatures may be entering a period of dramatic cooling

4922030 we have in this country an overabundance of supply of health care services
4922031 so as we look to find ways to help stem the increase in cost associated with medical benefits we have to realize thats money coming out of revenue for a provider of care

4922068 liquor is allowed by their religion so we allow them
4922069 we have to understand the political reality that we are part of an alliance and we do not have absolute power so under such a government we focus on universal islamic values like fighting corruption
4922070 for starters states under the opposition alliance can reduce the number of gambling premises as gambling is strictly prohibited by all religions
4922071 permits or licences to sell alcohol should either be limited or only allowed for areas inhabited by non muslims

4922077 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4922078 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4922079 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion

4922097 i think people are going to be using it extensively now that its sort of been proven to be a reliable measurement
4922098 the benefits of this technology are significant improved exploration efficiency and performance as well as reductions in risk and finding costs i am confident that in a few years all oil companies will be using this technology
4922099 this is not something to replace seismology its something to augment seismology
4922100 you always regret drilling a hole that you get nothing out of
4922101 but also these days there are lots and lots of environmental questions the fewer holes you drill especially in deep water and in environmentally sensitive areas the better

4922109 norway has so much expertise and the opportunities are here so the people have been coming over here
4922110 basically in norway the energy industry touches almost every industry
4922111 i was asked if i wanted to go here i didnt have to think twice
4922112 the church is a cultural a social and a spiritual center for norwegians in the houston area
4922113 this is an indication how important we feel houston is for norway

4922115 bank of americas executives cant even articulate what the total liabilities from this deal are
4922116 allegations in the lawsuit and the company will vigorously defend itself
4922117 this is exactly the situation that the fdic wanted to avoid with the marriage of bank of america and countrywide
4922118 today we face strong opposition and their weapon primarily is the press
4922119 its a temporary problem and ultimately the truth will prevail
4922120 summer is a good time to get all this stuff done in preparation for the fall
4922121 a mistake so many business people make is they wait until sept 1 to really gear up theyre really short shrifting themselves
4922122 you wouldnt communicate with an employee here the same as you would with someone in africa or asia
4922123 at the same time you have to align everything you do with your employees before you can expect the general public to have a clear idea of what you stand for
4922124 our biggest challenge is showing companies they dont so much own a brand as manage it
4922125 people are going to make an association with your brand no matter what either good or bad its up to you to make sure youve gotten everything together internally before you take anything to the outside
4922126 you cant just set it in motion and let it go you need to fine tune it as circumstances change as your competition changes so youre never done building your brand
4922127 you wouldnt communicate over the web the same way you would with a billboard
4922128 there are a lot more platforms out there for companies to use but you cant just take something designed for one channel and apply it to another
4922129 sometimes just by being consistent you can set yourself apart
4922130 look with oil more than 100 a barrel getting new employees or attracting new clients isnt really a problem
4922131 the problem is how do you keep your employees how do you lower the attrition of clients to make sure your business is always growing
4922132 last spring we worked with them over the course of about four months interviewing dozens of students but also talking to alumna faculty and staff
4922133 we wanted to find out if our brand our image reflects the quality of the school
4922134 the days of companies writing a graphic standards manual and sitting back are over
4922135 old school methods of even 10 years ago have gone away our industrys had to shift because the world has shifted
4922136 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4922137 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4922138 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4922139 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4922140 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4922141 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4922142 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4922143 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4922144 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4922145 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4922146 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4922147 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4922148 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4922149 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4922150 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4922151 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream
4922152 too many good docs are getting out of the business too many ob gyns arent able to practise their love with women all across this country
4922153 shit its cheney he scares the crap out of me
4922154 ill handle that in a minute but right now i want to hear what happens with the duck

4922158 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4922159 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4922160 the war was my fault 9 11 was my fault anytime something bad happens a new death toll in the war or whatever my e mails start getting filled up again
4922161 i understand why people care but its like weve got to move on
4922162 i guess you can guess who im not endorsing not supporting
4922163 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4922164 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
4922165 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
4922166 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
4922167 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
4922168 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
4922169 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
4922170 all of the sudden it seems like the bottom fell out
4922171 its very difficult to make a bullish argument for gold

4922176 why i rejected christianity a former apologist explains by john w loftu en espa ol
4922177 where opponents are large organised like armies and occupy territory military methods are likely to be more effective
4922178 now you and i both know that theres a homophobia problem in the black community
4922179 blacks appear to be more likely than whites both to see homosexuality as wrong and to favor gay rights laws
4922180 with no close second the most supportive group for gays and lesbians
4922181 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4922182 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4922183 we need cleaner forms of energy and we need them fast
4922184 40 of the mass of every tree in the forest is crude oil
4922185 when im doing my tricks my hair doesnt whack me in the face
4922186 i have so many women who cut their hair to fit into a ponytail and what happens is that they all look the same instead of having a style
4922187 it drives me crazy these are the same people who say i look terrible in short hair well im looking at you in a ponytail and you have short hair
4922188 if you want to wear a ponytail just grab a little piece of hair from underneath wrap it around the elastic bobby pin it and give it some style
4922189 pull your hair back throw your chin to the ceiling and pull it back again
4922190 hey wait a sec cant i still plug this old 5 radio shack corded phone from 1987 into the wall and have it work just dandy because it required almost no electricity at all sure i can
4922191 thank god im caught up but theres no wicked awesome screen caps because my laptop died and i ordered a new one and somebody cancelled the fucker before it ever made its way to my hands therefore robbing you your first look at the newly recast noah newman and batshit crazy chloe who ive grown to love
4922192 perhaps the flowers would be carried away to some far away place where a chile would see them and be inspired to pursue art
4922193 thank god im caught up but theres no wicked awesome screen caps because my laptop died and i ordered a new one and somebody cancelled the fucker before it ever made its way to my hands therefore robbing you your first look at the newly recast noah newman and batshit crazy chloe who ive grown to love
4922194 i pray that this is the last we have to hear about art
4922195 more random musings from a big ol reality television lovin faggot
4922196 i pray that this is the last we have to hear about art
4922197 well he entered the game still listed as a tri starter but he is so far removed from this contest he might as well be playing fullback
4922198 an anonymous secondhand quotation from sen barack obama at a closed house democratic caucus meeting on july 29 caused an uproar among partisans it is an excellent example of how the pernicious use of unnamed sources so pervasive in washington can backfire on journalists and sources
4922199 this is the moment that the world is waiting for i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
4922200 in response to what one of the house members prefaced the question by
4922201 said i wish i could take credit for that but i cant because its not about me its about america its about the people of germany and the people of europe looking for a new hope new relationships as we go forward in the world so he expressly said that its not about me
4922202 lots of people are reading the quote about obama being a symbol and getting it wrong his entire point of that riff was that the campaign is not about him
4922203 the post left out the important first half of the sentence which was something along the lines of it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all
4922204 it has become increasingly clear in my travel the campaign that the crowds the enthusiasm 200 000 people in berlin is not about me at all its about america i have just become a symbol
4922205 anonymous quotes should be used sparingly this one wasnt worth it if you werent there be careful about judging the context
4922206 i have become the symbol of america returning to our best traditions
4922207 it scared me to see how the mainstream media were propping up george bush while faithfully reporting every stupid lie that the bush campaign made up about al gore
4922208 ill use every talent i possess and all my energy to try to bring back tolerance decency and generosity to the country i love
4922209 employees here dont know where hell get the ethanol there are only gas pumps here
4922210 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4922211 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4922212 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4922213 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4922214 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4922215 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4922216 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4922217 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4922218 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4922219 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4922220 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4922221 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4922222 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4922223 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4922224 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4922225 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4922226 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4922227 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4922228 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4922229 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4922230 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4922231 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4922232 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4922233 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4922234 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4922235 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4922236 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4922237 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4922238 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4922239 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4922240 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4922241 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4922242 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4922243 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4922244 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4922245 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4922246 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4922247 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4922248 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4922249 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4922250 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4922251 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4922252 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4922253 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4922254 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4922255 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4922256 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4922257 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4922258 kaz has had problems with his back and its not getting any better
4922259 in a couple of weeks hell be ready to come back and help us
4922260 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4922261 hes a righthanded hitter specifically were going to face some pretty tough lefthanders pretty quickly hell be a guy that can help us either catching playing first base possibly third base and being a pinch hitter off the bench
4922262 primarily catching and dh ing and playing first which is primarily what he would do here
4922263 maybe a third base stint here or there primarily probably catch pinch hit maybe some first base in the right situation where wed give lance a little break or something but he swings a bat and is hitting well there we need another option there thats righthanded
4922264 the larger theme is how environmentalism seems to harm the poorest people in the poorest places on the planet
4922265 its looking at how the hysteria around global warming will affect people on low or fixed incomes it asks is there a disease and is the cure worse than the disease the science isnt settled global warming was invented five or 10 years ago
4922266 the film al gore and hollywood dont want you to see
4922267 i dont think it would be a bad thing for this earth to warm up
4922268 greenpeaces claims are based on science and the science is very clear the latest report from the uns leading scientists says that climate change is happening human activity is causing it and its a huge threat to our species
4922269 but we can prevent the worst if we act immediately to slash emissions and kickstart an energy revolution with a massive expansion of renewables and improvements in energy efficiency
4922270 despise ryanair because it used to be that we with our own sort whereas i see ryanair as making ireland wealthy they see it as a negative for ireland
4922271 obama telling us not to drive suvs and al gore saying that you cant use air conditioning
4922272 in my mind and in my heart im very happy my customers enjoy my food
4922273 most of the menu comes from things that we like and that i was missing
4922274 thats what new orleans is all about a little bit of everything for everybody
4922275 we just wanted it to feel different from anyplace else

4922279 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4922280 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4922281 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4922282 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4922283 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4922284 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4922285 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4922293 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4922294 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4922295 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4922296 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4922297 this witch hunt against the great global warming swindle has failed utterly to discredit it discrediting instead the accusers
4922298 there is something odd about the ferocious amount of energy expended suppressing any dissent from orthodoxy on climate change if their case is so good why try so fervently to extinguish other points of view
4922299 we are pleased to note ofcom has vindicated the ipccs claim against channel 4 in spirit and in substance
4922300 it is entirely appropriate people should bear a cost if only of unpopularity and criticism for speaking freely however the cost should be reasonable and not disproportionate there should not be in the words of a famous supreme court decision a chilling effect on free speech
4922301 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4922302 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4922303 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4922304 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4922305 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4922306 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4922307 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4922308 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4922309 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4922310 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4922311 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4922312 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4922313 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4922314 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4922315 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4922316 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4922317 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4922318 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it

4922320 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4922321 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4922322 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4922323 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4922324 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4922325 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4922326 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems

4922337 i am now here spreading the word about the climate project and what we can do in india and elsewhere to help
4922338 we are expected to give 10 inconvenient truth presentations within a year
4922339 the reason why the global warming message is a success is that ordinary people are involved in it who are spreading the word
4922340 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4922341 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality

4922347 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4922348 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4922349 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4922350 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4922351 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4922352 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4922353 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4922354 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4922355 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4922356 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4922357 who are open to doing something on the production side
4922358 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4922359 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4922360 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4922361 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4922362 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4922363 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4922364 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4922365 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4922366 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4922367 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4922368 those that refuse to learn from history are doomed to repeat it
4922369 hun this is the best omelette ever spicy and enak
4922370 steering the course of grp milf peace negotiations for the sake of us interests
4922371 in 2003 the us state department engaged the usip to facilitate a peace agreement between the grp and the milf
4922372 despite the challenges usip managed to build productive relationships with both the grp and milf helped the parties come up with creative solutions to stubborn issues of ancestral domain and started dialogue between disparate moro ethnic groups through its activities usip introduced concepts and approaches that were useful to both government and milf peace panels
4922373 the usip advocated an ancestral domain arrangement that would remain friendly with u s interests
4922374 it is interested solely or mainly in advancing u s interests amidst conditions of armed conflict it merely pretends to facilitate the grp milf peace negotiations when its sees big advantages in doing so
4922375 todays complex diplomatic landscape increasingly requires new tools and techniques of conflict management including quasi and nongovernmental actors to accomplish u s foreign policy goals because of its ability to deal with non state actors and sensitive issues underlying civil conflict usip can be a useful instrument for advancing u s interests
4922376 the filipino people know that the u s covets the oil and other natural resources of mindanao and wants to establish u s military bases there to protect u s imperial interests
4922377 arroyo and her subalterns must be investigated and held accountable for their actions
4922378 to encourage a renewed grp wide effort to conclude an equitable settlement with the moros
4922379 the arroyo government is guilty of allowing such brazen intervention
4922380 arroyo and u s interests likely intersected on the issue of charter change and the prospect of u s investments in mindanao
4922381 the arroyo government pounced on the opening for cha cha as an opportunity to advance its own self serving agenda of term extension
4922382 like millions of filipinos we want to watch the reunion concert but when we look for ways to get the tickets we are redirected to www marlboro ph this is clearly tantamount to advertising
4922383 philip morris sought to gloss over any likely illegality which may arise from its sponsorship of the event by calling the reunion a promotional event not open to the general public but restricted to trade partners and adult smokers who have to obtain an invitation by registering in marlboros website
4922384 mere play of words a marketing ploy that circumvents the law
4922385 cigarette and tobacco companies from sponsoring any sport concert cultural or art event as well as individual and team athletes artists or performers where such sponsorship shall require or involve the advertisement or promotion of any cigarette or tobacco company tobacco product or tobacco use
4922386 advertisement is likewise prevalent in the manner by which philip morris has aggressively used viral marketing to induce eraserheads fans to register on its marlboro website to obtain invitations to the event
4922387 any visual and or audible message disseminated to the public about or on a particular product that promote and give publicity by words design images or any other means through electronic form of mass media
4922388 the manner by which pmi has utilized the electronic media to stir interest and create hype about this event lure both smokers and non smokers alike to its website with the expectation of obtaining an invitation thereby creating much publicity and getting electronic media mileage about marlboro its product name is nothing but plain and simple out and out advertisement
4922389 the business of conceptualizing presenting making available and communicating to the public through any form of mass media any fact data or information about the attributes features quality or availability of consumer products services or credit
4922390 the act alone of making the concert accessible and free only to smokers philip morris is actually promoting smoking
4922391 the concert is like a carrot at the end of the stick the price for smoking
4922392 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4922393 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4922394 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4922395 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4922396 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4922397 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4922398 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4922399 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4922400 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4922401 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4922402 i know that i dont walk alone and i know that if i can get myself out of the way that i can maybe carry out in some small way what he intends
4922403 we still dont abide by that basic precept of matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
4922404 i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
4922405 i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
4922406 ok we dont have to go longer on that one
4922407 i think my faith is strong enough and my marriage is strong enough that i can afford those civil rights to others even if i have a different perspective
4922408 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4922409 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4922410 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4922411 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4922412 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4922413 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4922414 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4922415 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4922416 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4922417 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4922418 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4922419 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment
4922420 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4922421 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4922422 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect
4922423 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science

4922425 deliver superior investment performance by taking a long term investment view and integrating sustainability research within a rigorous fundamental equity analysis framework
4922426 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4922427 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4922428 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4922429 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4922430 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4922431 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4922432 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4922433 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4922434 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4922435 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4922436 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4922437 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4922438 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4922439 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4922440 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4922441 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf
4922442 we are being told by scientists around the world particularly the international group that is charged with studying this and reporting to world leaders that we may have less than 10 years in order to make dramatic changes lest we lose the chance to avoid catastrophic results from the climate crisis
4922443 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4922444 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4922445 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4922446 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4922447 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4922448 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4922449 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4922450 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4922451 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4922452 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4922453 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4922454 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4922455 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4922456 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4922457 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4922458 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4922459 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4922460 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4922461 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4922462 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4922463 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4922464 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4922465 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4922466 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4922467 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4922468 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4922469 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4922470 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4922471 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4922472 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4922473 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4922474 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4922475 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4922476 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration
4922477 i want to convey my respect for the idea even as i explain to you why i dont think thats the best idea
4922478 to focus on and try and enlarge the political space in which we address this climate crisis
4922479 to bring about a sea change in public opinion across party lines
4922480 remember america i gave you the internet and i can take it away
4922481 i found it interesting that over the weekend i heard a sound bite on the news from al gore where he was also using the figure of the equivalent of a dollar a gallon
4922482 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4922483 we are honored to welcome u s vice president gore one of the worlds most respected leaders to west coast green
4922484 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4922485 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world
4922486 this is all a dream come true being able to imagine anything and work towards it
4922487 having ups having downs and being able to accomplish everything you ever dreamed of its fun feels pretty good
4922488 as to if someone like mike will come around again the term spitzian is out now
4922489 its phelpsian i coined that were all very proud to be part of this
4922490 i wanted to take it out hard and hold on
4922491 we were trying to build off the momentum we had
4922492 we knew we had a good relay going in we wanted to do this not just for michael but for all of us
4922493 she started crying i started crying my sister started crying its been fun im glad i was able to accomplish everything i wanted to im lucky to have the talent i have the drive i have the excitement for the sport
4922494 michael phelps it cant be described the level of achievement hes done i dont think well see it again i thought he could win six or seven and with a little luck he could get eight everything lined up perfectly for him good on him for what he achieved hes a good bloke
4922495 doing all best times winning every race everything was accomplished that we wanted to its been a fun last four years and its been one fun week thats for sure
4922496 i have memories i have pictures ill have the medals forever i have all the suits all the caps and all the goggles i wore i have everything some of the best memories you have are time spent with your teammates its one of the greatest memories being part of team usa

4922500 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4922501 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4922502 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4922503 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4922504 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4922505 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4922506 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4922507 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4922508 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4922509 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4922510 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4922511 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4922512 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4922513 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4922514 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4922515 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4922516 not getting chase davidson in an astro uniform to say the least is disappointing
4922517 i can honestly say that as a scouting staff and organization we made every effort on our part to get this deal done
4922518 this happens to be part of the risk of drafting an 18 year old high school player as well as every negotiation having its unique dynamics we met both the pre draft and adjusted post draft demands of the family but came up empty in our attempt as it became obvious that there was a change of heart of where they wanted their next stop in chases baseball career to start
4922519 in the 13 years of being involved in selecting players with the intent of signing the player on draft day this is the first player i have been involved with that has not signed the only silver lining to this outcome is the compensation pick that we will receive in the 2009 draft and i am very confident we will find and sign a prospect of similar value to sign 16 of our first 17 selections is a tribute to the due diligence of our area scouts and supervisors as well as the commitment of our front office and owner we will get past this and continue to push forward in our quest to continue adding quality talent to our system
4922520 hes a tremendous player and not having him in there is definitely something not good for our lineup but going to third base is natural to me ive always loved playing third
4922521 its actually an easier position than first base and thats something a lot of people dont realize at third you dont quite have all the moving around as you do at first base first base is far more physical
4922522 that all star game could be a part of it
4922523 but the fact is i have thrown a lot of innings and if all that happens is i have to be pushed back a few days i dont see that as a major issue
4922524 as the manager of the team there were two fundamental responsibilities
4922525 one was to win the game and the second was just as important to get everyone home safely there is no easy answer we knew the game was going to be played to its completion

4922528 coming on the eve of the national political conventions where the topic of war will be front and center the art of war will explore the myriad of ways artists have attempted to deal with the subject
4922529 it is one of the great pragmatic functions of art when weighty decisions have to be made human beings turn to art to distill insight understanding and even solace out of chaos and suffering
4922530 these programming selections are certainly powerful examples of that function
4922531 tikka sears work created under compulsion is a powerful exploration

4922538 mill claimed that mathematical truths were merely very highly confirmed generalizations from experience mathematical inference generally conceived as deductive and a priori in nature mill set down as founded on induction thus in mills philosophy there was no real place for knowledge based on relations of ideas in his view logical and mathematical necessity is psychological we are merely unable to conceive any other possibilities than those which logical and mathematical propositions assert this is perhaps the most extreme version of empiricism known but it has not found many defenders

4922548 its a big day for china but we want to do more
4922549 we were playing at home and we just cannot lose this game
4922550 we win this game tonight because of our defense and the way yao played inside
4922551 its bigger than in 2004 because its really difficult having the home court and everything that comes with it
4922552 it makes me more excited it gives me more emotion
4922553 i think this team comes with more experience after all of our training games and a very frustrating game against spain
4922554 i think we all learn how to trust each other play together and win this game as a team
4922555 sometimes it seems like we are down like at halftime and in the fourth quarter but we know what to do

4922560 we talked about coming in this year and wanting to get more yards after the catch and he was able to do that saturday he was able to break a couple of tackles and get down the field
4922561 when youre put in that position right off the bat on the road you can put yourself in a hole but we kept our heads up and held them to the field goal
4922562 reeves gave it away early that he was going for my knees and when i saw what he was doing it was a spur of the moment thing
4922563 i told coach i felt good that there was no swelling and that i needed to gauge where i was
4922564 as a defensive player you never want to give up this many points
4922565 but as a fan this was a fun game to watch
4922566 im happy with the way this first game the first chance to play went
4922567 i felt good out there i felt like i played average at best but its a start and you have to start somewhere i will take a few four yard carries like i had tonight
4922568 i ran with some toughness and i put my foot down a couple of times in there

4922571 the christian does not think god will love us because we are good but that god will make us good because he loves us
4922572 right actions done for the wrong reason do not help build the internal quality or character we might think that god wanted simply obedience to a set of rules whereas he really wants people of a particular sort
4922573 we learn that we cannot trust ourselves even in our best moments and on the other that we need not despair even in our worst for our failures are forgiven the only fatal thing is to sit down content with anything less than perfection
4922574 if you want to find out how proud you are the easiest way is to ask yourself

4922629 a thriving entertainment district is critical to downtown revitalization we have many responsible night establishment operators and owners who dedicate themselves to running responsible and legal operations our organizations will not tolerate operators who dont share this vision
4922630 this is important because even if the liquor license were to go away we want this individual out of this business because he clearly has created an environment that is bad for albuquerques kids

4922698 i dont think thats actually a very good place from which to proceed on an argument that russia ought to be considered a responsible member of the international system

4922735 you know what he expects and then you just go out there and do what youve got to do
4922736 were playing a lot of 22 23 year old guys most of our football team the guys that were really hanging our hat on are the guys in their fourth year junior and fifth year senior years
4922737 im talking about them when they were at this point in their careers not now as nba players
4922738 i was working with the seniors guys going to college and derrick was able to pick up on things quicker than they did
4922739 he works very hard on his skills he works drills with his left hand and with his right hand and he works on his perimeter game
4922740 but he is a point i am sure that baylor envisions him playing alongside john wall but both are point guards
4922741 it could be this or could be that thats causing the problem
4922742 even though it was tough i think it was probably worth it for me as a coach i really do because it helped me grow as a coach
4922743 i think i learned a lot about going from teaching professionals to teaching kids that are just coming out of high school and into college just how much more detailed you have to be in coaching young men and being around them
4922744 what we want to do is not boggle the kids minds with another scheme
4922745 fundamentals are very very critical ive learned through good and bad experiences that its not about how much defense a defense has its how well they play the fundamentals in that defense
4922746 i had moved from corner to safety to outside linebacker so i was kind of moving closer to the line of scrimmage so i figured by then i wasnt going to be an nfl corner withers said
4922747 and i was always intrigued with xs and os and that kind of stuff was always doodling plays and schemes so coaching made sense

4922750 we have received numerous complaints and a lot of organizations are threatening to sue us

4922753 we knew that our charity program will raise a lot of eyebrows but what the people dont see is that were not different from the other industries we will never waver in our commitment just because people view it differently
4922754 robins plans caught everyone in guns as well as our fans a bit off guard

4922760 what hes been doing looks like a guy thats played the game of football in our system
4922761 the other guys theyre young and very talented but theyre maybe looking right when they should be looking left
4922762 it hurts pretty bad to miss the season but its just something youve got to move on with
4922763 there are so many emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4922764 without the help of my team mates this isnt possible
4922765 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4922766 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had
4922767 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4922768 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4922769 its a beautiful thing i am so proud to be a part of this relay team
4922770 the good thing our offense has done is be minimal on turnovers
4922771 we had two on tuesday but they were aggressive turnovers
4922772 we really limited the defense not knowing who was in the stands
4922773 we also limited our offense some in the passing game
4922774 i still see some things we need to work on but we are a lot further than a year ago
4922775 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4922776 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4922777 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4922778 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4922779 this is a planning took where all things are going
4922780 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4922781 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4922782 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4922783 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4922784 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4922785 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4922786 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4922787 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4922788 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4922789 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4922790 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4922791 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4922792 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4922793 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4922794 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4922795 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4922796 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4922797 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4922798 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4922799 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4922800 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4922801 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4922802 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4922803 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4922804 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4922805 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4922806 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4922807 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4922808 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4922809 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4922810 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4922811 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4922812 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4922813 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4922814 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4922815 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4922816 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4922817 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4922818 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4922819 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4922820 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4922821 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4922822 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4922823 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4922824 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4922825 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4922826 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4922827 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4922828 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4922829 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4922830 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4922831 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4922832 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4922833 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4922834 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4922835 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4922836 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

4922841 love and life according to the gospel are beyond mans abilities they are possible only as a result of a gift of god who heals restores and transforms the human heart by his grace
4922842 a possibility opened to man exclusively by grace by the gift of god by his love
4922843 the entire christian life bears the mark of the spousal love of christ and the church
4922844 vital and personal relationship with the living and true god is prayer
4922845 let our masks fall and turn our hearts back to the lord who loves us so as to hand ourselves over to him as an offering to be purified and transformed
4922846 i was afraid because i was naked so i hid myself
4922847 the great mystical tradition of the church shows how prayer can progress as a genuine dialogue of love to the point of rendering the person wholly possessed by the divine beloved vibrating at the spirits touch resting filially within the fathers heart
4922848 this is a journey totally sustained by grace which nonetheless demands an intense spiritual commitment and is no stranger to painful purifications the dark night
4922849 just as in the consummation of carnal marriage there are two in one flesh so also when the spiritual marriage between god and the soul is consummated there are two natures in one spirit and love
4922850 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4922851 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4922852 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4922853 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4922854 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4922855 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4922856 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4922857 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4922858 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4922859 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4922860 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4922861 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4922862 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4922863 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4922864 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4922865 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4922866 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4922867 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4922868 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4922869 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4922870 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4922871 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4922872 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4922873 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4922874 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4922875 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4922876 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4922877 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4922878 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4922879 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4922880 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4922881 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4922882 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4922883 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4922884 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4922885 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4922886 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4922887 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4922888 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4922889 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4922890 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4922891 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4922892 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4922893 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4922894 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4922895 weighing all the pros and cons it seems to me that the story of the syrophonecian woman is so shot through with christian missionary theology and concerns that creation by first generation christians is the more likely conclusion
4922896 the law was given that grace might be sought and grace was given that the law might be fulfilled
4922897 to express the relationship between man and woman between what is feminine and what is masculine
4922898 were we to disregard the eucharist how could we overcome our own deficiency
4922899 for the first time in my life i understood the meaning of christs words this is my body given for you

4922907 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others

4922911 and suddenly it was as though a heavy heavenly veil was drawn back in the spirit realm and i heard lucifers spine chilling cry it is time and the hordes of hell resounded with a great and terrible cry it is time and as lucifer turned to his fallen princes i could hear his malicious hiss it is time to target the champions the father knows that these very ones who were drawn to him because they knew the very weakness of their own souls like the woman whose story i promised would be told eternally i spoke the woman who washed your feet jesus smiled tenderly those who have forgiven much love much in this last generation many came to us from the greatest ensnarements and bondages once they saw our great love for them they became our greatest champions and bondservants for their gratitude for receiving such a redemption was unfathomable these are the ones who have become close and tender with me who would follow me unto death but if they would follow you unto death lord jesus and they hear your voice then how could they fall to seducing spirits i asked that chill gripped me again sensing the answer every weakness that these ones experienced in their lives his expression was so grave every fissure each wound each broken place that lies unhealed these satanic powers and principalities and demons shall now target many many of my children did not receive healing of their minds emotions and souls in this last generation and because they have lived in the household of god for years many do not even realize that these scarred places exist these last days assignments have been meticulously strategised and that is the very strength of their evil they have been tailor made to each of my champions they know the urgent driving unmet needs of the soul the generational bondages of each individual called by me to impact this generation the lack of nurturing the deep unhealed rejections and hurts of the emotions the fatherlessness the need for affirmation the desire to belong the deep isolations all of which when not met in me now have laid the perfect snare for the assignments of the enemy my champions shall now know a violent satanic assailing against their minds any thought not taken captive shall be a thought that can take violent root in their soul to lead to ensnarement anything from their past that has been dealt with by their own strength and not by my spirit shall become a snare to them and can leave them vulnerable to the enemy of their souls any habit not ruthlessly dealt with and put to the cross when assigned with the searing heat of temptation will breed and rapidly multiply the greatest weapon to survive the onslaught is for my children to take up their cross and to follow me to take up the cross daily and to die to everything in their souls and their mind which opposes my truth to let go of that lower life which is the flesh and continually mortify their minds and bodies and to put to death the deeds of the flesh my children have forgotten the power of the cross they have thought that to die once is sufficient but the spirit of the world with its carnality and selfishness loosed upon this present generation is so strong in these evil days that it is only in a continual daily crucifying of their flesh that they will indeed be able to withstand temptation

4922953 rachel is a shining example of what it means to be a perfect ra she is completely selfless and kind
4922954 the belief that there is a substantially real self and the cherishing of ones own interest at the expense of others are the two main thoughts and emotions we have nurtured within us through our many lives but what is the result of this we are continually suffering and experiencing negative thoughts and emotions so our self cherishing hasnt really got us very far also if we shift our focus from ourselves to others and to the wider world and if we turn our attention to all the crises in the world all the difficulties and the sufferings and so on we will see that many of these problems are direct or indirect consequences of undisciplined negative states of mind

4922957 ves la carrera miras el marcador y hay momentos en los que me he sentido desbordado porque la situaci n se ha complicado mucho parece que hab a mucha gente que me la ten a guardada pero he podido reaccionar bien y he ganado
4922958 no marcaba a nadie marcaba a los que me marcaban a m hab a un grupo de favoritos pero al final creo que les ha ido bien a los que han hecho la carrera por su cuenta y se han arriesgado no los que han ido a rueda
4922959 bueno la verdad es que en el ltimo sprint que he puntuado sab a que llevaba m s de cinco puntos sobre el segundo y ya s lo una desgracia me pod a quitar la medalla de oro
4922960 no ha habido muchos deportistas que tienen un palmar s impresionante en los juegos
4922961 me ha dicho que ha disfrutado mucho con la carrera
4922962 pens que era por gonz lez no pasa nada es la verdad
4922963 habr que aguantar sus embestidas y hacerle jugar un partido duro que son los que le van a rafa
4922964 gonz lez es muy peligroso puede causar muchos problemas saca muy bien la derecha es de las mejores del circuito y el rev s si no va en carrera lo pega muy bien tira cortado y fuerte por algo est en la final

4922969 son adem s dos muy buenas doblistas anabel es muy creativa y vivi tiene mucha experiencia y las jugadas bien cogidas porque ha ganado nueve torneos grandes anabel inventa y vivi estructura uno de sus xitos es que llevan un a o y medio trabajando juntas lo han cogido con tiempo y eso lo ha decantado todo
4922970 este era el partido m s dif cil porque ser cuartas habr a sido muy duro
4922971 tienen una ilusi n b rbara si tienen que elegir entre una medalla y ganar el abierto de estados unidos eligen la medalla cuando se metieron en semifinales hicieron muchas risas y les tuve que decir oye me parece perfecto pero los juegos ol mpicos tienen una canallada si quedas cuarto no tienes nada
4922972 fue cuesti n de confianza y af n de no rendirse nunca tienen fe y ganas de medalla
4922973 hac a cuatro a os que no se me cerraba el est mago se nota que hay ilusi n los nervios est n a flor de piel
4922974 es el nico torneo en el que doy m s importancia al doble que al individual

4922976 puede pasar de todo entre el segundo y el sexto van nueve puntos
4922977 los daneses lo tienen chupado haci ndolo medio bien son oro pero las regatas son las regatas

4922984 el mejor el m s explosivo el m s joven
4922985 nos han arrasado hay que aceptar la realidad no estoy contento sobre todo por la poca intensidad y concentraci n del equipo al inicio del partido la diferencia entre los balones perdidos 28 y los recuperados 6 indica que ellos han tenido 22 posesiones m s para jugar a lo que hay que a adir que han obtenido unos porcentajes en los triples 48 muy superiores a los partidos anteriores 33 tenemos que jugar con m s agresividad porque si no da igual el tipo de defensa que hagamos individual presionante o en zona
4922986 es una lecci n para saber qu tenemos que hacer para poder competir con este equipo de estados unidos definitivamente hemos jugado mal y ellos han sido m s fuertes no hemos podido responder no hemos mostrado nuestro nivel pero esperamos tener otra oportunidad
4922987 pinta que jugaremos contra los croatas se aseguran el tercer puesto de su grupo si ganan ma ana a ir n sin duda nuestro partido ante angola ser una buena preparaci n para los cuartos de final tenemos que llegar lo m s frescos que sea posible y para ello tenemos que hacer un partido que nos deje unas sensaciones mejores que los que hemos jugado hasta ahora

4923001 teniendo en cuenta que en la final el viento fue nulo si metemos dos metros por segundo de viento a favor el m ximo legal y nos vamos a una altura de 600 700 metros estoy seguro de que bajar de los 9 60s una marca que hace nada parec a ut pica
4923002 robinho se queda seguro y no tengo por qu volverme loco con el tema de qui n le puede sustituir no me voy a preocupar por eso porque l es un jugador del madrid y en ning n momento vi que cambiara de actitud con nosotros
4923003 yo no me quiero meter en esos asuntos el tema representantes no es un problema m o
4923004 esto no es el hamburgo all era el amo todas las jugadas de ataque ten an que pasar por sus pies daba pases de gol e incluso los marcaba aqu las responsabilidades se reparten y no tiene por qu ser el nico que cargue con todo
4923005 me ha sorprendido la presi n del equipo y que jueguen con la defensa muy adelantada

4923007 im just going up there with confidence im getting good swings on the ball as far as them all being extra base hits thats really surprising

4923009 i want him to see what he can see as an outside observer we have a lot of youngsters here i think he can help instill some pride
4923010 from el greco to vel zquez art during the reign of philip iii
4923011 first of all the pictures are in and of themselves very important examples of the artists represented
4923012 but whens the last time theres been a significant concentration of paintings by el greco and vel zquez in north carolina i can tell you never
4923013 is anybody here claustrophobic or afraid of tight dark places
4923014 so is everybody up for a little crawling because were going to crawl through here
4923015 they bat aggressive and i really like it bolt said
4923016 we have obtained the best possible help to assist us in the case as asif is adamant he is innocent
4923017 we are having the b sample test for the reconfirmation and we have to be present there inshallah i will be cleared
4923018 if i am cleared which i am confident i will be i will try to make a place for myself in the pakistan team as soon as possible
4923019 we have asked him to pay the fine or it would not be possible for us to retain him in champions trophy squad
4923020 there is no court order saying he should not pay the fine even if the court upholds his petition against the ban and fine it will be refunded to him but he has to pay the fine now
4923021 some teams have also raised questions about the timing of the competition in pakistan when muslims the world over fast in the holy month of ramazan
4923022 the truth is that even within the pcb there is a sinking feeling of a losing battle and they are expecting the worst in the next few days
4923023 if the icc manages to convince the teams that champions trophy should be held in pakistan then it would be a major achievement but at the moment most of the teams are in the comfortable position of defending themselves by pointing out that the travel advisories to them by their foreign office does not encourage travelling to pakistan
4923024 i dont understand this given the critical situation when the icc task force was in pakistan the chairman was not in the country then why send coach geoff lawson to australia and new zealand when already in the past even the australians were not convinced by his arguments about playing in pakistan
4923025 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4923026 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4923027 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4923028 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4923029 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference

4923043 a commission is a good way to celebrate such events
4923044 the problem with writing an orchestral piece based on music from this period is that most of it is vocal either secular songs accompanied by guitar or sacred music done in the cathedral
4923045 i want the listener to enter into a relationship with this music it refers to a very specific time but its a piece of music not a lecture
4923046 before i read the book i thought being quixotic was a good thing something an artist needed to do sometimes to dream an impossible dream
4923047 but now i think cervantes point is that sometimes having a very strong ideal in the hands of a fool is dangerous the book shows cervantes great understanding of humanity

4923060 el trabajo de phelps servir de inspiraci n para los j venes de todo el mundo
4923061 siempre me pregunt qu iba a decir en el momento en que pasara lo que ha pasado y por supuesto ya sab a desde hace tiempo lo que le dir a a michael phelps
4923062 es un riesgo pero hermoso es bonito ver que todav a hay en el balonmano mentes creativas gente que inventa soluciones para problemas antiguos pero pastor no es nico nosotros tambi n aportamos novedades al juego
4923063 nosotros hemos hecho la brecha en ese momento pero ah no hemos ganado el partido lo hemos ganado gracias a que nuestra defensa ha ido ahogando a espa a progresivamente
4923064 y los goles que nos han metido casi todos al contraataque uno a porter a vac a otro con malmagro intentando tapar huecos tambi n habr an ca do con portero fijo el problema no ha sido se no nos podemos quedar en lo puntual el problema es que hemos sido un desastre en el ataque

4923069 everyone agrees that we need to expand the pipe which means that we can get more people across quicker more efficiently
4923070 and there is a lack of money right now maybe people pay a certain amount to come cross lets assume 5 dont hold me to that but that would then pay the bonds so we can develop infrastructure
4923071 i mean its very important to stewart haas racing obviously
4923072 the flood of personnel that have come over and wanted to join the team since we made that announcement has been huge with the addition of ryan coming on board now i think its even going to make that list even grow larger
4923073 you know to have tony come on board obviously and now ryan its just unbelievable tonys led the charge the programs growing its exciting to be part of it
4923074 i think a lot of tony from a personal standpoint as well as a driving standpoint and ive seen his success from an ownership standpoint with the usac cars and the world of outlaws cars ive seen him get the job done in other venues and i look forward to the opportunity
4923075 hopefully in the next couple weeks well have something locked down on that side
4923076 i told tony the bottom line is im here to have fun i want to have fun with you i know he wants to have fun doing this
4923077 thats what racing hasnt been a whole lot of for me lately due to the fact we had success in 02 03 part of 04 and since then it hasnt been as successful therefore some of the fun is gone with that i look forward to having fun again
4923078 i had a lot of discussions with a lot of other organizations the last little bit
4923079 i mean i couldnt tell you a day that i decided and all that stuff
4923080 the thing that impressed me the most about ryan was that he asked all the right questions
4923081 weve still never spoke about a dollar in the contract the questions he asked me about were how are we going to win races how are we going to win championships how are we going to get the right people in place to do the right jobs
4923082 it was first and foremost about how he was going to run and how we were going to ensure that we were going to get him quality cars equipment people to surround him to give him that opportunity
4923083 the competition side will probably be rougher with us going fishing than anything
4923084 the first time he gets me in a boat and gets me out about 50 feet and says all right were fishing for paychecks today im swimming back if i drown you guys will know what happened
4923085 if you dream your biggest dream anything is possible no matter what you set your imagination to anything can happen
4923086 i got touched out and i threw my goggles i didnt like to lose and i showed that i had to grow out of it throwing my cap or throwing a temper tantrum on the pool deck
4923087 i think he was 10 when i first saw him
4923088 and it was apparent that he was going to do whatever it took to win
4923089 i knew it was going to be a very very tough race to win but i didnt care
4923090 i wanted to race in it and thats what i did i felt successful being able to do a best time and being only a few tenths outside a gold medal
4923091 he has shown a different kind of courage than i did
4923092 when i think about michael not only swimming events that he holds the world record in but also challenging himself in events that he is second fastest or third fastest in the world and putting them into his program that is more than i did
4923093 phelps could break his arm before beijing but as long as they have some duct tape they can just tape him back up and hell swim and win
4923094 he does such a good job of measuring his effort
4923095 when you see how many events he has to swim and how he swims well in the prelims but not outstanding he swims a little bit better in the semis usually always good enough to get one of the centre lanes and then its showtime
4923096 im not doing it for the money i love what i do
4923097 on my crappiest days when im tired and jet lagged i jump in that water and just something happens that i cant even put into words
4923098 without question this is one of the more important exhibitions weve had here
4923099 i wont say there wont be another opportunity to see these works again
4923100 we just believe releasing it on a wednesday before a four day weekend is like having a rolling sneak preview
4923101 you get a lot of positive word of mouth going into the weekend you have two days of people validating the movie locally
4923102 its a sign that people are not only picking movies as the weekend choice for entertainment but also in the middle of the week as well
4923103 i felt like consumers were more confused than ever before
4923104 i felt like people really needed help in this under 15 range of how to make sense of it all
4923105 there are things you have to learn about your own taste

4923301 why is cbc paying attention to michael phelps well hes possibly the greatest amateur athlete of all time and the biggest story of the olympics
4923302 phelps is amazing this guy is dominating his sport like no other like wayne gretzky and michael jordan in their day
4923303 michael phelps is the worlds best swimmer right now and he is on the verge of fulfilling a great achievement
4923304 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4923305 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4923306 amazing as it is the democrats have allowed the republicans to put them on the defensive and swing public opinion in their favor despite having the bush administrations bottomless pit of scandal incompetence high crimes and misdemeanors lift the ban then let oil companies deal with the states and so many environmental ngos in the courts while repealing taxpayer subsidies which should be done anyway and enacting environmental regulations in the next administration its called picking your battles for whatever reason the democrats consistently pick the wrong ones
4923307 congress should lift the federal ban and replace it with strict environmental oversight in the form of expensive bonds while removing oil subsidies and tax breaks then as conservatives always champion leave it up to the states to decide
4923308 the solution for many conservatives is to drill for more oil with prices at historic highs that goes without saying market forces will certainly respond accordingly in addition president bush lifted the executive ban on offshore drilling this may very well be justified provided taxpayers dont subsidize it and oil companies are forced to purchase bonds in excess of any possible cleanup costs associated with a spill more on this later so long as it makes economic sense under these conditions its worth exploring

4923572 in order that we might be justified forensically with ethical implications on the basis of faithfulness of christ and not on the basis of the works of the law

4923593 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4923594 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4923595 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour

4923619 when we were over there we asked the british why they loved linkedin so much i got some great answers friends reunited was a pretty big thing for a while and it sounds like it played a role in training people locally
4923620 many people in the british focus groups thought linkedin was a uk company
4923621 it is designed as a very professional reserved low key site as opposed to something that is full of advertisements the loud view that many people have of america because its more formal and they are reading british english they ended up valuing it as a local product
4923622 we think we are earning each member one at a time
4923623 the average age of our users is 41 and they have an income of over 100 000 51 000 if we wanted linkedin to take off tomorrow and just valued ourselves for the number of users we would put photo sharing on the site something proven to drive activity levels we havent
4923624 linkedin gives them the ability to tap in to their employees social capital
4923625 the companies that buy from us are the kind of companies you want to work for they see the value of using it as a recruiting tool and a collaboration tool these are companies that dont feel threatened

4923635 its so hard not to have martine in the finals right now
4923636 i couldnt believe it here i was on the verge of middle age with two little kids and it was a chore just to push them around the block in a stroller
4923637 its nice i can take the momentum going into sunday
4923638 it would have been horrible to finish with a bogey
4923639 i got the wind wrong i thought it was down out of the right and when i hit it it was down out of the left
4923640 i was thinking to myself try to get it about 10 feet from the hole
4923641 it was a bonus the way it came off i got lucky that i got relief from the grandstand i got a good lie on the drop
4923642 i made a nice putt for birdie on the third hole after a shakey start
4923643 it settled me down a little bit i had a really good up and down on the 5th hole and kind of got going from there
4923644 it played different today with the wind its tricky its a tough golf course when the wind is blowing as streamlined as it is the wind gets in there and swirls a little bit
4923645 i just got distracted on one shot i had a butterfly fly between me and the ball on the down swing i kind of flinched and pulled it left out of bounds i ended up making triple on the eighth hole
4923646 pretty much everything was going right for me shooting a 63
4923647 to shoot a round like that out there on that golf course youve got to have all facets of your game playing well ive driven it really well the last three days if ou can get into the fairway and get some short irons in your hands it definitely helps and youve always got to make a few putts
4923648 put some pressure on the leader sunday i just want to get a good start nice and solid nothing too spectcular just hit like ive been hitting today and see what happens
4923649 i havent played as many events as some of these guys its hard work on this tour you know that every shot makes a big difference for the rest of your life its going to be a big day it will be nice if i can top it off but well see
4923650 i dont think i missed too many fairways which is always a good thing around this kind of golf course i held some putts i had a good stretch going from 9 to 14 where i made some good birdies
4923651 i got myself back into the tournament which is exactly what i wanted to do
4923652 with the quickness a little tale of young black love hardcore style

4923673 the number of single mothers who are unemployed and who receive no welfare assistance has doubled from 16 percent in 1996 to nearly 33 percent in 2005 or one in three single parents
4923674 and only those families with a working wife have seen real improvement in their living standards
4923675 any type of increase in cost especially of this magnitude is just going to make life so precarious so difficult perhaps even unlivable unless we can subsidize those households so that they can make it
4923676 i cant even think about the next two winters its obviously a horror show in the making

4923678 the economy is so bad that summer jobs once designed for youth are now being taken up by unemployed adults who need them

4923695 o lord god of israel there is no god like you in heaven or on earth you keep your covenant of love with your servants who continue wholeheartedly in your way
4923696 the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us we have seen his glory the glory of the one and only who came from the father full of grace and truth
4923697 the heavens even the highest heavens cannot contain you how much less this temple i have built
4923698 how much less this body i have walking around in my living room unable to get in the shower until about 4 pm
4923699 may your eyes be open toward this temple day and night this place of which you said you would put your name there
4923700 since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken let us be thankful and so worship god acceptably with reverence and awe for our god is a consuming fire
4923701 when all the israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the lord above the temple they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground and they worshiped and gave thanks to the lord saying he is good his love endures forever
4923702 i will cause all my goodness to pass in front of you and i will proclaim my name the lord in your presence i will have mercy on whom i will have mercy and i will have compassion on whom i will have compassion
4923703 the lord the lord the compassionate and gracious god slow to anger abounding in love and faithfulness maintaining love to thousands and forgiving wickedness rebellion and sin
4923704 then the temple of the lord was filled with a cloud and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud for the glory of the
4923705 surely you desire truth in the inner parts you teach me wisdom in the inmost place
4923706 i started the tournament with 8 to 12 rods on the deck and im now down to just three
4923707 i know what to look for but i have run completely out of water
4923708 ive been very comfortable fishing new water as long as it has the right ingredients
4923709 but today i fished everything on this lake that looked like that and ive basically got no new water to fish im going to have to start repeating on water that ive fished over the last few days and im a little nervous about that because i feel like the fish dont replenish very fast in these areas
4923710 getting at least three fish in the boat in the first three hours is crucial
4923711 that puts me on the right pace to finish my limit by check in
4923712 i get nervous on stage but once thats over im fine
4923713 im very familiar with whats going on in there each day the pattern changes just a bit some days the fish are more tucked in the cover and i have to probe in there to get them out other days the fish are more outside the cover and i have to swim the bait more on the outsides of the cover to get the bites
4923714 we might be overlapping a tad but for the most part we are all fishing different types of stuff up there
4923715 i wish that lead was just a few ounces instead of a few pounds
4923716 but the pressure is on bennett to hold the lead now
4923717 i only caught one on top today and i ended up culling that one
4923718 i spent too much time fishing that toad today and when i finally put it down i caught some flipping and on a shaky head im telling you every day is like a completely different day out here
4923719 some of them are on grass but some of them are coming off nothing looking areas too
4923720 some of the best banks are just little flat banks with nothing on them
4923721 i struggled for a while and then made a move down to some clearer water and that seemed to help my bite
4923722 im focusing on the back ends of creeks especially where i find mix of docks and grass but i cant get bites in areas ive already fished over so covering new water is a key component to how im fishing
4923723 this suggest to us that as the sacrifice was constantly upon the altar so also the atoning death of christ is always available to us for forgiveness of sins so the death of christ is adequate to meet every special need of our souls
4923724 let us draw near to god with a sincere heart in full assurance of faith having our hearts sprinkled to cleanse us from a guilty conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water
4923725 the furniture of the court was connected with sacrifice that of the sanctuary itself with the deeper mysteries of mediation and access to god
4923726 now i am going to him who sent me it is for
4923727 will not the ministry of the spirit be even more glorious if the ministry that condemns men the law is glorious how much more glorious is the ministry that brings righteousness
4923728 a casual stroll through the lunatic asylum shows that faith does not prove anything
4923729 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4923730 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4923731 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4923732 he was choking the s t out of me and i wasnt fixing to die that night
4923733 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4923734 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4923735 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4923736 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer
4923737 whenever he told me to watch my mouth i looked at him like he was crazy like he didnt look like an actual police officer to me
4923738 decker was calling me a chicken s mother f get out and i will beat your ass
4923739 what agreement is there between the temple of god and idols for we are the temple of the living god as god has said i will live with them and walk among them and i will be their god and they will be my people therefore come out from them and be separate says the lord touch no unclean thing and i will receive you i will be a father to you and you will be my sons and daughters says the lord almighty since we have these promises dear friends let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit perfecting holiness out of reverence for god
4923740 let us purify ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit
4923741 were unfaithful they did evil in the eyes of the lord and forsook him they shut the doors and put out the lamps they didnt burn incense or present any burnt offerings at the sanctuary to the lord
4923742 consecrate yourselves now and consecrate the temple of the lord remove all defilement from the sanctuary my sons do not be negligent now for the lord has chosen you to stand before him and serve him to minister before him and to burn incense
4923743 therefore i urge you sisters in view of gods mercy to offer your bodies as living sacrifices holy and pleasing to god this is your spiritual act of worship
4923744 here i am living in a palace of cedar while the ark of god remains in a tent
4923745 whatever you have in mind go ahead and do it for the lord is with you
4923746 that night the word of the lord came to nathan saying
4923747 say to the israelites the lord the god of your fathers has sent me to you this is my name forever the name by which i am to be remembered from generation to generation
4923748 i was the lord god who brought them out from under the yoke of their oppressors
4923749 the egyptians will know that i am the lord when i stretch out my hand against egypt and bring the israelites out of it
4923750 an angel of the lord appeared to them and the glory of the lord shone around them and they were terrified
4923751 do not be afraid i bring you good news of great joy that will be for all the people today in the town of david a savior has been born to you he is christ the lord
4923752 the word became flesh and made his dwelling among us we have seen his glory the glory of the one and only who came from the father full of grace and truth
4923753 fill the jars with water now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet
4923754 this the first of his miraculous signs jesus performed at cana in galilee
4923755 he thus revealed his glory and his disciples put their faith in him
4923756 josiah was eight years old when he became king and he reigned in jerusalem thirty one years
4923757 he did what was right in the eyes of the lord and walked in all the ways of his father david not turning aside to the right or to the left
4923758 and walked in all the ways of his great great great great great grandfather david
4923759 hilkiah the high priest said to shaphan the secretary i have found the book of the law in the temple of the lord he gave it to shaphan who read it
4923760 whats this ooohhhh i heard about this hey shaphan i found the book of the law you might want to take a look
4923761 because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before the lord when you heard what i have spoken against this place and its people i have heard you
4923762 to follow the lord and keep his commands regulations and decrees with all his heart and all his should and all the people pledged themselves to the covenant
4923763 the spirit searches all things even the deep things of god we have not received the spirit of the world but the spirit who is from god that we may understand what god has freely given us this is what we speak not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught us by the spirit expressing spiritual truths in spiritual words
4923764 and this is my prayer that your love may abound more and more in
4923765 but in my view your face is not everything real beauty lies inside a person not outside
4923766 because beauty is all about faces and beautiful girls and skin
4923767 help us bring back a smile to the face of these survivors
4923768 they say that when we come to a beauty salon we come with the expectation that were going to be relaxed in a different frame of mind
4923769 if we come here and we see someone who has gone through so much pain and misery so automatically that gives us that low feeling also they have a point
4923770 at the same time there are clients who take pride in asking these girls to give them a blow dry or getting a manicure or pedicure taken from them
4923771 once we had a wedding in the family i went there and all the girls were getting dressed and putting on makeup so that time i felt a pain in my heart
4923772 but i dont want to weaken myself with these thoughts
4923773 the peace of mind i have now i never had before i suffered much more mental anguish in my married life
4923774 i feel that her hands call me again and again
4923775 when i see them i want to be like them strong girls
4923776 i want to make a name for myself in this profession
4923777 im independent now i stand on my own two feet
4923778 i have a job i work i earn in fact im living on my own which isnt an easy thing to do for a woman in pakistan for a lone woman to survive
4923779 you say that it is your custom to burn widows very well we also have a custom when men burn a woman alive we tie a rope around their necks and we hang them build your funeral pyre beside it my carpenters will build a gallows you may follow your custom and then we will follow ours

4923783 these growing tapestries provide insulation help filter rainwater that flows across its surface create a cooling effect and lend an often surprising visual interest in places one wouldnt expect to see plants
4923784 there are so many places that need a vertical garden parking lots train stations the metro all those difficult spots those places where you really dont expect to encounter the living that is what interests me above all else
4923785 we want to be on the site with an as of right zoning bylaw in november
4923786 wed like to start construction next spring and be open for business in september of 2010
4923787 working backward from that date through the construction process leaves us no room for approval delays we want to take out that risk of delay
4923788 and what does the lord require of you to act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god
4923789 does evil exist and if so do we ignore it do we negotiate with it do we contain it or do we defeat it
4923790 i had no idea there was an organization like this and i sure as heck didnt know it was based right here in mt lebanon
4923791 anyone who has the opportunity to do this should seize it
4923792 they started this scheme on their own as they thought that they would have better bargaining power to get better prices from wholesalers
4923793 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
4923794 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
4923795 love the lord your god with all your heart and with all your soul and
4923796 just because i can do it should i do it
4923797 i think we dream so we dont have to be apart so long
4923798 its a wonder i havent abandoned all my ideals they seem so absurd and impractical
4923799 paying their fair share may very well fall on incredulous if not deaf ears

4923802 each cockroach produces 600 babies in their lifetime and we have more than 100 entrants so our success to date is that we are reducing 60 000 cockroaches without using any chemicals at all and thats the beauty of it
4923803 the termite queen is like an egg laying machine so with every queen we get rid of 100 000 termites immediately
4923804 we went out with the soldiers and a lot of them helped us because we know them
4923805 i didnt think we had a winner because a lot of people brought big ones and there were many almost as big as this one
4923806 the prize money is fine but we spent quite a lot of money to get it
4923807 every termite will emit co2 from their gut because when they consume the wood and digest it they get wind
4923808 with every degree the global temperature rises the life cycle of each bug will be shorter the quicker the life cycle the higher the population of pests
4923809 we know very well well not be about to win the war against insects they have been here much longer than us cockroaches were here 350 million years ago
4923810 we used to live plain and simple a wall was a simple brick wall but now we have decorated walls that insects hide behind
4923811 faltam pequenos detalhes para alcan armos os pa ses europeus um deles n o ter medo de ganhar e isso s se consegue com maturidade
4923812 n o quero que todos pensem exclusivamente neste jogo contra a su cia quero que pensem sobre o que era o handebol brasileiro antes e o que representa hoje
4923813 scratch your own itch like twitter evan williams and jack dorsey created it in two weeks as a way to scratch their own itch its amazing how many otherwise smart well funded companies will use awful statistically invalid focus groups then say well no one in this room likes the idea but our focus groups tell us that we should make it so of course the product comes out and it fails
4923814 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4923815 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4923816 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4923817 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4923818 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4923819 be fruitful and increase in number and fill the earth
4923820 but you must not eat meat that has its lifeblood still in it
4923821 how could someone sip their martini while sitting under burning human beings
4923822 let the little children come to me and do not hinder them for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these
4923823 overpopulation is the cause of drive by shooting and other social ills but the root of the problem is christianity which posits that people are more important than sea otters and elephants
4923824 if you havent given voluntary human extinction much thought before the idea of a world with no people in it might seem strange but if you give it a chance i think you might agree that the extinction of homo sapiens would mean survival for millions if not billions of earth dwelling species
4923825 no newborn infant should be declared human until it has passed certain tests regarding its genetic endowment and that if it fails these tests it forfeits the right to live
4923826 god said do not kill in the ten commandments and then he told his people to go into a foreign land and kill every man woman and child
4923827 one of the primary reasons for allowing abortion in the state of pennsylvania is for the economic interest of the mother
4923828 keeps excessive rain off the plants blocks the wind raises daytime temperatures 5 10 degrees and often much more and keeps frosts and heavy dew off the leaves this can extend your warm season gardening a month or more at both ends and makes it possible for year round gardeners to grow a wider variety of plants through the winter
4923829 kenapa orang seperti pak harto yang dianggap jahat masih mendapat perhatian begitu besar dari negara dan semua pihak
4923830 lebih baik saya ditembak saja dari pada diperlakukan seperti ini
4923831 the storm gourmet a guide to creating extraordinary meals without electricity
4923832 but if we had not stepped in i believe they would be totally broke right now
4923833 and some of them are just really insistent on responding to these scams
4923834 and prompted an enthusiastic response from the audience it eventually became a regular series and feature on the networks web site
4923835 for the past two years leroy shared his life with cancer on the air and online with passion wit and a kind brutal honesty that created a safe space for an open and candid dialogue about the disease
4923836 cancer was not in leroys plans but he turned his battle with cancer into the most dramatic the most moving and the most important story of his life
4923837 now if somebody wants to sue us they have an option to sue but im fairly certain that a judge will see it the way the citizens see it here
4923838 the citizens deserve peace that some infringement on constitutional rights is ok and we have not violated anything as far as the constitution
4923839 weve had people call us expressing concern for their children
4923840 they had to sleep on the floor because of stray bullets
4923841 the residents of these high crime areas are already victims
4923842 theyre victims of what are happening in the neighborhoods theyre victims of fear but for them to be subject to unlawful stops and questioning that is not going to ultimately help this situation
4923843 as far as im concerned at 3 oclock in the morning nobody has any business being on the street except the law
4923844 anyone out at 3 oclock shouldnt be out on the street unless youre going to the hospital
4923845 it is pretty much unsafe to walk around at night
4923846 i wasnt going to lay down and take it the bear came and tried to fight me
4923847 i started punching it in the head kicking it and elbowing it
4923848 chugach state park is a bear factory it pumps out bears every year
4923849 they are going to be cheek to jowl with us forever
4923850 it is a state park people that use the state park they want to see bears there
4923851 you dont go swimming in shark infested waters and dont expect to be bit
4923852 we need to kill some of these bears and we need to kill some of these moose
4923853 i think the pecking order needs to be re established with humans on top
4923854 what other city in the world has pernicious wildlife running around in its city parks
4923855 why would he ever come here just to get a bunch of crowds to boo him he would be nuts to come up here
4923856 it would make the protests in europe look small i dont see any good purpose other than to check the box to say he was in all 50 states
4923857 obviously president bushs approval ratings in vermont are very low
4923858 i expect that president bush will visit here sometime before his term ends he is certainly welcome
4923859 i think he understands he is not wildly popular in vermont
4923860 with or without a picture of him with george bush its clear that governor douglas sees george bush as someone that he looks up to as his leader
4923861 i dont think it helps jim douglas at all politically to have a picture standing next to the president
4923862 he will be met with massive protests no matter where he appears in vermont he will face a massive protest
4923863 well one state always has to be the last one visited
4923864 vermont is a great state and if the president goes i hope to go with him but i dont have a schedule item to announce right now
4923865 i dont care if he is in vermont i just want him out of office and behind bars
4923866 you know i actually wish he would show up because i would like him to have an opportunity to meet people who think about their citizenship in a serious fashion
4923867 those of us who admire and are very respectful of george bush our president wish he would come and he is welcome to come at any time we understand we are a very small and not particularly significant state politically
4923868 a strong link to the city was possible because of its strategic location between ahmedabad and surat also no bombs were planted in vadodara despite it being an important centre in the state made us believe that it was either used as a safe house or base
4923869 their interrogation revealed a lot of information including the fact that the city was being used as a centre for simi operations since about six months before the blasts safdar nagori had visited the city on three to four occasions and the mastermind of the blasts mufti abdul bashar kasmi nabbed from azamgadh had also made visits to the city
4923870 it seems that the plates were made in vadodara but we are still working on the leads and would not like to disclose details at this stage
4923871 well burning man isnt about fitting it its about wearing what you want to wear being who you want to be
4923872 all we need is the story of going out to see the play
4923873 when discussing a piece of art of any kind the most boring question you can ask or answer is
4923874 theyre going to be hanging over the back of our house and now theres the medical thing
4923875 all these problems were resolved as soon as these people got away from the turbines got in the car and drove away from the house
4923876 weve had a number of other wind farms over the country and residents living by them and never had any problems
4923877 when you come home from work everything drains away from you because its so quiet and peaceful
4923878 now we are going to have to listen to those windmills whoosh whoosh whoosh
4923879 were going to have to tell people sorry but you should have come earlier the need around a place like elkton is so great that were probably going to leave feeling overwhelmed
4923880 you spend a lot of your day doing well baby checks and giving out tetanus shots because people cant or wont go see a doctor
4923881 youre wasting your time waiting until someones tooth rots out of their head or that cough becomes pneumonia so they go to the er the most expensive place where they get the least personal care
4923882 the key is going to be finding those people and actually getting them here
4923883 they say i need glasses how am i going to afford all that
4923884 the problem we have is that health care in this country is a for profit industry and theres no profit to be made in smaller communities where there are fewer patients and the ones you see tend to be older sicker and less able to pay
4923885 the best health care is comprehensive and ongoing a relationship that you think about even when youre not sick
4923886 no were not drawing a crowd but if we do what i want were never really going to be in a place to draw a crowd what matters is that we help some people
4923887 if you are going to have a relatively balanced portfolio you are going to have energy stocks
4923888 there is no way the u s government should be giving away these massive tax breaks at the expense of american families
4923889 i would like for a lot of new exploration to get prices lower
4923890 are tickled to death prices are high i am crusading for royalty checks to be smaller again
4923891 sen hutchison opposes a windfall profits tax because it was a disastrous policy that led to greater dependence on foreign sources of oil and decreased domestic production
4923892 bases every vote he casts on policy that is in the best interest of the people he represents
4923893 we interviewed 55 faculty members and deans at nine campuses across the state and many of them were unaware of the impact their decisions have on textbook prices
4923894 its another to ask students to buy books they cant afford
4923895 we would like to see bookstores disclose where these profits are going
4923896 the messages were public knowledge they were on the internet
4923897 they have made a concerted effort to harm me my family and my career
4923898 whats happened in the last 40 50 years is that human activity has made the water quality conditions worse
4923899 dead zones tend to occur in areas that are historically prime fishing grounds
4923900 there are large areas of the gulf where you cant catch any shrimp
4923901 they have major consequences for the ability of fish populations to renew themselves
4923902 but the challenge is how do you manage fertilizer use without compromising the ability of the world to feed people
4923903 instead of giving big speeches at big stadiums he needs to give straight up 10 word answers to people at wal mart about how he would improve their lives
4923904 i think sen obama is a motivational speaker but at the end of the day i dont think that will translate into votes and certainly not the image of strength that ronald reagan had
4923905 florida has not yet been locked down by either candidate or all but won by either candidate but i think obamas inability to prove his experience or prove that he owns a political issue far more than mccain is a real problem for him
4923906 the one area he still needs credibility in is experience and picking an evan bayh or a joe biden as vice president would help a lot with that
4923907 it wouldnt be bad if he came out early and said who his secretary of defense and secretary of state would be that would address and stabilize the concerns about his experience
4923908 i knew it i looked at her and i knew it
4923909 they did some then they went and got more this guy gave him way too much he went to sleep and never woke up
4923910 unfortunately because it can be snorted kids think the stigma of being a drug addict is removed
4923911 if you look at natalie and you hear the description of her you would never in a million years think that she was a child that would use heroin
4923912 youre not going to see the telltale signs like track marks and needle marks
4923913 when your daughter has had one overdose and they dont come home we both immediately started crying
4923914 there is a system out there or network and that network is going to have to be attacked
4923915 i dont think if you got bin laden tomorrow that the threat has disappeared
4923916 just as sept 11 revolutionized our resolve to defeat our enemies so has it brought into focus the opportunities we now have to secure and expand our freedom
4923917 he has the personality of a fighter pilot when somebody stings you you want to strike out
4923918 just like the american people his reaction was show me somebody to hit
4923919 demonstrated the grave threat posed by a hostile regime possessing weapons of mass destruction and with reported ties to terrorists
4923920 i trace this to a certain selfishness on my part
4923921 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4923922 for gay partners to visit each other in the hospital i dont think limits my core beliefs about what marriage is
4923923 candidates who went on the show raised about 44 percent more money than like candidates who didnt in the 30 days after the show
4923924 how can it be bad for a politician when it gives you exposure
4923925 republican rep lynn westmoreland of georgia an advocate of displaying the ten commandments in congress was asked by colbert to name all the commandments but could remember three
4923926 it was the worst experience ive had as a press secretary
4923927 part of discovery is finding things that you least expect
4923928 when you come across something like this it sends a tingle up your spine
4923929 i have never seen such an exceptional site as gobero it is actually eight sites where people not only buried their dead but actually lived as well
4923930 i think nobody is going to doubt that this is an intentional burial these people are posed
4923931 isnt it wonderful to see him every day on national television enjoying the islands
4923932 we couldnt pay for that kind of publicity and exposure
4923933 it would be the same as if in 1946 the german government said lets put up a statue to the victims of the holocaust and said lets be done with that
4923934 look 99 percent of survivors might think this is stupid and meaningless
4923935 but there might be a few people who say this is everything to me and then for them it would be worthwhile
4923936 its easy for church officials to make symbolic gestures like this in part without being cynical because its good pr
4923937 but prayers and memorials are not a substitute for real concrete change
4923938 so its important psychologically for some to get any kind of validation
4923939 so we wanted something that wouldnt make people go inside
4923940 its smooth on top but below its very rough which is like a lot of survivors
4923941 and its a man made break its trying to come together but it cant ever heal completely
4923942 i think the important part about it is that it exists
4923943 its a physical statement and its going to be really hard to pull this up and pretend it wasnt there
4923944 its a problem with this long campaign season the election starts too early
4923945 candidates were responding a year ago to concerns about health care and iraq which last summer was still pretty bad there were soft spots in the economy back then but things were pretty stable fast forward a year now the candidates have to reposition themselves
4923946 we need to cut our losses we spent a lot of money lets get our guys out
4923947 ive come to the realization that we need to keep to ourselves
4923948 they need to go back home and become legal if they want to return im paying now for them to have a lifestyle in this country that id like to have
4923949 casualties are down and the news media have fewer reporters there the situation not only stopped hemorrhaging its gotten noticeably better once iraq was off the front page voters shift their priorities
4923950 issues like russia are new so they give the media and the political observers something to talk about the economy is the one issue that continues as the dominant voter concern
4923951 users in the growing bric markets have not had the benefit of broad based content distribution thereby limiting their exposure and filling the service gap by embracing mobile transition into a personal entertainment platform
4923952 it genesis drive review genesis review genesis review be 2009
4923953 theyre in the same environment as the veterans theyre just in a different role
4923954 they dont know what to expect out on the hill until they experience it
4923955 there is nothing quite like a dose of inspiration to get the creative juices flowing again whether it be at work or in our personal lives we all need something to help rejuvenate our spirits from time to time
4923956 having attended about four geekfests i knew that i would leave the weekend inspired and ready to dive back into work and that did not change
4923957 jpg magazine is for people who love imagemaking without attitude its about the kind of photography you get when you love the moment more than the camera its for photographers who like us have found themselves online sharing their work and would like to see that work in print
4923958 unfortunately we didnt win the first game here but the atmosphere and everything is kind of what i heard about
4923959 its a lot of fun id never been here there were only about five or six parks i hadnt been to and this is one of them
4923960 hes a guy that can pinch run for us late hes a guy that can spell an infielder
4923961 he can play first he can play anywhere thats the thing that he can do hes similar to wilson betemit in the sense that he can play any infield position and has more speed than wilson well use him as we need him
4923962 thats their decision and im doing to do whatever they say
4923963 father i know that i can be a hot head envious jealous easily angered lazy
4923964 i will confess my transgressions to the lord and you forgave the guilt of my sin psalm 32 3 5
4923965 get it 100 right or dont do it at all
4923966 make modules install arch avr32 install mod path some path
4923967 i will protect him for he acknowledges my name he will call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation
4923968 much to our mutual disappointment i wont be appearing in qts forthcoming inglorious bastards due to insurmountable scheduling difficulties
4923969 we really tried to make it work but in the end it just was not possible without severe ramifications elsewhere
4923970 you realize that this is a weakness an area it doesnt define you im proud of you and what you do and the fruit you produce this is an area we are working on together
4923971 and sounds like it follows maritime and some remixes in electric feel get it
4923972 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4923973 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4923974 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4923975 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4923976 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4923977 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4923978 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4923979 the museum houses the permanent exhibition designed by pentagram partner abbott miller and developed in close coordination with the building
4923980 on the one side are all the harley davidson folks who though they had never before produced a building purely for the public helped us refine the design to reflect the company they love
4923981 why do some people reach their creative potential in business while other equally talented peers dont after three decades of painstaking research the sic stanford psychologist carol dweck believes that the answer to the puzzle lies in how people think about intelligence and talent
4923982 he wanted people who valued stretching themselves over being king of their particular hill
4923983 an inventor is simply a person who doesnt take his education too seriously you see from the time a person is six years old until he graduates from college he has to take three or four examinations a year if he flunks once he is out but an inventor is almost always failing he tries and fails maybe a thousand times it he succeeds once then hes in these two things are diametrically opposite we often say that the biggest job we have is to teach a newly hired employee how to fail intelligently we have to train him to experiment over and over and to keep on trying and failing until he learns what will work
4923984 he wanted to help get children away from a life of crime and violence
4923985 thats why hes the king of comedy he never lost his soul in chicago
4923986 was having some health issues but he always said to me every morning that he was always good
4923987 he always had time to shake a hand he was always that kid from chicago who wanted to make everybody happy and everybody laugh
4923988 thank you bernie for showing that good people do come from englewood
4923989 bernie would wear colors that crayons hadnt even thought of yet
4923990 all he talked about was his family and this city
4923991 he was a very very smart man who loved to learn new things
4923992 he was very driven but he also had a big heart
4923993 creativity is inventing experimenting growing taking risks breaking rules making mistakes and having fun
4923994 i forgot to tell you christmas is early this year
4923995 i need that man unharmed youd better give up now or this wont be pretty
4923996 i suspect that the genome soldiers are equipped with the same antifreezing peptide i gave you
4923997 hey i got me a stinger i just wanted to brag
4923998 did you know that it was the french who first thought of using electrical shocks as a means of torture
4923999 colonel im on my way to the first floor basement the shows just getting started
4924000 unlike you im proud of the destiny that is encoded in my genes
4924001 of course i am you idiotic buffoon i am beyond your pitiful intellect i can destroy your mind i will make you break down and cry like a baby
4924002 his code name is the same as yours so youll be evenly matched more or less
4924003 well we will see if there is iron in your words
4924004 meryls my daughter i didnt find out until recently i got a letter from her mother my dead brothers wife i was going to tell her after the operation was over i guess thats another secret i kept from you and her
4924005 you interrupted a very pleasant dream i was having about berries this had better be good
4924006 we can test athletes anywhere and at any time wherever they are in the world
4924007 we will follow the normal procedures the disciplinary commission will meet in the coming days
4924008 b sample halkia has already moved out of the athletes village and wont compete in the first round of the womens 400 hurdles taking place sunday
4924009 he was a great conversationalist who could hold his own with humor we hit it off right away
4924010 a lot of us have a sense of pride at being biracial because our parents worked very hard to make sure we knew our extensive family history
4924011 isnt necessarily a huge struggle but it is a constant societal nudging explain yourself
4924012 but why do i have to explain to somebody that im biracial when for everybody else its either im white or im black
4924013 i was teaching a swim lesson and my mom comes up to the side of the pool to talk to me
4924014 later one of the guys comes over and says who was that white lady thats my mommy
4924015 my white friends dont understand why black people talk about race all the time but anytime youre in a minority position youre cognizant of that
4924016 but i empathize with my moms family too its asking them to understand something they never experienced
4924017 no matter what we do we will always be interracially dating
4924018 i hope you will be haunted for the rest of your life
4924019 this storm is going to be fairly slow moving out
4924020 when i first met him i wasnt sure i thought maybe they wouldnt notice
4924021 my mother was very upset she was worried that the neighbors had seen us
4924022 growing up i never felt like i had to take sides
4924023 he was the son of a white mother and a black man
4924024 for the normal public we allocate a very strict policy for people to buy tickets each person can only buy a certain number of tickets so its very precious and they will want to see the match
4924025 for some contract clients theyre probably delaying their trips to the events the first few days they have several choices to watch and theyre being shown around beijing so later things should be better
4924026 widmungss nden der vergangenheit r chen sich das ist f r mich schon nach wenigen wochen im amt ganz klar
4924027 immer dann wenn es einen besitzerwechsel gibt wenn kinder erben oder beispielsweise in mietrechte eintreten dann r chen sich solche f lle etwa wenn ein grundst ck keine zufahrt hat oder es keine baubewilligung gibt und das was als umbau einer h tte deklariert ist dann eigentlich gar keine h tte mehr ist sondern pl tzlich ein einfamilienhaus dort steht
4924028 the biggest thing is nothing is impossible all it takes is imagination
4924029 i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done in this sport
4924030 without the help of my teammates it wouldnt have been possible we all came together as one unit
4924031 all best times winning every race every goal was accomplished its been one fun week thats for sure
4924032 mamas dont let your babies grow up to be cowboys
4924033 god demonstrates his own love for us in this while we were still sinners christ died for us
4924034 without giving enough time for the defendants to hire a defense lawyer
4924035 blessed be the lord the god of shem may canaan be the slave of shem may god extend the territory of japheth may japheth live in the tents of shem and may canaan be his slave
4924036 god said to abraham through your offspring all peoples on earth will be blessed when god raised up his servant jesus he sent him first to you to bless you by turning each of you from your wicked ways
4924037 the promises were spoken to abraham and to his seed the scripture does not say and to seeds meaning many people but and to your seed meaning one person who is christ jesus
4924038 i am who i am this is what you are to say to the israelites i am has sent me to you
4924039 i know that messiah is coming when he comes he will explain everything to us
4924040 precious blood of jesus christ a lamb without blemish or defect

4924074 not much it was not what it needs to be were not necessarily game planning out there in a scrimmage sometimes when the defense was stacked in the box wed throw the ball
4924075 if were going to do that we have to be competent enough to catch the pass and not turn it over
4924076 this is not a game that you evaluate personnel this is a game where we make sure we get plays run and make sure we get ready to go
4924077 we dont play ucla youve got to keep that in mind ucla is not on our schedule we wanted to run plays and get out of that thing
4924078 but sometimes its important in scrimmage situations to see how guys respond to that so i thought he passed the test of not going in the tank because it wasnt going well

4924088 there are still innocents suffering and paying with their lives for the sake of freedom
4924089 i heard about the explosion but the most important thing for me is to get the visit to karbala done
4924090 all i know is there is water where it didnt used to be and im responsible for dealing with that

4924142 it was an accident and my son had no right to humiliate the marabout by doing what he did

4924148 they swear allegiance to the marabout and say that whatever happens to their son is for the childs good

4924294 the people who are most respected are the ones who talk to drug companies who become consultants for multiple companies because their opinion is really valued
4924295 we prescribe the medication that works best for the patient irrespective of our relationship with a drug company
4924296 if a physician talks to all the companies and prescribes for all the companies then no company has an edge
4924297 in order to ensure that the data procured is as reliable and accurate as possible
4924298 clinical research is a critical element in the development of revolutionary medicines that help patients live longer healthier lives
4924299 you could take statistics and bar charts and make them look pretty much how you wanted them to
4924300 i saw firsthand several circumstances where my minimization of side effects or misinforming a physician had actually resulted in the patient being damaged and or killed
4924301 it makes me wonder what real safeguards there are here to protect foster children in texas from being involved in clinical trials
4924302 whether any wrong is being done or not theres certainly the perception
4924303 but i dont sit there and think hey a concerta rep came in today
4924304 there is more data out for the newer drugs which makes doctors more likely to use them thats why it appears theres something unethical going on with the drug companies when theres not

4924306 he was supposed to be in state care but nobody was looking after evan but me
4924307 now my kids dont take medications i wont ever trust doctors again
4924308 the state takes a child that is upset crying yelling and screaming because theyve just been taken from their families and with all those symptoms prescribes them medication
4924309 they think that if the child is unruly its easier to deal with them by medicating them than by counseling
4924310 its a medical model we didnt have any other options
4924311 i always questioned if they didnt need them out there in the real world why do they need them in here but i wasnt about to go against the doctors orders
4924312 were a lot more confident today that children who dont need these medications arent getting them

4924341 frankly my success and his failure are now the same things there s not going to be coexistence it s putting the united states in a choice position they ve got to choose and clearly they ve chosen musharraf over me
4924342 it s all but a like a mafia threat and this is something that the united states frankly deep down understands too they let this process unfold and ultimately folks around benazir bhutto now are saying that she was abandoned by america

4924344 the beijing olympics has witnessed the greatest olympian of all time michael phelps of the usa
4924345 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4924346 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4924347 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4924348 it cant be described well never ever see it again
4924349 hes a nice guy a good bloke and the last few years ive never seen him change
4924350 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun

4924353 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4924354 related to disclosure is the idea of how we make sure not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide
4924355 with windows 7 were trying to more carefully plan how we share information with our customers and partners this means sharing the right level of information at the right time depending on the needs of the audience
4924356 i went to israel on a skateboard trip four years ago and i met arthur rashkovan an israeli pro skater who started the group surfing 4 peace
4924357 at that time he brought 10 surfboards into gaza and has now decided to up the ante and bring in 22 more as a peace offering between the two surfing communities
4924358 we werent humanitarian workers or journalists we were just young guys with a camera
4924359 but we were very lucky and we ended up meeting with a retired general in the israel army who got us military visas
4924360 edward chase the director of photography and i got a ride down to the border from rashkovan
4924361 as we approached the border rashkovan said i want you to take down these numbers before you go
4924362 the main problem was that the israel navy was concerned that the surfboards constitute as a security threat
4924363 but we were saying that you want these young males participating in recreation as opposed to picking up rifles
4924364 this police officer approached us and then did this whistle thing and all the hamas officers with machine guns started crowding around and pointing to our cameras
4924365 i think he understood english and was just seeing what we would say
4924366 admittedly our purpose of making a documentary about surfers did sound ridiculous and after five minutes he realized that we were far too dumb to be any intelligence agents
4924367 the officer got a huge smile on his face and said welcome to gaza have you had a nice day
4924368 youre going to have to see the film its interesting how things played out
4924369 i guess its a good thing that thats the only thing missing

4924378 is undergoing a major political transformation from a centralized authoritarian musharraf dominated political order to democratically elected people oriented governance
4924379 he can still exercise damage control by stepping down before the joint session of the parliament takes up the impeachment resolution
4924380 this will enable him to exit with some grace and save the political process from internal strains and uncertainty
4924381 is the exclusive domain of the two houses of the parliament in a joint session after notice is given to the speaker of the national assembly or chairman of the senate as set out in article 47 of the constitution
4924382 before the joint session to respond to the charges or do so through his representative
4924383 musharraf can turn his removal into a messy affair but this will not salvage his position he needs to make the much needed move of bowing to public opinion his civilian and military friends who have no personal axe to grind need to advise him to opt for a graceful exit rather than to go through the impeachment process

4924397 we will reduce our co2 footprint but we will not compromise on the ability of our vehicles to tackle the toughest conditions
4924398 as well as new powertrain and transmission technologies we will also be looking to reduce the weight and size of our vehicles and you will also see a step change in terms of aerodynamics
4924399 stop start will be introduced on the freelander diesel later this year and that alone will reduce the co2 emissions from 194g km to 179g km

4924414 millions of cds are pressed to hold windows or mac os
4924415 microsoft is an usa company and its success is great for the american economy but if you dont live in the usa when you buy propietary software eg windows about a half of the money goes directly to the software companys hq eg microsofts that money leaves your country while the other half stays in sales commissions etc no technical benefits your country is not producing anything and you dont even need qualified people to sell boxes that leads to it professionals with no high level knowledge who only install and configure proprietary software without the option of modifying learning customizing it with free software eg linux the economy and it professionals knowledge of your country could improve since there could be a lot of small medium companies customizing solutions providing support consulting etc people who know how to do things and retain money in your country will benefit from it rather than people who just sell boxes with a predefined sales pitch sending your money offshore leaving it professionals without real knowledge about how things work

4924420 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4924421 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4924422 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour

4924448 daniel reneau who coldly murdered kriss keeran in the early morning hours of january 2 1996 has already been executed by the state of texas for this senseless act
4924449 nevertheless on august 21 2008 the state seeks to execute jeffery wood for the same crime even though the state does not contend that mr wood shot keeran in fact mr wood was not even in the building when reneau shot and killed keeran

4924483 its a long way from a desktop study on geological potential to producing reserves
4924484 the risk of a catastrophic offshore spill is quite enhanced in the arctic
4924485 the arctic ecosystem is too fragile for the extraction of natural resources that threatens to destroy the sustainability of the ecosystem so we should leave it relatively untouched
4924486 the potential of uncovering vast reserves of natural resources is too great to pass up for canada and that the ecosystem can be protected through careful regulation and supervision so we should push ahead

4924556 the ubiquity and familiarity of tobacco advertising and promotion may contribute to an environment in which tobacco use is perceived by users to be socially acceptable or at least less socially objectionable and less hazardous than it is in fact
4924557 the most comprehensive review of both the direct and indirect mechanisms concluded that the collective empirical experiential and logical evidence makes it more likely than not that advertising and promotion activities do stimulate cigarette consumption
4924558 year to year variations in advertising expenditure within countries there are many studies of this type both for the uk and for other countries particularly the us details of the analysis vary from one study to another but the basic approach is to model the demand for tobacco products by relating annual changes in consumption to corresponding changes in advertising expenditure and in other variables such as price and income some studies have found that advertising has a statistically significant effect on consumption others including our own study have not there are several possible reasons for failure to find a statistically significant effect of advertising including data imperfections and the inherent difficulty of identifying the separate effect of advertising when this is only one of many potential influences on smoking behaviour taken together however the studies point to a more decisive result because the studies differ in specification and data a range of results is always to be expected if however advertising genuinely has no effect on consumption it would also be expected that the number of studies reporting positive and negative results would be much the same in other words some studies would show that advertising increases consumption but others that advertising reduces consumption in practice this symmetry is not observed the great majority of results point in the same direction towards a positive impact the balance of evidence thus supports the conclusion that advertising does have a positive effect on consumption
4924559 presumably relate to the least productive slice of expenditure on the reasonable assumption that advertising is subject to diminishing returns
4924560 advertising is directly related to the number of cigarettes smoked increased advertising means more cigarettes smoked and less advertising means fewer smoked
4924561 though there are qualifications for example the bans in canada and new zealand are relatively recent and so may not yet have had their full impact the current evidence available on these four countries indicates a significant effect in each case the banning of advertising was followed by a fall in smoking on a scale which cannot reasonably be attributed to other factors
4924562 fda finds that the international experience provides empirical evidence that restrictions on tobacco advertising when given appropriate scope and when fully implemented will reduce cigarette and smokeless tobacco use among children and adolescents under the age of 18
4924563 tobacco advertising is characterized by images and themes that are especially appealing to adolescents and some are appealing to children in addition a large proportion of promotional expenditures associate use of tobacco with activities and products that are attractive to children and youths the sheer amount of expenditures for advertising and promotion assures that young people will be exposed to these messages on a massive scale it is clear that societys efforts to discourage young people from smoking are obstructed and perhaps fatally undermined by the industrys efforts to portray their dangerous products in a positive light
4924564 children who approved of cigarette advertising were twice as likely to become smokers as children who disapproved with the smoking behaviour of those who were ambivalent about advertising falling between that of the other two groups
4924565 if one of your best friends were to offer you a cigarette would you smoke
4924566 what is the name of the cigarette brand of your favorite cigarette advertisement
4924567 of all the cigarette advertisements you have seen which do you think attracts your attention the most
4924568 if you wanted to buy a pack of cigarettes tomorrow what brand do you think that you would buy
4924569 have you ever bought or received for free any product which promotes a tobacco brand or was distributed by a tobacco company
4924570 do you think that you would ever use a tobacco industry promotional item such as a t shirt
4924571 the baseline receptivity in 1993 to tobacco industry promotional activities was strongly related to which adolescents progressed toward smoking
4924572 these studies are evidence that when considered together form a coherent pattern that establishes the role that advertising plays in young peoples smoking behavior
4924573 billboards street car signs and placards and such are in a class by themselves advertisements of this sort are constantly before the eyes of observers on the streets and in street cars to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition on their part other forms of advertising are ordinarily seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer the young people as well as the adults have the message of the billboard thrust upon them by all the arts and devices that skill can produce in the case of newspapers and magazines there must be some seeking by the one who is to see and read the advertisement the radio can be turned off but not so the billboard or street car placard these distinctions clearly place this kind of advertisement in a position to be classified so that regulations or prohibitions may be imposed upon all within the class

4924577 are located on primary and secondary streets where traffic volumes are high provide complete and instantaneous coverage of the market deliver exposures to both residents as well as commuter traffic create rapid consumer top of mind awareness and provide continuous presence up to 18 hours every day
4924578 it takes a combination of 164 poster panels to achieve a daily circulation number of impressions equal to fifty percent of chicagos population showings can be specialized to reach various niches within the overall market
4924579 outdoor advertising displays are giant dramatic and visible their presence in the market ensures nearly everyone will be exposed to them they generate massive awareness of an advertising message outdoor reaches a highly mobile audience where people live work and socialize
4924580 a billboard is a constant fixture in a neighborhood it looms over children every day while they walk to school and every time they play in their neighborhood thus forming an inescapable part of their daily life
4924581 please tell me the ways that you might have seen or heard about this character
4924582 fda recognizes that advertising may not be the most important factor in a childs decision to smoke however the studies cited by the agency establish that it is a substantial contributing and therefore material factor

4924606 when you have an important point to make dont try to be subtle or clever use a pile driver hit the point once then come back and hit it again then hit it a third time a tremendous whack
4924607 puns are little plays on words that a certain breed of person loves to spring on you and then look at you in a certain self satisfied way to indicate that he thinks that you must think that he is by far the cleverest person on earth now that benjamin franklin is dead
4924608 advertising did not invent the products or services which called forth jobs nor inspire the pioneering courage that built factories and machinery to produce them what advertising did was to stimulate ambition and desire the craving to process which is the strongest incentive to produce to satisfy this craving the factory was impelled to turn itself into a growing factory and then by the pressure of mass demand into many factories mass production made possible mass economies reflected in declining prices until the product that began as the luxury of the rich became the possession of every family that was willing to work
4924609 you cant move so fast that you try to change the mores faster than people can accept it that doesnt mean you do nothing but it means that you do the things that need to be done according to priority
4924610 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4924611 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4924612 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it

4924624 ncra has become instead a pretend railroad existing primarily to garner federal and state funds as those involved including hauser during his brief tenure as ncras chief executive insist that an operating railroad will emerge someday

4924637 if you kill enough americans you can change u s policy

4924692 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

4924715 putting bilateral relations at a normal footing at israels expense
4924716 there have been no firm agreements or understandings or any kind of concerted work
4924717 the negotiating track is open there are contacts between the parties
4924718 according to foreign media israel is active inside iranian territory
4924719 some of the 40 000 rockets of syrian and iranian manufacture can hit israeli targets as far south as beersheba 350 kilometres away from hezbollah launching pads north of lebanons litani river not only has tel aviv come within range but hizbollah and the palestinian hamas in gaza with their ideological weltanschauung view of the world can between them cover most of israel except for its southern most tip at eilat on the red sea using these two surrogates tehran can therefore make war on israel and keep its hands clean
4924720 there is no military political or moral justification to initiate war with iran a constant flow of information bears witness to the fact that the israeli government is seriously considering attacking iran in order to disrupt its nuclear plans we do not disregard irresponsible actions by the iranian government we also oppose atomic weapons in principle and support the elimination of all weapons of mass destruction from the region however it is clear that the main source of the immediate danger of a new widespread war stems from the policies of the israeli government and the flow of threats from it backed by provocative military manoeuvres after serious consideration we reiterate our position that all the arguments for such an attack are without any security political or moral justification israel might get caught up in an act of adventurism that could endanger our very existence and this without any serious effort to exhaust the political and diplomatic alternatives to armed conflict we are not certain that such an attack will occur but the very fact that it is being weighed as a reasonable option makes it imperative that we warn and caution against the destructive results of an offensive strike against iran

4924742 she changes everything she touches and everything she touches changes
4924743 there is still a significant amount of cdo collateralised debt obligation instruments out there that are still to be brought to account
4924744 many estimates are that theres possibly another half trillion dollars of that to come to account
4924745 we are not really going to see a significant level of confidence build up in markets until we get through probably a couple of quarters of non surprises
4924746 if you look at the performance over the year its been a pretty solid one
4924747 global funding has been a real issue so theres been quite a significant increase in funding costs
4924748 looking forward to the interest rate cuts that are forecast for next month
4924749 those banks that have taken a more cautious or a more prudent approach in their lending are seeing the benefits of that
4924750 the business is a good business but it does have a number of complex parts
4924751 when you look the funding requirements theres a significant capital injection that would have to be made in order to appropriately capitalise the entity
4924752 the biggest thing is nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4924753 its my first elvis week im a little ashamed to say that but it is
4924754 we watched it on the computer last year and i finally said i have to be part of that
4924755 but when we come down here we rarely see people we know yall need to come out
4924756 i have a velvet elvis but because of the rain we couldnt bring out all of our good stuff

4924759 heres a woman thats successful takes care of herself looks amazing and she took the steps to get there it doesnt happen unless you take charge shes a great role model for many many women
4924760 when i was in my 30s 50 just seemed so ancient to me
4924761 i was in high school when she hit it big
4924762 now that her first young fans are in their 30s we look at madonna as sort of a harbinger of the future for us and the future looks pretty good
4924763 is that aging is not the inevitability that we might have assumed by watching our fathers now in their 50s and 60s madonna is proof that exercising and eating right at an early age pays off
4924764 i want to know who her doctor is its really hard to believe shes 50 she looks 40 and she just keeps going at it living life and loving life
4924765 put a picture of a 50 year old woman today next to one from my mothers generation
4924766 we look at least 10 to 15 years younger than they did
4924767 also 50 really is a new beginning for so many women
4924768 many have accomplished a number of their goals already their children are getting older for the first time they can really think about themselves and ask what do i want from life
4924769 as the cliche goes i guess its better than the alternative
4924770 i just dont feel like what 50 should feel like
4924771 i remember my grandmother at 50 her hair was completely white my mother too was just at a very different place in her life than i am now
4924772 shes done a remarkable job of marketing herself and shes always been able to reinvent herself
4924773 im sure shes happy to be an inspiration to women and men of any age
4924774 is not quite the benchmark for her as it seems to be in the media who have been talking about her 50th since she turned 40

4924783 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4924784 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4924785 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4924786 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4924802 what song is your favorite that pulls at your heart strings any time you hear it
4924803 ive been giving some thought to doing this musical meme youve got me thinking about it again
4924804 welcome i hope you do post on this meme im so glad you like the song
4924805 in many dreams ive held you near now at last youre really here
4924806 saya melihat ada unsur uji coba di sini ajang puteri indonesia 2005 red wajah indo dimenangkan mungkin dengan maksud menuruti selera pasar tapi ternyata muka western nggak ngaruh
4924807 mayong yang sudah lama mengikuti miss universe sedih karena nadine enggak masuk 20 besar dia mengira nadine bisa lolos ke top 20
4924808 mestinya puteri indonesia yang ke sana ke miss universe red membawa nilai nilai lokal agar ada peluang untuk bernegosiasi contoh soal busana renang bisa minta tak pakai bikini tapi ini kan tidak dilakukan bukannya saya iri yang disesalkan nadine terlalu indo mestinya puteri indonesia kan memperlihatkan eksotika timur
4924809 itu wajah lokal saya aja masih ada darah belanda lihat miss japan yang jadi runner up i dia ada di area global tanpa meninggalkan budaya lokal masih pakai hormat dengan membungkuk khas orang jepang dia tak pura pura kebarat baratan meski belajar salsa juga
4924810 saya kasihan sama nadine karena mau nggak mau menanggung malu kita kalau mau mengirim orang lihat lihat dulu bahasa inggris kenyataannya bukan bahasa kedua karena di negara kita bahasa kedua adalah bahasa daerah jadi berhentilah ngata ngatain nadine kalau dia nggak cukup baik bahasa inggrisnya mestinya kan didampingi penerjemah
4924811 indo atau tidak indonesia realitanya sekarang seperti itu banyak darah campuran atau blaster red muka indonesia tapi kalau kelakuannya jelek buang sampah sembarangan percuma juga yang penting citra perempuan indonesia ada padanya
4924812 nggak usah malu nggak bisa bahasa inggris yang penting kepribadian dia sebagai bangsa indonesia terlihat nggak tak kalah penting nadine pergi enggak ada devisa yang berkurang dan enggak ada bom meledak
4924813 miss japan 2005 sama sekali tak bisa bahasa inggris karena itu bukan prioritas utama baginya itu bukan kendala untuk berkomunikasi dengan sesama finalis bahasa inggris hanya menyempurnakan saya malah salut pada usaha nadine untuk belajar bahkan saat berangkat dia sudah yakin dengan kemampuannya berbahasa inggris
4924814 mereka disatukan oleh bahasa hati bukan verbal ketika para finalis bicara dengan bahasanya sendiri sendiri itu malah memperkaya dan jadi keindahan tersendiri di kuping saya
4924815 the instances of applicants securing jobs giving false information is not new but the situation has now reached new heights in the it sector which has forced the leading it firms like tcs satyam cognizant and others to take a tough stand
4924816 im crazy for you touch me once and youll know its true
4924817 were going to have to tell people sorry but you should have come earlier the need around a place like elkton is so great that were probably going to leave feeling overwhelmed
4924818 you spend a lot of your day doing well baby checks and giving out tetanus shots because people cant or wont go see a doctor
4924819 youre wasting your time waiting until someones tooth rots out of their head or that cough becomes pneumonia so they go to the er the most expensive place where they get the least personal care
4924820 the key is going to be finding those people and actually getting them here
4924821 they say i need glasses how am i going to afford all that
4924822 the problem we have is that health care in this country is a for profit industry and theres no profit to be made in smaller communities where there are fewer patients and the ones you see tend to be older sicker and less able to pay
4924823 the best health care is comprehensive and ongoing a relationship that you think about even when youre not sick
4924824 no were not drawing a crowd but if we do what i want were never really going to be in a place to draw a crowd what matters is that we help some people
4924825 you could see what the conditions were like anything could happen out there and it kind of did so i think it was the right strategy for those conditions and it was working very well until the breeze died out so it was mightily frustrating
4924826 the first beat was all about just trying to maximise the gain but as soon as i got past the windward mark i could see what was coming because the breeze was slowly getting lighter and lighter
4924827 i was just praying that the breeze would fill back in again but it didnt and unfortunately they had to abandon the race
4924828 of course it would be nice if we had a decent wind and we could have a decent race
4924829 but even if that race had finished it was not a great race and not great conditions so i think its frustrating for the organisers the sailors and the spectators
4924830 it was just a case of taking things as they came and sailing the best we could throughout the regatta
4924831 we were lucky enough to bring ourselves from the death a couple of times and maintain our lead once we got to the front obviously its a lot easier to maintain it once youre at the front and it went well
4924832 it doesnt get any better than this its great to have done our bit for australia
4924833 were raw in some positions but it was a good test
4924834 we saw what we need to work on and what we did well
4924835 plush toys prevailed on a trademark infringement and unfair competition claim against two defendants and moved for attorneys fees based on the contention that this was an
4924836 court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party
4924837 it would be the same as if in 1946 the german government said lets put up a statue to the victims of the holocaust and said lets be done with that
4924838 look 99 percent of survivors might think this is stupid and meaningless
4924839 but there might be a few people who say this is everything to me and then for them it would be worthwhile
4924840 its easy for church officials to make symbolic gestures like this in part without being cynical because its good pr
4924841 but prayers and memorials are not a substitute for real concrete change
4924842 so its important psychologically for some to get any kind of validation
4924843 so we wanted something that wouldnt make people go inside
4924844 its smooth on top but below its very rough which is like a lot of survivors
4924845 and its a man made break its trying to come together but it cant ever heal completely
4924846 i think the important part about it is that it exists
4924847 its a physical statement and its going to be really hard to pull this up and pretend it wasnt there
4924848 theyre going to be hanging over the back of our house and now theres the medical thing
4924849 all these problems were resolved as soon as these people got away from the turbines got in the car and drove away from the house
4924850 weve had a number of other wind farms over the country and residents living by them and never had any problems
4924851 when you come home from work everything drains away from you because its so quiet and peaceful
4924852 now we are going to have to listen to those windmills whoosh whoosh whoosh
4924853 mama this is the first time i have been pain free this medicine just might really help me
4924854 this is a wonderful medicine used appropriately but an unforgiving medicine used inappropriately
4924855 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4924856 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics

4924860 obama jeopardized u s national security in 2006 obama and raila odinga of kenya
4924861 odinga was jailed for a total of eight years on separate occasions by former president moi for protesting against one party rule after the coup bid he was briefly charged with treason before fleeing to norway for a brief period of exile
4924862 the goat herder claim has been repeated endlessly it is a lie fact obamas grandfather hussein onyango obama was a prominent and wealthy farmer his son obamas father was a child of privilege not privation he was an outstanding student not a herdsman fiction obama was given an african name fact obama is a muslim who has concealed his religion his grandfather was named hussein that is an arabic muslim not african name hussein was a devout muslim and named his son barack senior baraka baraka is an arabic word meaning blessed baraka comes out of the koran and arabic not africa barack senior was also a devoted muslim and also chose a muslim name for his son our own barack obama junior again his name was an arabic and koranic fiction obama senior was a harmless student immigrant who came to the united states only to study fact obama was part of one of the most corrupt and violent organizations in africa the kenyatta regime obamas father ran back to kenya soon after the british left it is likely obamas father had mau mau sympathies or connections or he would not have been welcomed into the murderous inner circle of rapists murderers and arsonists
4924863 interestingly obama hasnt mentioned his kenyan intervention during his campaign throughout new hampshire and his staff has done little to publicize his actions
4924864 presenting morris in nairobi late last year odinga announced that the american would serve as his chief campaign strategist he had to beat a retreat after local media exposed morris as the republican who moonlighted for the bill clinton campaign before being fired for allowing a prostitute to eavesdrop on his conversation with the former american president that was the last that was heard publicly of morris although he is listed to have donated 165 000 kenyan pounds to the odm campaign kitty in pro bono services
4924865 representing nairobis kibera slum one of africas largest odinga projects himself as a champion of the poor but he has a large business empire and falls squarely into kenyas wealthy elite
4924866 sheikh abdukeder albakari one of the richest families in saudi arabia with interests in petroleum drilling petroleum exploration and export in the middle east asia usa and africa through the saudi contacts raila was initiated into the lucrative world of oil business and soon enough he had joined the league of gig independent oil importers via his firm pan african petroleum limited also helped raila make a quick buck in the oil business was a concessionary petroleum deal he struck with the al bakri group where he was not only incorporated as a silent partner in the local arm of al bakri international but was also supplied with petroleum products from saudi arabia at subsidized prices which his firm would sell in the market at normal prices that way raila was able to deftly beat the competition in oil business by occasional price undercutting while still energy minister raila re established and nurtured his links with the libyan government of colonel muammar gadaffi where again he not only did good business in oil importation but also got substantial material support during the 2002 general elections that libyans south africans and nigerians had enough confidence in raila to channel campaign funds through him although he himself was not a presidential in 2002 is an indication of how highly regarded he is in some international circles ethanol raila struck a lucrative deal with energem whereby the canadian firm bought 55 per cent of the kisumu molasses plant sources say that the odinga family was paid over us 5 million about kshs 420 million to relinquish the control of the molasses plant the odinga family had paid only kshs 3 6 million for the property the canadians also ploughed in millions of dollars to rehabilitate the plant and it is today one of the largest manufacturing concerns in the country employing hundreds of people and producing at least 60 000 litres of industrial ethanol for local consumption and export ethanol from the kisumu molasses plant is used as a fuel additive in east and central africa among other products coming out of the plant include yeast carbon dioxide alcohol and related industrial products
4924867 odm whose presidential candidate mr raila odinga is now the prime minister spent sh1 2 billion odm kenya whose presidential candidate is now the vice president mr kalonzo musyoka spent sh157 million
4924868 but the figures were immediately disputed by odm publicity secretary mr salim lone who said the actual figure though not available was far lower
4924869 the report says that the 2007 general election was the most competitive in the countrys history recording one of the highest voter turn out
4924870 the obama ayers top ten highlights of the 20 year obama ayers connection
4924871 if senator obama really has friends like this he and all of us too had better beware
4924872 obama responded by saying he has met khalidi and spoken with him in an academic context when obama was teaching at the university of chicago
4924873 palmer ayers dorhn and young are much more than previously described the evidence assembled in this report suggests that these individuals and many more are part of a network of people with socialist and or communist connections who have been a key part of obamas life and career
4924874 at least one advisor on education policy to the obama campaign advocates a form of reparations to black and other minority americans for hundreds of years of alleged
4924875 the william ayers plan to turn americas school children into maoists and how barack obama helped him
4924876 commonwealth edison is the same company that boasts the well connected thomas ayers bills father as its former ceo mr ayers also served as chair of the board of trustees of commonwealth edison after his tenure as ceo so you can easily imagine he had a hand in selecting mr clark as ceo
4924877 i also know bill ayers he worked with me in shaping our now nationally renowned school reform program
4924878 ayers obama philanthropy corruption what big media refuses to disclose about obamas checkered past in chicago machine politics
4924879 chicago based palestinian american activist and co founder of electronic intifada a pro palestinian online publication
4924880 an article has appeared on the ism affiliated website electronic intifada ei by one of its co founders ali abunimah in which abumimah recounts his close past working relationship with obama prior to the presidential campaign and how abunimah believes obama is merely giving lip service to the jewish community to get elected and that once in office he will work for the palestinian cause
4924881 professor edward said and mariam said at may 1998 arab community event in chicago at which edward said gave the keynote speech
4924882 action provoked criticism from some columbia faculty and students as well as from the anti defamation league
4924883 for anyone who cares about the sorry mess we are in this book is essential indeed necessary reading
4924884 robert malley an obama foreign policy advisor has penned numerous opinion articles many of them co written with a former advisor to the late palestinian authority president yasser arafat petitioning for dialogue with hamas and blasting israel for policies he says harm the palestinian cause
4924885 the hamas delegation in cairo was headed by gaza leaders mahmoud zahar and said siyam zayer said that carters meetings with its leaders will boost the groups legitimacy despite criticism by israel and the u s government
4924886 brzezinski 79 stepped into the crossfire this summer when he published an essay in the summer issue of the journal foreign policy defending a controversial new book about the power of the
4924887 zbigniew is in many ways the creator of the public relations image profile now being used by obama in his quest for the white house an image that is developed in zbigs latest book second chance

4924891 a federal jury found rezko guilty on 16 of 24 counts in a trial that exposed an ingrained culture of corruption in illinois

4924893 he is under invesigation for setting up a deal to loot iraqs powerplants with rezko
4924894 pyongyang favors obama because he has vowed to meet leaders of rogue states such as the north korean leader without conditions if elected
4924895 ill stand with the muslims if the political winds shift in an ugly direction
4924896 the most brilliant propagandist technique will yield no success unless one fundamental principle is borne in mind constantly it must confine itself to a few points and repeat them over and over

4924917 the water bomber helicopters will allow the queensland fire and rescue service to fight fires from the skies
4924918 over the past two queensland bushfire seasons these contracted aircraft took to the skies for approximately 185 hours playing a crucial role in our bushfire response
4924919 a trained air operations officer accompanies the flight crew and provides strategic advice for qfrs ground operations
4924920 the water bombing aircraft have proven to be very effective in providing strong support to ground operations and they will continue to be an important asset to fire fighting efforts in the years to come

4924923 the recognition is nice but it doesnt change the focus or hunger this football team has
4924924 no bowl or championship is won in august our players understand that and they know the next step in making our goals a reality is finishing up training camp strong and then getting ready for bowling green
4924925 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4924926 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4924927 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4924928 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4924929 i thought richie played outstandingly said henry about his skipper who only returned to rugby a few weeks ago after sitting out the dunedin game with an injury
4924930 but the whole loose trio were excellent i thought jerome kaino had his best game yet while rodney sooialo is always superb
4924931 we showed some real skill out there in defence the guys positional play was excellent said henry
4924932 they showed guts against a very physical team mccaw said his teams tackling effort especially in the first 20 minutes when south africa asked a lot with ball in hand set the tone for their performance
4924933 we gang tackled them and knocked them back said mccaw
4924934 its no use crying over spilt milk said coach peter de villiers
4924935 for the game i want them to play its going to take some time for them to gel and click
4924936 we want to play a quick game with quick ball and the guys have to stop being afraid to do that its going to be tough along the way but the more confident the guys get the better theyll be
4924937 we created a lot of opportunities and didnt take them and thats disappointing he said
4924938 i know from a west coast eagles point of view as players in the playing group there is no way you go out there to lose games of footy
4924939 last year and the year before when we were in the finals we hear about other teams and the same question getting raised to them
4924940 the question would have been raised regardless of the result but i suppose that is something the afl has in place in their rules and we are just playing to the rules if thats the way the draft works and theyre the concessions then thats the way it is
4924941 if it comes across as tanking it is very disappointing we dont go out there to lose any games we never do
4924942 we felt for him as a player group because we really let him down
4924943 to have to go an answer questions about tanking and these kind of suggestions is disappointing
4924944 were all under pressure at the moment and to put john under pressure like that is disappointing
4924945 over previous years weve been able to sprinkle in younger guys and mix them with guys who have played a bit more footy and keep our main core group out on the field
4924946 this year we would have had a lot of changes every week and not so much luck on the injury front as well
4924947 i also think at times we havent been able to field our best side and put our best foot forward

4924963 i did project believe with usada where i purposely wanted to do more tests to prove that people can question all they want but the facts are facts and i have the results to prove it
4924964 the international knew that there were allegations of impropriety many years ago this is not news to them
4924965 to be honest you kind of think about all the bad things that could happen to you
4924966 you dont want to go two thirds of an inning and be all over the place in that aspect im happy i was able to get a win
4924967 i was impressed with how he bounced back from that first inning
4924968 he got through a very tough part of the order in the fifth
4924969 that was a great sign when his pitch count was rising and he was probably tiring he hung in there
4924970 it was kind of strange because with the first hitter you have some anxiety and nerves
4924971 but i got him on two pitches then i started to miss the zone and i had to struggle i think i was trying too hard
4924972 we scored three runs early and couldnt polish him off
4924973 luckily i was able to flare the ball for a hit
4924974 my mechanics are a little off and i have to work on that
4924975 i fell behind too many hitters its frustrating because its usually been one inning
4924976 we had previously demonstrated that grp stimulates the growth of this particular cancer
4924977 this time we wanted to demonstrate the opposite effects by targeting grp receptors in neuroblastoma to see if we could make the cancer regress
4924978 we wanted to see how these neuroblastoma cells would behave whether they would grow and or metastasize to the liver but instead tumour growth was significantly attenuated

4925017 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
4925018 we can be quite certain that the decline in rainfall has been substantial and will continue to be

4925022 at first we had no idea what it was it could have been in our solar system or at the edge of the universe
4925023 we think that in the recent past the galaxy ic 2497 hosted an enormously bright quasar
4925024 because of the vast scale of the galaxy and the voorwerp light from that past still lights up the nearby voorwerp even though the quasar shut down sometime in the past 100 000 years and the galaxys black hole itself has gone quiet
4925025 from the point of view of the voorwerp the galaxy looks as bright as it would have before the black hole turned off its this light echo that has been frozen in time for us to observe
4925026 its rather like examining the scene of a crime where although we cant see them we know the culprit must be lurking somewhere nearby in the shadows
4925027 the strange hannys voorwerp looks like it could be the nearest example of a luminous quasar
4925028 ic 2497 is so close that if the quasar was still shining today on a good night you could probably see it with a small
4925029 this discovery really shows how citizen science has come of age in the internet world
4925030 hannys attentiveness alerted us not only to a peculiar object but to a window into the cosmic past which might have eluded us for a long time otherwise trying to understand the processes operating here has proven to be a fascinating challenge involving a whole range of astrophysical techniques and instruments around the world and beyond this has also been some of the most rewarding astronomy ive done in years
4925031 when we launched galaxy zoo we were overwhelmed as was the internet portal initially with the outpouring of public interest and volunteer input
4925032 its amazing to think that this object has been sitting in the archives for decades and that amateur volunteers can help by spotting things like this online
4925033 it was a fantastic present to find out on my 25th birthday that we will get observational time on the hubble space telescope to follow up this discovery

4925046 things are slowing down to the point where i dont think developers can put up new buildings without an anchor tenant
4925047 although owners are cautious they realize now is a good time to go forward with projects the cost of materials is going up quite significantly
4925048 i dont have good finishes at those race tracks that include couple of road courses and pocono
4925049 it is just typically not a good part of the season where we have run very good we are always strong at the races the first third and last third of the season
4925050 i am looking forward to the last third of the season
4925051 we seem to do really well at all them race tracks we seem to gain a lot of points or have the ability to gain a lot of points in those two stretches the first and last part of the season i figured the summer would be rough and it was i dont know why that is other than there arent any favorite race tracks of mine in that little stretch
4925052 we tried the best we could to get through that stretch pretty good and do better
4925053 i dont know i wasnt no happier about it than i have been in the past starting here at michigan we will start to see some improvement and start a run like we have been running at the start of the year like i think we are capable of doing

4925061 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4925062 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4925063 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it

4925073 their forelimbs and shoulders are heavily muscled and the forepaws have long sharp retractile claws enabling them to grab and hold prey once contact is made the skull is foreshortened thus increasing the shearing leverage of the powerful jaws the tongue is coated with sharp pointed papillae which retain and lacerate food and rip flesh off a carcass large canines are used to bring down and hold prey
4925074 they showed in the second half the quality they have on the ball now they just have to settle down and get used to the system
4925075 if he keeps scoring like this i would have paid 10m for him and i would have been right to do so
4925076 if he keeps scoring like that then i would have paid 10million for him and i think i would have been right to do that
4925077 billy didnt get a run in the team and sometimes it takes time to step up a division and establish yourself and understand how defenders are better
4925078 billy can like all youngsters get a bit carried away he does want to learn and he wants to be successful for sheffield united but hes got to learn how to handle that
4925079 you need to put a smile on peoples faces even through gritted teeth
4925080 were one of the biggest teams on the planet so its bizarre
4925081 although we pressed in the second half we fell to another set piece which really sticks in the throat
4925082 i think weve got enough ability to cope but we dont want to overreact because weve had a mad 20 minutes today sheffield united official site gaffers relief at win
4925083 its always a relief to get the first league win under the belt and we did it in style at times in a very solid team performance from paddy outwards we were on top of our game
4925084 our players acquitted themselves well got at rangers early and billys goals were so well taken he could have been taking two matchballs home with the chances we created
4925085 billys running off the ball was fantastic and it was his best display for us by a country mile but it was possible because the hold up play of darius henderson was first class he led their centre backs a merry dance they couldnt beat him in the air and when they tried to close him down they couldnt stop him bringing people in either i think today people will see just why i brought him here
4925086 i know some people thought that we should have sat back and closed the game down late on but i didnt want to shut up shop i wanted us to try and create to score goals and to excite people and the fans didnt leave today
4925087 there may well be occasions when we might feel it right to shut up shop but i felt today that we could go on and do even better
4925088 chris had his ankles clipped as he cleared the ball and unfortunately took a knock on the head as he fell he was concussed and cant remember anything so he is having a scan straight away
4925089 that is a concern for me because he might not be allowed to play again for ten days because of the concussion injury and we have blackpool to play next week
4925090 it was 12 minutes of madness and we gave ourselves a mountain to climb
4925091 we let ourselves down and we let the fans down
4925092 we were caught out defensively from two set pieces which is bizarre
4925093 we knew what they were going to do we had it up on the wall in the dressing room but they caught us out and that disappoints me
4925094 were amongst the largest teams in the championship in terms of our size which makes it more frustrating to concede from set pieces we need to work on it
4925095 weve got to get out of the traps quicker win that first header win that first tackle and build from there
4925096 we forced kenny into a couple of saves and hit the post as well
4925097 but the fact is that when you have to chase a game like we had to youre going to be open at the back
4925098 theyre going to take time to get used to the system we play but they have already shown what quality players they are
4925099 the expectation surrounding the club is something were going to have to cope with

4925106 a full generation after aids emerged as a recognizable disease having sex still poses the same risk for hiv infection or reinfection having a sexual encounter with another person a central meaningful activity in most peoples lives has been shadowed by fear by the prospect of a long term disease and by a whole new reason for guilt for more than a quarter of a century now how have we allowed this unnatural state of affairs to persist for so long where are the 21st century tools for preventing the sexual transmission of hiv cheap effective and utterly unobtrusive lovers deserve nothing less instead of sinking time effort and money into excavating the fossils of its ancient achievement act up might consider marking its birthday by mounting a fresh drive to remind government and industry that people have a right to sex without fear without being forced to make a choice between pleasure and health its an issue that might actually speak across the divides of generation race gender and sero status and it might regain for the organization some measure of the relevance it once had for the grassroots activists that gave of themselves as if their lives depended on it because they really did
4925107 in the age of the internet we can do much of what we did in our meetings and on the streets on the world wide web
4925108 the information technology available today could help end the need for those endless meetings
4925109 creating a blog could in fact incorporate even more voices and varieties of opinions and ideas than any meeting ever could
4925110 where act up once had chapters in many cities we could now involve thousands more via simple list serves and blogs
4925111 creating a blog would allow for expression and refinement of ideas and policies like a queer justice league for denouncing our enemies
4925112 a well organized website could function as an electronic clearing house for sharing information for posting problems for demanding solutions for developing and communicating action plans
4925113 list serves and a website could coordinate grassroots organizing and mobilize phone e mail and physical zaps or actions

4925123 we really do live in a 24 7 society and its not uncommon to be online and checking email at all hours of the day
4925124 sometimes we need to take a step back and refresh with an empty inbox or even a new inbox altogether to clear our mind and focus on those emails and relationships that are most important to us

4925129 theres a common misunderstanding among all the human beings who have ever been born on the earth that the best way to live is to try to avoid pain and just try to get comfortable you can see this even in insects and animals and birds all of us are the same a much more interesting kind adventurous and joyful approach to life is to begin to develop our curiosity not caring whether the object of our inquisitiveness is bitter or sweet to lead a life that goes beyond pettiness and prejudice and always wanting to make sure that everything turns out on our own terms to lead a more passioante full and delightful life than that we must realize that we can endure a lot of pain and pleasure for the sake of finding out who we are and what this world is how we tick and how our world ticks how the whole thing just is if were committed to comfort at any cost as soon as we come up against the least edge of pain were going to run well never know whats beyond that particular barrier or wall or fearful thing when people start to meditate or to work with any kind of spiritual discipline they often think that somehow theyre going to improve which is a sort of subtle aggression against who they really are but loving kindness maitri toward ourselves doesnt mean getting rid of anything maitri means that we can still be crazy after all these years we can still be angry after all these years we can still be timid or jealous or full of feelings of unworthiness the point is not to try to change ourselves meditation practice isnt about trying to throw ourselves away and become something better its about befriending who we are already the ground of practice is you or me or whoever we are right now just as we are thats the ground thats what we study thats what we come to know with tremendous curiosity and interest
4925130 the mccain camp is building a case about obamas ability to lead and needs to keep the pressure on his weakness with voters

4925135 at what point does a baby get human rights in your view

4925137 one thing that im absolutely convinced of is that there is a moral and ethical element to this issue and so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue is not paying attention
4925138 why the hell is this guy taking a picture of the camera
4925139 setelah agustusan ini kita harapkan awang dan pejabat bpd itu datang
4925140 kita ingin tahu uang di rekening adji itu apa bener dari rekening awang kalau betul sumbernya dari mana dan kenapa bisa seperti itu
4925141 dia sudah aktif lagi jadi bupati cutinya cuma beberapa hari setelah pilgub kemarin
4925142 pak awang di sengata karena besok ada upacara 17 an

4925145 there was nothing we could do but make the best of it
4925146 i dont ever want to deal with a storm like that again believe me it will change your attitude for the worse
4925147 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4925148 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4925149 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4925150 it just played out right in my hand the way the race unfolded my horse put out a great effort and it just worked out perfect i just didnt want to get in too big of a hurry back there and rush him at any time i know he likes to close and he could probably pick them up the way they were battling it just worked out perfect
4925151 shes got a couple of issues with her gait weve got to get her a little smoother so shes handier when she gets in tough thatll hurt her if she doesnt but shes got
4925152 niftys just got to make some adjustments on her i dont think its the track or anything like that its just a learning curve for these young fillies learning how to pace fast
4925153 i was concerned about keeping her pacing around that last turn she got a little bumpy and rough there i was more worried about just keeping her pacing at that point but once she got in the lane and straightened up she kicked home real strong
4925154 i wasnt sure how shed respond against the top fillies tonight
4925155 ill see six nights of track and field before i have to return for a workshop at our national headquarters in indianapolis
4925156 ill be showing our new ceo doug logan around and making sure he gets the right introductions to everyone in the track and field world
4925157 when you can see a 2 year old runner or a 96 year old discus thrower like we have its all still pretty special
4925158 i realized early on that i was way too slow to be a good athlete
4925159 our coach said i need one guy to step forward as manager of our team
4925160 my sophomore year i was meet director of a junior varsity track meet
4925161 i guess i just always had a knack for it
4925162 by the time i got there stan had been fired as coach and demoted to events director
4925163 but i learned a lot about directing events from him
4925164 we have 1 3 million high school student athletes in track and cross country
4925165 and some nine million people run road races and are out training at least 100 days at year
4925166 youll never see an olympic track and field athlete win eight gold medals
4925167 in swimming the skills in the various events translate pretty well but that isnt the case in track
4925168 thats been the thing thats really helped me as a player is finally knowing the system to so well
4925169 knowing the intricacies where i can go out there and react as opposed to thinking where you kind of got your head on a swivel
4925170 today things did kind of slow down for me there and thats a big confidence booster
4925171 and that was a big part to help build confidence for me to go out there and make plays against the no 1 defense and go across the middle
4925172 ive just got to keep working and never be satisfied im just trying to make it as tough as i can on the coaches when its all said and done at the end of camp
4925173 the little guy can play ive said that from the very beginning
4925174 i like the player and his teammates like him and he produces but it is a couple of games and we have a ways to go here
4925175 i was getting kind of fatigued but i knew everyone was counting on me you never know when it is going to be your last time to get that ball so you have to make the most of that opportunity
4925176 fastest growing sports in the world that no one has ever heard of
4925177 it is very simple someone says go and you go
4925178 we are mostly middle aged people in their 30s and 40s we race against teams that are 20 years younger and probably 20 pounds lighter
4925179 we beat them on a regular basis its all about going with the boat it is a very cool feeling when the boat goes
4925180 you will be able to bounce a nickel against your belly
4925181 in the next two weeks you are going to turn into an animal what kind of animal is up to you but its not going to be a bunny rabbit
4925182 if you are embarrassed by being called out in a crowd dont get in my boat
4925183 people get mad at me they call me names i dont care if they become better paddlers i have done my job its all in fun
4925184 he reminds me of my dad trying to teach me eighth grade algebra
4925185 if you dont think you are going to die during a race you arent paddling hard enough
4925186 it is not like baseball and volleyball and you miss the ball if you miss a stroke with your paddle the boat will still go
4925187 you gotta remember at the steel city dragons our charter is to get people in the boat it is not about making people crazy or scared
4925188 anytime you put 20 people in a little container and hand them a stick you sit back and see what happens
4925189 its feeling good they told me my snaps were going to be limited it was good to finally get out there in that environment i got a few plays
4925190 they told me they were going to gradually bring me back into the game i did all right it took a couple of plays to get warmed up youve got to see the type of guy youre playing against i think i made some progress though
4925191 its not even sore i look forward to getting more playing time next week
4925192 i thought he did ok but we were very tentative with him
4925193 we didnt want to leave him in there too much but next week hell get to play a lot we anticipate that but for the most part he did ok its the first time he played in a game
4925194 we just had a number of plays that he was going to be involved in
4925195 he hadnt been rushing in nickel rush you dont want to give him too much too soon he hadnt practiced a lot and we just wanted to give him a couple of snaps
4925196 its difficult to play on the road in altitude i thought we weathered their storm and had good sense of urgency it wasnt for lack of effort our guys always give 100 percent
4925197 we didnt really start off that great but we were even at half collectively as a team when we make a bad pass it seems to be a disease we have to work that out and have guys step up and make sure we play simple
4925198 i was trying to get back into position and i didnt see the ball
4925199 i swung and it hit me in the foot and we both battled and it popped into a good spot for him he took a good touch
4925200 conor casey was a man among boys out there today and the difference in the game
4925201 the field was wet and conditions were tough and it was hard for us to string passes
4925202 its not an excuse we still should have come and do what we need to do to win its not always going to be pretty
4925203 i was able to be a part of three relays where we were able to put up a solid team effort
4925204 we came together as one unit for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well
4925205 especially to be part of something as special as this
4925206 i just think the biggest thing is that nothing is impossible with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination thats something i learned and something that helped me
4925207 theres so much emotion going through my head and so much excitement i guess i kind of just want to see my mom
4925208 i told him hey i was still on my routes
4925209 he was sitting on everything so i told jay when we go against pacman im running a double move
4925210 i wanted that one real bad i want to get back to where i was
4925211 hes like t o hes baby t o but not quite t o
4925212 im not suppose to get taken down by a kicker
4925213 both young tackles did a great job didnt give them a push up front gave me a good pocket
4925214 any time we have that kind of protection and have eddie and b marsh out there its going to be tough to stop us
4925215 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4925216 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4925217 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4925218 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker
4925219 the government and nffs shared vision for overcoming the chronic nationwide shortfall of 22 000 seasonal workers in horticulture should be widely applauded given the benefits for all concerned
4925220 we have to be soldiers to eradicate evil and have humility in how we approach it
4925221 hi how are you are you having a nice day

4925227 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4925228 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4925229 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4925230 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4925231 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4925245 return b and ill verify in the assert that i was passed a
4925246 the recognition is nice but it doesnt change the focus or hunger this football team has
4925247 no bowl or championship is won in august our players understand that and they know the next step in making our goals a reality is finishing up training camp strong and then getting ready for bowling green
4925248 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4925249 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4925250 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4925251 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge

4925304 there really is a lot of tightness in your lower back too and thats a related issue
4925305 so im supposed to be getting ready for the day and i promised my friend i would only write my review of the castro theatre but
4925306 we are so much cooler and better because we dont eat meat

4925320 they said you can take your shoes off this is family stuff so i did
4925321 i have my mom and family here so everybody made me feel comfortable also these shoes hurt
4925322 maybe theyre kind of starting to like something thats not so pre made
4925323 gradually people in japan are listening to more varied music
4925324 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4925325 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4925326 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song
4925327 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4925328 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4925329 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4925330 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here
4925331 soo da ne i like japan but i have to come back here regularly maybe just to get some of the air

4925345 matthews experience points out that each of us from the beginning is one of gods works in progress much of what god has for us he gives long before we are able to consciously respond to him he trusts us with skills and abilities ahead of schedule he has made each of us capable of being his servant mathew couldnt have known that god would use the very skills he had sharpened as a tax collector to record the greatest story ever lived
4925346 we can rejoice too when we run into problems and trials for we know that they help us develop endurance and endurance develops strength of character and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation and this hope will not lead to disappoinment for we know how dearly god loes us because he has given us the holy spirit to fill our hearts with his love
4925347 a bruised reed he will not break and a smouldering wick he will not snuff out in his name the nations will put their trust
4925348 the holy spirit is here describing persons whose grace is at present weak whose repentance is feeble and whose faith is small towards such persons the lord jesus christ will be tender and compassionate weak as the broken reed is it shall not be broken small as the spark of fire may be within the smoking flax it shall not be quenched weak grace weak faith and weak repentance are all precious in our lords sight the doctrine here laid down is full of comfort and consolation there are thousands in every church of christ to whom it ought to speak peace and hope there are some who are ready to despair of their salvation because their strength seems so small they are full of fears and despondency because their knowledge faith hope love seem so dwarfish and diminutive let them drink comfort out of this text let them know that weak faith gives a man as real and true and interest in christ as strong faith there is fire in a spark as truly as in a burning flame

4925359 some of these men have experienced a family breakdown or were not given
4925360 as a result weve found that many enter the later stages in life with difficult family relationships or weaker ties with their children

4925382 our reasons for shifting half blood prince to summer are twofold we know the summer season is an ideal window for a family tent pole release as proven by the success of our last harry potter film which is the second highest grossing film in the franchise behind only the first installment additionally like every other studio we are still feeling the repercussions of the writers strike which impacted the readiness of scripts for other films changing the competitive landscape for 2009 and offering new windows of opportunity that we wanted to take advantage of we agreed the best strategy was to move half blood prince to july where it perfectly fills the gap for a major tent pole release for mid summer

4925422 these regions are a part of georgia and the international community has repeatedly made clear that they will remain so
4925423 they can use their overwhelming regional military power to beat up on a small neighbor

4925486 my name is kathy de plaza and i have been a full time massage therapist for seventeen years i purchased the magnassager when it first came out and it quickly became indispensable to my business so when the elite model was introduced i was anxious to try it out the elite is so versatile and really allows me to do detailing work for my clients with greater ease and efficiency i can get right in to specific areas especially with the snap on accessories now my clients are specifically asking for me to use it in their sessions i use it a lot for work i do on myself too because it comes with a stand to hold it in place while you work on yourself i can release the muscles in areas where i wasnt able to work with the big magnassager this ability is a huge advantage to me so that i can keep my forearms released well enough to support working a full time client base all day and then to play my guitar during my off hours and its small enough to fit in the saddlebags of my motorcycle when i go out of town i highly recommend the elite whether you are a professional massage therapist or a do it yourselfer you wont want to ever be without it once youve experienced the ease of releasing those hard to get to muscles

4925488 forces us to imagine what the scene looked like when people lived in the house and to think about what happened to them
4925489 from my point of view and i am in contact with the french the russians are perhaps already not honouring their word
4925490 russias elite value their ties to europe their shopping and their luxury weekends we should look at the visa regime for russian citizens

4925498 inflation costs have not been addressed by the state funding formulas for three years
4925499 unless the state adjusts the formula well be looking at cutting something
4925500 i believe the finance system needs to be reformed so there is not only an index for inflation which includes gas utilities and insurance costs which are going up for all school districts as well as an ability for the school districts to keep more of their money
4925501 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace patience kindness goodness faithfulness
4925502 not mere consumable opinion the mystical commodity of mediated capitalism but the raw material of a considered judgment whether aesthetic political or ethical in that judgment lies the cure for our affliction

4925506 ik krijg geregeld telefoontjes en mails van jonge mensen die met veel plezier aan hun vakanties met een caravan uit hun kindertijd terugdenken de mensen stoten dan op een oude caravan en willen deze uit pure nostalgie restaureren
4925507 wij beschikken in onze club over een schat aan ervaring en staan deze mensen met raad en daad bij maar soms moeten we hen teleurstellen zeker wanneer er geen papieren meer bij de caravan zijn
4925508 i wanted to do something no one else had done in sport this goes hand in hand with my goal of changing the sport of swimming
4925509 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
4925510 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
4925511 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
4925512 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4925513 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4925514 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
4925515 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
4925516 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4925517 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
4925518 civilians are often arrested violently tortured to the point where they die its really very very sad
4925519 the exit clause is a normal part of transfer negotiations these days its not unusual
4925520 during my time here we have been asked to include exit clauses in contracts but have managed to resist it
4925521 sometimes players ask for an exit clause and less money but we dont have any players at the club who have one
4925522 stiam ca toja e bun dar nu ma asteptam sa fie chiar atat de bun
4925523 a veces mientras camino por las calles y escucho a la gente conversar y pensar me siento tan solo en la ciudad que comienzo a desertar
4925524 its been nothing but an upwards rollercoaster but its been nothing but fun
4925525 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination
4925526 the economy and gas prices are always on your mind but michaels success helps you forget depressing things
4925527 i wanted to put my mind to it and wanted to do something that no one ever did in sport
4925528 this means a lot to my country it means a lot to me
4925529 unfortunately the olympic spirit is not being respected at all by chinese officials in tibet
4925530 civilians are often arrested violently tortured to the point where they die its really very very sad
4925531 from here it is a continuation with my goal of raising the sport of swimming as high as i can in the us 70 000 fans will be watching the relay at the nfl ravens game tonight the team based in his home town of baltimore and it has been shown at sports events across the country
4925532 i have heard people say its crazy they are out to dinner and swimming is on the television for me its still work in progress
4925533 so many people said it couldnt be done but all it takes is an imagination that is something i have learned
4925534 after the 200 im i started to think we could get there that was when i allowed myself to believe a little bit it was pretty exciting
4925535 it has been from getting my hand on the wall and winning by one one hundredth to doing my best times in every event
4925536 it has been nothing but an upward rollercoaster and it has also been nothing but fun
4925537 michael phelps you cant put it in words what he has done here his level of achievement is phenomenal and i dont think it will ever be seen again
4925538 i said before he could win six or seven medals but he would need a bit of luck to get the eight it all lined up for him
4925539 we will fight you we will sue you we will report on your obstruction and law breaking and i will pound you in this column
4925540 i am thrilled to see such fire in the belly of the executive editor of the news amp observer
4925541 as i have written before i feel that the papers highest mission is to be a watchdog of government and advocate for the public interests bravo
4925542 and now along comes cowboy drescher with his guns blazing what i gathered from his diatribe is to hell with professional investigative reporting he is on a vendetta because people in state government are tweaking his arrogance by not asking how fast and how high to jump
4925543 the point i was trying to make was i hope the next governor will not copy the easley model
4925544 and of course the whole point of the column is that were going to fight for public information and thats an important part of what we do
4925545 people are trying to keep us from knowing anything and the public from knowing anything in some cases within the law and in some cases outside the law
4925546 it doesnt take days to forward a request it takes minutes
4925547 i dont expect them to respond to everything in a day there is a test of reasonableness but we dont feel they have met that
4925548 thats absolutely untrue weve been forthcoming with documents associated with central hospital for the last six months
4925549 its been a long time we definitely need to win one it would help morale in here a little bit get things going the right way
4925550 i know its been a lot but i dont really want to know how many
4925551 theres no getting around it were not a very good offense right now but were getting opportunities there are six weeks left hopefully well turn it around were definitely not giving it up
4925552 the opportunities havent been there and when you get them you want to do something
4925553 thats a great hitting team and thats all you want to face you dont want to get cheated the white sox trading him i cant say much about it
4925554 come to the edge we cant we are afraid come to the edge we cant we will fall and they came to the edge and he pushed them and they flew by appolinaire
4925555 que habremos hecho nosotros para que esta gente nos trate tan bien si no somos nada ni tenemos nada que ense ar ni aportar
4925556 oye que yo soy de chiangkhan no soy est pido
4925557 i dont think that he was a strong enough jurist or legal thinker at the time for that elevation
4925558 according to statements given by the defendants the 130 pound steinhauer an honor student started the fight by groping softics girlfriend on the dance floor and then head butting softic and taking a swing at the 6 foot 9 260 pound kovacevic when they confronted him
4925559 thats the way you like to see an offense execute
4925560 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area
4925561 seattle played pretty well but we hurt ourselves for the most part
4925562 quit trying to toot on me so i can brush your teeth
4925563 please dont hug ronis bo bo butt at our house
4925564 hold on now that i have a better angle it looks like its going to be a boy
4925565 not about hating its about having love for yourself love for your race pride within
4925566 my cpa tells me it is not necessary to live together and a divorce can be had after the tax loss is used up
4925567 one of the best moments ive had as a professional
4925568 and ive never seen a draft like the one we just had
4925569 its the single best management team in all of baseball maybe in all of sports and everyone including greg and his staff showed that with what they just accomplished
4925570 even if alvarez hadnt accepted our offer the way the process was conducted was what was important
4925571 it shows the plan that was in place the work that went into it
4925572 ive said from the very beginning that its not going to be about how many dollars we spend
4925573 but we pushed hard and were excited with every single player were adding to the organization
4925574 a good draft wouldnt mean anything if we didnt sign people we really wanted
4925575 the old me wouldnt have been very happy with the new me
4925576 teams dont even make offers until hours before the deadline and in many cases minutes before the deadline
4925577 this deadline creates major administrative problems and for most draft picks it removes almost in its entirety the negotiation process
4925578 there is a much greater chance of this having long term impact than grabbing a piece here or there or a short term fix if we get impatient
4925579 we have a plan its a long term plan its an orderly plan this is where we need to be focusing our energy and investments today
4925580 to some degree thats a decision we make to some degree its a decision the players make as we get enough stability throughout the system enough depth we can not only hold onto players but also strategically build oakland has proven you dont have to hang onto every player forever but to put together a team that can consistently compete with enough depth to support it thats where we need to be
4925581 unfortunately were putting a lot of effort into that bottom tier building that foundation but we all look forward to seeing that percolate up to the major league level
4925582 were approaching a pull the plug kind of decision were funded by venture capital theyre not going to chase a company whose business model has been broken so if it doesnt feel like its headed towards a solution were done
4925583 i feel a little bit bitter but i did my best and i dont have any excuse because i tried hard
4925584 as soon as i saw i had covered the field and i knew i would win i was very happy and i started to celebrate

4925590 i was in the race but i wasnt really involved
4925591 he definitely got out of the blocks well and he drove the way he has been driving all season
4925592 he ran great a lot of people doubted him putting tyson and asafa over him you talk about them but he proved all the critics wrong
4925593 this new research is tremendously exciting as firstly the biological brain controls its own moving robot body and secondly it will enable us to investigate how the brain learns and memorizes its experiences
4925594 this research will move our understanding forward of how brains work and could have a profound effect on many areas of science and medicine
4925595 i now know 2000 ways not to make a light bulb
4925596 yeah thats all fine and good but my life situation is different because
4925597 the correct thought you should have when you see the rich person is good for him and if wealth is one of your goals the next thing you should think is i wonder how he became wealthy followed by i wonder if i can learn that and become wealthy the same way he did
4925598 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the finish line

4925614 the consoles at certain periods are more powerful than the pc but the pc can improve its capacity and ability every year so the cycle changes generally the pc gaming business gets better over time in these console cycles so as we continue this cycle graphically the pcs will continue to get better and the features will become more interesting
4925615 so what do we do well its better not to invest a lot of money on that particular platform
4925616 we know that the developers that are creating the pc game are not going to get paid for the work they do and the games wont break even so we prefer to focus on platforms that maybe have less piracy and where more customers are actually paying for the content they consume
4925617 we greatly reduced the number of people working on pc games because of that
4925618 the pc gaming community is very often against any kind of system that prohibits piracy which i have difficulty understanding they need to help us to make sure we can invest on the pc because if we cant get a return on investment with pc games then we will not invest
4925619 a system that will make sure you have a better experience when you buy than game rather than when you dont buy it

4925646 we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me that basic principle applies to poverty to racism and sexism it applies to not thinking about ladders of opportunity to get in the middle class as wealthy and powerful as we are dont spend enough time thinking about the least of these
4925647 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis i know i dont walk alone i know if i can get myself out of the way i can carry out in some small way what he intends those things that i have on a regular basis will get washed way it also means an sense of obligation to embrace not through just words but deeds the expectations god has for us
4925648 answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade one thing that i am absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical element to this issue anyone who tries to deny the moral gravity of the abortion issue is not paying attention i am pro choice not because im pro abortion but ultimately i do not think women make these decisions causally they wrestle with these things in profound ways
4925649 marriage is the union between a man and a woman for me as a christian it is also a sacred union god is in the mix
4925650 i do believe in civil unions i do believe that for a gay partners to want to visit each other i the hospital and the state says thats alright in no way inhibits what i believe marriage is all about

4925687 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4925688 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

4925698 its been nothing but an upwards roller coaster and its been nothing but fun
4925699 its like 90 yards of a touchdown it was so close but i didnt have much of a response
4925700 its disappointing i didnt win i have no regrets it certainly was a close race

4925703 he can probably hear you if you want to talk to him
4925704 he doesnt remember to call the nurse he doesnt remember why hes here he doesnt remember why these things are attached
4925705 at first he remembered them all but before she left she asked again he could only remember one
4925706 when i saw him on friday i didnt think he was going to make it
4925707 they said they dont allow officers children to become priests
4925708 hes so eager he just wants to go home i told him the only thing he can do is relax and get well then he can take care of things what can he do now anyway

4925731 probably that one decision caused google to be created its not clear we would have done it otherwise
4925732 its impossible to say we would have performed the same way if we hadnt done it
4925733 grant flower stood out in the run chase but the rest of the day was all down to the fight from the team
4925734 it turned out to be a nice toss to lose
4925735 my team were absolutely fantastic today we knew kent would come hard at us and the guys rose to the challenge really well
4925736 kent were obviously still in the game and bowled really well but the guys put together a great run chase
4925737 theres no point getting into finals if you are not going to win them
4925738 i dont think there were many who can put their hands up and say they were got out
4925739 we put ourselves under pressure and have only ourselves to blame we just did not get enough runs
4925740 i dont mind losing when you have put your best game out there but we were very poor with the bat today
4925741 grant flower did really well and our boys probed hard with the ball but our batting let us down
4925742 and i told them the same thing and they laughed
4925743 scully is making the same point everyone else is making
4925744 he says the stats indicate you are having success hitting behind ramirez tell me that isnt the case
4925745 listen im so tired of talking about this stuff it diminishes my whole career and all the hard work i take it as an insult
4925746 im 40 you dont get better when you are 40
4925747 you guys write about things happening in a weeks time thats why we dont like you baseball is a six month game
4925748 what did i hit last year without manny how do you explain that whats my career average what will i be hitting at the end of this season
4925749 manny was only hitting 300 in boston with 20 home runs
4925750 and hes doing way better than that here so im helping manny

4925752 it was long ago and far away in a prison camp in north vietnam
4925753 can i finally say it took a lot of prayer it took a lot of prayer
4925754 grant managed the run chase superbly and in the field we were outstanding as a unit
4925755 there was plenty of fight throughout the whole side and we were absolutely fantastic today
4925756 we knew kent would come hard at us and the guys rose to the challenge really well
4925757 it got a bit easier in the afternoon so it wasnt a bad toss to lose
4925758 we just needed to get some partnerships together because chasing a small total that is what it is all about keeping out the good balls and putting away the bad ones
4925759 from playing a lot of cricket you get used to where the gaps are
4925760 i am not a big strong hitter of the ball over the top so you have to find other ways of manipulating it
4925761 it is definitely a high point for me at essex and as you get older your successes are few and far between so i will definitely take that
4925762 i used to watch these finals a lot i always had a wish to play in one at lords and so it is brilliant that it has come true
4925763 losing is not great although when you get beaten after giving it everything you can give and come up short you accept it
4925764 but when you play that badly with the bat it is just a waste of time turning up all the build up you turn up and bat like that joke
4925765 we were just brainless werent we the shots we played

4925771 analysts said the falls on oil since the middle of this month and on other commodity markets had coincided with some traders unwinding short dollar long oil positions which helped to lift the u s currency to a one month high against the yen

4925812 behold i heard your father speak to your brother esau saying
4925813 now therefore my son listen to me as i command you
4925814 go now to the flock and bring me two choice young goats from there that i may prepare them as a savory dish for your father such as he loves it to your father that he may eat so that he may bless you before his death
4925815 behold esau my brother is a hairy man and i am a smooth man
4925816 perhaps my father will feel me then i will be as a deceiver in his sight and i will bring upon myself a curse and not a blessing

4925829 the days of mourning for my father are near then i will kill my brother jacob
4925830 behold your brother esau is consoling himself concerning you 43
4925831 stay with him a few days until your brothers fury subsides 45 until your brothers anger against you subsides and he forgets what you did to him then i will send and get you from there why should i be bereaved of you both in one day

4925833 tijdens het familiediner op zondag heeft mijn moeder vaak genoeg geroepen stop met smurf praten
4925834 axelle zette haar de rode muts op omdat vrouwen meer de macht moeten nemen en gaf haar een mini jurk omdat vrouwen vrouwelijk moeten mogen blijven verder ziet ze eruit als een afrikaanse vrouw axelle trekt zich als ambassadrice voor unicef het lot van de afrikaanse vrouwen aan op 23 oktober de vijftigste verjaardag van de smurfen zullen we de beroemdheidssmurfen veilen de opbrengst gaat integraal naar unicef
4925835 het succes van de smurfen is formidabel we hebben vijftig jaar goed geboerd en ik vind het maar normaal dat we iets terugdoen en met unicef delen we de kleuren blauw en wit en het publiek kinderen
4925836 we zijn toen 48 uur totaal van de kaart geweest
4925837 de mensen bleken hard geraakt door de beelden dat er zoveel kinderen in de wereld zwaar afzien is blijkbaar minder belangrijk dan het leed van een stripfiguur triest h in wat voor een wereld leven we toch
4925838 vijftien dagen voor mijn geboorte maakten de smurfen hun opwachting dat was in het tijdschrift robbedoes in een avontuur van johan en pirrewiet pas als adolescente besefte ik hoeveel geluk ik had om een papa te hebben die altijd thuis was en die zon mooi beroep uitoefende en zulke mooie verhalen verzon
4925839 de lezers van robbedoes smeekten om een album van de smurfen en toen het er was bleven ze maar meer en meer vragen het succes is te danken aan de kwaliteit van de scenarios en de persoonlijkheid van de smurfen ze zien er allemaal hetzelfde uit en toch zijn ze stuk voor stuk anders iedereen herkent zich wel in een smurf ook het aparte smurfentaaltje is een sleutel tot het succes voorts kun je de albums op twee manieren lezen er is het kinderverhaal papa heeft altijd kinderen voor ogen gehad politiek sigaretten en alcohol waren uit den boze volwassenen konden dan weer de knipogen herkennen denk maar aan smurfe koppen en koppige smurfen
4925840 en nu dertig jaar laten loop ik hier nog rond in 1984 richtte ik imps op imps doet alles de merchandising de productie van de albums de verdeling van de tv serie de dvds de muziek we zijn wereldwijd actief en stellen twintig mensen te werk aanvankelijk deed ik alleen met mijn papa de merchandising hij was een perfectionist en een van de eerste tekenaars die zijn contracten ook cht las en onderhandelde over de kleine puntjes de hele gilde heeft daar de vruchten van geplukt hij verzorgde zelf de tekeningen voor de ballonnen de t shirts het speelgoed hij bezocht zelfs de fabrieken waar die spullen gemaakt werden in die aanpak kroop enorm veel tijd
4925841 hij had een hekel aan cijfers maar verzorgde toch de zakelijke kant tot in de puntjes als ik niet wil gerold worden moet ik het zelf doen redeneerde hij maar gelukkiger werd hij er niet van in het begin kon hij johan en pirrewiet nog zelf tekenen terwijl hij voor de smurfen en steven sterk een beroep deed op medewerkers jongeren die het vak wilden leren meestal begonnen ze daarna met een eigen serie zoals walth ry met natasja en derib met yakari en buddy longway
4925842 met de productie van de animatiefilm de fluit met zes smurfen belvision 1975 hadden we vader al eens in rook zien opgaan in plaats van altijd thuis was hij plots altijd weg voor het storyboard alleen al maakt hij eigenhandig 1 232 tekeningen voor die amerikaanse tekenfilms stak hij voortdurend de oceaan over hij had altijd wel iets aan te merken
4925843 het succes heeft ons overweldigd het heeft de gezondheid van mijn vader onherstelbare schade toegebracht de commerci le belangen en de tv serie vraten al zijn tijd op op den duur kwam hij niet meer aan tekenen toe er verschenen geen nieuwe albums meer van johan en pirrewiet noch van de smurfen of steven sterk dat vond hij verschrikkelijk het werd zijn grote droom om opnieuw te gaan tekenen november 1992 verscheen er eindelijk weer een album de geldsmurf een maand later is hij gestorven finito kerstavond
4925844 tijdens het familiediner op zondag in ons huis in de boetendaellaan in ukkel heeft mijn moeder vaak genoeg geroepen stop met smurf te praten er bestaan nog andere zaken in de wereld het kantoor is nu gesloten maar de smurfen waren ons leven ik was een twintiger toen het succes zon hoge vlucht nam ik vond het geweldig als papa me s nachts wakker maakte omdat er een telex van de amerikanen was binnengelopen hij moest weten wat ze schreven hij was niet zo goed in engels
4925845 moeder stond in voor onze opvoeding maar als ik een slecht rapport had dan ging ik er liever mee naar mijn vader hij dacht niet dat hij god de vader was hij was trots op zijn crea tie maar het succes is hem nooit naar het hoofd gestegen hij bleef zich eenvoudig kleden behield zijn vrienden voelde zich nog het gemakkelijkst in zijn pantoffels hij regelde zelf onze vakanties we stapten met ons viertjes in de ford taunus links of rechts vroeg hij dan en we waren vertrokken zonder te weten waar naartoe heel europa hebben we zo gezien
4925846 you know not really write to public it anywhere only for myself
4925847 i know you well enough yknow youre a complete attention freak
4925848 yea chris you don need to go out hell you might attract more deaduns to us
4925849 como lo especifiqu en nuestra conferencia de prensa conjunta en tiflis estas medidas adicionales de seguridad s lo se pueden implementar en la proximidad inmediata a osetia del sur excluyendo cualquier otra parte del territorio georgiano
4925850 las tropas de pacificaci n rusas aplicar n medidas adicionales de seguridad hasta que comience a funcionar un mecanismo internacional de monitoreo
4925851 lo esencial es la retirada de las fuerzas rusas y eso a n no se produjo
4925852 los rusos tal vez no est n cumpliendo con su palabra
4925853 el mandato del contingente de paz ruso es muy limitado
4925854 estas fuerzas pueden proceder a patrullar limitadas en un rea determinada de la zona de conflicto y no deben dirigirse a las zonas urbanas georgianas o cortar la autopista
4925855 no queremos una din mica negativa en las relaciones de la otan con rusia pero para que eso ocurra rusia tiene que retirarse de georgia respetar la soberan a de georgia y su integridad territorial y jugar con las reglas del siglo xxi
4925856 the 2007 uspro criterium championship was our first really big win as a team last season despite a lot of other podiums it was also one of the first races where all of our guys took the front and dominated the race were hoping to return and defend it in the same aggressive manner we won it last year
4925857 we pulled off a major success against european national teams in the pyrenees last week won elk grove a number of podiums and top ten spots at the u23s and are coming back to downers with great momentum were looking forward to it
4925858 once im home im in i dont go back out
4925859 i cant say enough about how the team rode today
4925860 considering the competition and the fact that it was really just jonathan and ian left to do the work they managed to keep us right where we wanted to be
4925861 this group is not the same team that they were even a month ago
4925862 ian went in the early move which took a lot of pressure off us
4925863 and it wasnt an easy move to make since it had several top riders and they all went at a pretty tough section of rode
4925864 ian getting into the move really took the heat off us since garmin had to do the chasing
4925865 and then jonathan set a really good tempo over the climb
4925866 jonathan set a blistering pace up alpine loop which really whittled the field down separating the wheat from the chaff
4925867 he basically brought the break back on his own and then we railed it down the descent after which ian made sure to slip into another move honestly brent darren and i were able to sit and watch the others react to the efforts jonathan and ian made
4925868 coming into the final climb there is a short tough hill that danielson caldwell and sevilla attacked on this afternoon
4925869 this is where it was really helpful for us to know the course since we knew that this was way too early to attack and that we could catch them over the top so ian just pegged them and brought them back once we crested the little rise
4925870 it is the sort of climb that is so tough that you really are just going mano a mano
4925871 he is keenly aware of his strengths and when to pick his battles it was a master class of elegant racing
4925872 chadwick attacked at the bottom almost exactly the same place he attacked in 2006
4925873 at that point i knew i just had to go at my own tempo swindlehurst and baldwin kept attacking each other and i kept pegging them back i knew i couldnt play their game
4925874 i knew the climb and knew that at this altitude i couldnt go too deep too early
4925875 the top of the climb levels out to 5 or 6 which is much better for me and i also generally perform better the higher the altitude gets so i knew i should just go my tempo
4925876 at this altitude it is so easy for a rider to blow up
4925877 and jeff was able to pin caldwell back even after he had gained maybe 30 seconds on jeff that is really impressive
4925878 i didnt want to play around but rather just ride at my hardest maintainable effort
4925879 caldwell had spent a lot of energy so when i caught him there was around 800 meters left to climb and i knew the last 500 meters very well so i just went 100 and was able to gap caldwell off
4925880 no man your crazy theres to many of them we wont have a snow balls chance in hell of fighting our way thru
4925881 the city does not anticipate the need for widespread arrests
4925882 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
4925883 conservatives are not necessarily stupid but most stupid people are conservatives
4925884 the key task now is to transfer all refugees from temporary camps in north ossetia to stationary facilities we should also have to set up a humanitarian centre in tskhinvali to hand out aid to pay compensation for the lost property we need it so that people can live there in normal conditions so that they can be provided with food and medical help
4925885 they georgia are using smart weapon against small city when people in sleep its a barbaric attack russia patched its armed forces to response the annihilation of the south ossetia capital city tskhinavali they dared attacking south ossetia because of enormous forces support
4925886 im just coming here to win thats the aim for me
4925887 i thought there might be chinese fireworks or chinese food but its really lacking
4925888 it the chinese government has failed by acting in this way it has shown the world this is a country that does not respect human rights
4925889 ive had a wonderful trip this week i started off by having a chance to go to the olympic games opening ceremony and see a lot of those games which were fantastically managed
4925890 it was a surprise for me where was all the pollution i have read about in the newspapers
4925891 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4925892 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4925893 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4925894 were 100 percent sure it was dumped back on our doorstep
4925895 where it was found was not somewhere it could have gone by itself
4925896 este es mi inventario de cosas perdidas la revisi n de mi vida a mi ya no me sirve a ti si te lo dejo como regalo para que puedas hacer tu inventario a tiempo
4925897 i think he added to the levity of this group
4925898 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4925899 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4925900 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4925901 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4925902 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4925903 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4925904 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4925905 its a big day for china but we want to do more
4925906 we were playing at home and we just cannot lose this game
4925907 we win this game tonight because of our defense and the way yao played inside
4925908 its bigger than in 2004 because its really difficult having the home court and everything that comes with it
4925909 it makes me more excited it gives me more emotion
4925910 i think this team comes with more experience after all of our training games and a very frustrating game against spain
4925911 i think we all learn how to trust each other play together and win this game as a team
4925912 sometimes it seems like we are down like at halftime and in the fourth quarter but we know what to do
4925913 this is a big something how do i describe i dont know give me a break
4925914 tu puedes tener tu religi n y yo puedo tener la m a
4925915 si alguien cree que las religiones pueden convivir pac ficamente est so ando
4925916 its amazing how many club officials read fire brand of the american league
4925917 na fran a a pena de morte pode ser feita por decapita o
4925918 estava muito frio para mim preferia um clima um pouco mais quente mas ainda assim me senti bem para terminar a prova
4925919 era o que eu esperava talvez pudesse ter me sa do melhor mas me senti bem
4925920 o ocorrido contrariou nossa previs o cont vamos com outro clima que nos favoreceria mas n o foi assim
4925921 run and find the biggest crowd of people if he doesnt he will be killed
4925922 i have contacted sheriff bradshaw to assure him that i was not accusing his deputy of any misconduct in the royal palm beach shooting
4925923 i have not passed any judgment on the conduct of the deputy nor the young man involved
4925924 i was unaware that my previous and current use of the term
4925925 eu disse para mim mesma o que aconteceu porque elas n o est o vindo
4925926 fiquei olhando para tr s porque n o queria perder uma medalha mas n o acreditava no que estava vendo
4925927 com que frequ ncia voc pode dizer que viu a hist ria sendo feita
4925928 eu estava na alemanha quando mark spitz conquistou aquelas sete medalhas de ouro e adoraria que michael phelps ultrapasse o feito
4925929 vai phelps e hoff estamos orgulhosos de voc s campe es
4925930 isso me fez sentir muito nacionalista sentada em frente televis o
4925931 a economia e os pre os do combust vel est o sempre em sua mente mas o sucesso de michael ajuda voc a esquecer as coisas depressivas e lhe d alguma esperan a
4925932 mas realmente acredito que timo para essa garotada ter um bom modelo real em vez de toda aquela porcaria do hip hop que eles t m
4925933 cada um desses garotos quer ser um novo michael phelps
4925934 but beside that one way to do it is make it over dramatic such as
4925935 we hope that jessie can pass the miracle on we never knew how it would go we hoped it would be great and wed be back in aledo and that day has finally come and were so happy to be here
4925936 we do want to have a long term relationship with brett
4925937 he will always be a packer and hes very important to this organization
4925938 the more i rest the more i take care of my ankle and take care of myself then ill be closer to 100 percent if im not 100 then ill be 95 96
4925939 hes been out there two days and hes run some routes and done some individual work
4925940 thats pretty much what hes done its a step in the right direction
4925941 the instances of applicants securing jobs giving false information is not new but the situation has now reached new heights in the it sector which has forced the leading it firms like tcs satyam cognizant and others to take a tough stand
4925942 1234567890 or jus make it same as their ssid to make it easy to remember
4925943 in oklahoma if youre a junior they call you junior
4925944 and my mother would only agree to name me a junior if they called me something else
4925945 today ive lost not just a colleague but a good friend ive loved and respected
4925946 my heart goes out to the wise family for their loss of j b and i know the community will miss him a lot
4925947 its devastating i just think im numb i dont know what to say i cant believe its happened again
4925948 my prayers are with the family and teri he was such a neat person very knowledgeable very sincere always had a smile always had a laugh had that twinkle in his eye and hell be greatly missed
4925949 extremely intelligent extremely hard working extremely interested in what was best for bullhead city
4925950 and in the short period of time that he was on the council he had a tremendous impact on the council as a whole on the city its just a tremendous loss
4925951 we had the same sense of humor im aggrieved beyond belief i introduced him to bullhead city politics and i convinced him to run i met him when i was campaigning and we were instant friends
4925952 he is the most stand up person ive met in a long time a man of his word he has impeccable integrity i cant even imagine going on without him he was such a great guy to work with and to be involved with on the council i cant believe weve lost him
4925953 he is energetic hes smart he was one of the best things to happen to the city council in a long time hes honest hes open hes ethical theres nothing negative at all about j b
4925954 j b really helped me so much during my transition hes really going to be missed he had so much energy he was so good for our community he brought so much experience its going to be real tough without him
4925955 he was a tremendous asset to our council and he filled a void where a void needed to be filled and i relied on him and his expertise and his counsel im just going to miss him terribly absolutely terribly
4925956 the last couple days i have seen some big name athletes around the village and on the bus
4925957 in the second half belgium played poorly and we played better
4925958 it was 1 0 for us and would have been 2 0 it was definitely a goal but it was annulled why i dont know
4925959 then in the second half they scored a goal but it was a fault but was given
4925960 the first 25 minutes we showed enough quality to win it but i think two pieces of ill discipline cost us horribly
4925961 chucks argument was that some like murray who attempted to develop a
4925962 awareness which in the context this cunning and simultaneity becomes the act of a being which in its difference makes that difference an issue for it this folded characteristic being the very possibility of resistance
4925963 chucks argument was that some like murray who attempted to develop a
4925964 illegitimate children of the enlightenment anarchists and the french revolution 1880 1914
4925965 chucks argument was that some like murray who attempted to develop a
4925966 and above all things have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude of sins
4925967 let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins
4925968 embryos and fetuses spontaneously aborted most but not all of those canceled by god are luckless human souls
4925969 but a few spontaneous abortions occur in desired pregnancies with no discernable abnormalities for those girls and women and their families whose circumstances would make their babies luckless human souls i cancel them before they become babies
4925970 in this e mail exchange hillary clintons former ob gyn and abortionist william harrison admits that abortion kills a human soul
4925971 i was surprised he would admit this in the context of the new south dakota law but here he is acknowledging that abortionists cancel innocent human life
4925972 will terminate the life of a whole separate unique living human being
4925973 the bottom line is if the state legislature orders a professional to tell the truth thats not a violation of the first amendment
4925974 to provide a disclosure statement regarding services and means of handling complaints
4925975 the south dakota statement is very specific and no doubt is intended to discourage abortions
4925976 pro life advocates are united that abortion ends a life hence their opposition to abortion but what do pro choice doctors believe to get this perspective i consulted noted abortion doctor and friend of hillary clinton dr william harrison
4925977 i e mailed dr harrison regarding the south dakota law i asked him if the south dakota statement was accurate
4925978 anyone who has delivered as many babies as i have and has seen hundreds of living and dead embryos and fetuses being spontaneously aborted as have i knows exactly what we are doing when we provide an elective abortion for our patient we are ending the life of an embryo or a fetus not the life of a person but certainly a creature that might have become a person under other circumstances when i am asked this question i always go back to two of the most insightful and beautiful verses of the rubaiyat of omar khyyam
4925979 when omar wrote his beautiful and treasured poem over a thousand years ago mankind had no way of safely canceling from the scroll of universe one luckless human soul whose numbers make up that flood of howling anguish at least no way of canceling it without risking also the life of the woman carrying it in this day of medical marvels and hopefully ever increasing social justice we possess such a way
4925980 i am still reflecting on his response but i think he and i have different ideas of what preventing a life soul is for him it appears that prevention ranges from preventing conception to preventing a birth whereas i see the fetus as a human soul luckless or not
4925981 this new license allows us to attempt to make human pig clones to produce embryonic stem cells
4925982 we will take skin cells from patients who have a mutation for certain kinds of heart disease cardiomyopathy which makes the heart lose its pumping strength and put them into pig eggs after their chromosomes have been removed
4925983 ultimately they will help us to understand where some of the problems associated with these diseases arise and they could also provide models for the pharmaceutical industry to test new drugs we will effectively be creating and studying these diseases in a dish
4925984 but its important to say that were at the very early stages of this research and it will take a considerable amount of time there is still a great deal to learn about these techniques and much of our early work will involve understanding how we can make the hybrid cloning process as efficient as possible
4925985 the key thing we are doing is trying to create stem cells without any animal dna in them so even though these hybrid embryos normally have a small percentage of animal dna we are hoping to create cells that would have human chromosomes and human mitochondrial dna
4925986 mixing of these two diverse populations of mitochondria can be detrimental to cellular function
4925987 this application is a further indication of the interest in this sort of research by uk scientists the decision of the hfea to issue a license following stringent checks demonstrates that it is considered both necessary and ethical
4925988 while this approval comes under the existing 1990 human fertilisation and embryology act both houses of parliament have recently voted by large majorities to allow it into the future
4925989 it is good news that this license has been issued at a time when parliament has expressed overwhelming support for this research after an excellent public debate i suspect other similar applications will follow and hopefully this research can now progress without the hype
4925990 kita lihat saja nanti dengan naik penyidikan berarti kita sudah punya bukti permulaan

4925992 my goal was to come here and be olympic champion i did exactly that
4925993 i may have needed more races but i dont really have any excuses i just didnt make it
4925994 my hamstring feels good its not bothering me i wasnt too overwhelmed with it being the olympics
4925995 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the finish line
4925996 i could see him slowing down and i was still pumping to the finish line
4925997 these guys made it possible the relay made it possible its amazing to be a part of it
4925998 the whole thing every race one after the other from winning by one hundredth of a second to finishing it off with a world record its an amazing experience
4925999 its something ill have forever i literally wanted to do something that no ones ever done before in this sport without the help of my teammates it wouldnt have been possible
4926000 fastest growing sports in the world that no one has ever heard of
4926001 it is very simple someone says go and you go
4926002 we are mostly middle aged people in their 30s and 40s we race against teams that are 20 years younger and probably 20 pounds lighter
4926003 we beat them on a regular basis its all about going with the boat it is a very cool feeling when the boat goes
4926004 you will be able to bounce a nickel against your belly
4926005 in the next two weeks you are going to turn into an animal what kind of animal is up to you but its not going to be a bunny rabbit
4926006 if you are embarrassed by being called out in a crowd dont get in my boat
4926007 people get mad at me they call me names i dont care if they become better paddlers i have done my job its all in fun
4926008 he reminds me of my dad trying to teach me eighth grade algebra
4926009 if you dont think you are going to die during a race you arent paddling hard enough
4926010 it is not like baseball and volleyball and you miss the ball if you miss a stroke with your paddle the boat will still go
4926011 you gotta remember at the steel city dragons our charter is to get people in the boat it is not about making people crazy or scared
4926012 anytime you put 20 people in a little container and hand them a stick you sit back and see what happens
4926013 shes taught me lessons about myself and i feel like ive taught her
4926014 weve both changed and grown and we just feel like oh okay this is completion
4926015 if we continue to see these response times holding at this very high level the government will review the targets and whether they should be lifted further
4926016 theres no lying theres no cheating theres no nothing jennifer aniston is the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met
4926017 people are different people have different chemistry i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
4926018 i ended a relationship to be alone because i dont want to waste somebodys time if somethings not right
4926019 its just been a weird year i dont think anyone would expect it
4926020 i wouldnt wish it on any staff to go through
4926021 for him to come back and hopefully do this for us is going to be nice
4926022 he pitched great hopefully hell do it the rest of the season hopefully we can get him back next year and he can do it the whole year
4926023 without a doubt the last six weeks are huge for me not only prove to myself but to everybody else that im healthy and can still get guys out
4926024 matts game is command and getting ahead it wasnt there for him
4926025 whether nerves played a part i dont know but that was a rough night for the staff it makes it a little more difficult when your long man starts and we had to go get him early
4926026 i just hope everybody heals and can pitch if they have the opportunity
4926027 i feel like i just have better games against them i dont know why because theyre a tough team ill take it its always good to win here in oakland we havent done that over the last few years
4926028 it was a struggle to say the least i was one pitch away from every inning except for the sixth from having them blow the thing wide open id like it to be a little bit easier next time out
4926029 every time we come here you always think something is going to happen in a negative way and weve got to try to not think that way or say weve got to do this or that
4926030 its an ugly game but we won it i dont know how we did it
4926031 maybe every time everybody comes here get ready to be killed they made a couple of plays in the last couple of innings to make it interesting but our pitching staff and our bullpen did a tremendous job to hold those guys
4926032 we had the bases loaded with no outs and again with one out and we didnt score those are big situations and they are magnified when youre not scoring every run becomes crucial if we get one or two more runs wed get a few more wins
4926033 were trying to win every game so its the same intensity
4926034 greg didnt really have great command of the strike zone but to his credit he only gave up a couple of runs and kept us in the game
4926035 our problem is not in runs allowed but in scoring runs our pitching staff gives us a chance to win every time
4926036 i dont know how they did it but it was beautiful naigambo said of the marathon conditions
4926037 my foot has been sore for the past week kastor 35 told a reporter
4926038 i thought it was just tendons they get hyper sensitive leading up to a marathon i didnt expect to be finishing the marathon in a bus
4926039 i was hoping to pull them back said russell who was 27th in 2 33 13
4926040 we woule like to thank his majestys government for providing free electricity for this enterprise
4926041 so as an international flotilla of boats approachs the gaza cost of a humanitarion mission what will the israeli navy do
4926042 if at first you dont succeed you must not be
4926043 finally the transgender community will have somebody to look up to besides john travolta
4926044 i can bring something to this competition no other girl can bring two balls and a shaft
4926045 so pick me girls because ill be fierce on the runway
4926046 so much of it depends on how he feels today
4926047 we would love to have him back as soon as possible but until i get a report today on how he feels you dont get too excited one way or the other
4926048 matsui will be our dh and well probably put johnny somewhere in the outfield
4926049 you rotate your dh a little bit well worry about that when we get there weve still got to get him here
4926050 so my body my eyes are used to seeing pitching given the results that i had today im pretty satisfied
4926051 its wonderful that we have a really diverse crowd because when it comes to this issue of violence it affects all of us
4926052 we want to instill in children that there are ways of handling conflict other than acting out violently we want them to have a peaceful school year
4926053 we have learned from experience how to effectively interact with the community and how to service their needs
4926054 one message i like to get through to the young people is that we dont have to fight
4926055 my major goal at eastside is to reduce the number of students suspended for fighting
4926056 mixed in with all of the fun are some very important messages about violence prevention
4926057 when officers are doing red light enforcement they have to see both the red light and the vehicle running it which means having to do what run the red light themselves the white lights are visible from 360 degrees so the officer can sit downstream instead
4926058 as soon as we find a supplier for the newer version the led lights we hope to be able to distribute those to counties
4926059 designing multiple book clubs to meet the interest of diverse popuations
4926060 we hope that mr gambari would be able to revive the stalled dialogue
4926061 i wanted to be challenged and health care is ever changing my job is different every day and im constantly putting out fires but ive got to get out from behind my desk and get into the departments and understand what they do to understand the business i need to talk with people
4926062 i love coming to work everyday and that is because of the people its not just a job its a team of dedicated people working hard to do their best every day when you work in an environment where everyone strives for quality it makes you want to do the same and what better mission is there than to improve the quality of lives in your own community

4926085 bo diddley was a music pioneer and a legend with a unique style we always had a good time when we played together but his legacy will live on forever
4926086 listening to bo diddley you could convince yourself that the only thing you need to create great rock n roll is a tremolo guitar a killer beat and one and a half chords many tried and some have failed but nobody did it like diddley
4926087 bo diddleys voice and relentless glorious anthems echo down through my years this royal shape shifter continues to influence four generations of musicians on a daily basis
4926088 he was a wonderful original musician who was an enormous force in music and was a big influence on the rolling stones he was very generous to us in our early years and we learned a lot from him we will never see his likes again
4926089 its a good day because ive walked on the planet at the same time as bo diddley the simplistic and humorous artistry that accompanied this creation we all know as the bo diddley beat is a resounding testament to someone who knew how to touch us in a rock n roll way

4926091 even in a border free europe everyone wants a homeland
4926092 turn around and tell the democrats you guys dont respect us you dont want us around
4926093 and i learned a lot of new things that i can try in our national media marketing strategies meetings
4926094 is one that likes what they do how they do it and why they do it nothing is more important in the national media marketing industry than these things and i can speak for my company when i say that establishing these values in the office boosts results tremendously
4926095 weve noticed that over all performance and output has increased dramatically after implementing a solid corporate mission statement and list of commandments it has really helped these national media marketing workers focus their efforts and most importantly believe in what theyre doing
4926096 seven ways to increase productivity in the national media marketing business
4926097 if you tell someone in the national media marketing field that theyll get promoted sometime in the next year it is not nearly as helpful as saying youll get promoted in 6 months following outstanding performance reviews in your department
4926098 we have also found that holiday bonuses are very helpful
4926099 when the holidays arrive employees tend to get stressed out and tired easier this is of course attributed to holiday family gatherings purchasing gifts and a tighter family budget in general so by providing national media marketing workers with a bonus around the holidays the extra stress they feel melts away and gives rise to genuine gratitude and higher productivity levels
4926100 many times we get so caught up in the numbers we forget that our business functions on the sheer productivity of our employees
4926101 and when we stop and examine how things actually work on a day to day basis we can find ways of tweaking operation and creating a solid morale for our company
4926102 most national media marketing companies start with the bottom and work their way up when establishing new levels of corporate responsibility
4926103 and this permeates all the way to upper leadership and helps get rid of the dead wood
4926104 our national media marketing company had mediocre work ratings and efficiency but after we developed new ethics and values profits and production explded
4926105 i think the potential for success marketing in most all countries so why not casino games
4926106 i believe that online casinos can thrive in the east if they are marketed correctly that means outstanding customer service a realistic gaming experience and good deposit options
4926107 theyre piling on because im winning im very much at home in the kitchen

4926168 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by any party affiliation
4926169 i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
4926170 like many im astounded at barack obamas meteoric rise as a candidate but i have no doubt that his is the leadership we need and that the world is crying out for
4926171 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4926172 basdically from my perspective this is simply not a time for politics as usual
4926173 the portfolio of issues that are going to be passed on to the next president will be as daunting as any since the great depression and world war ii and that means that the case for inspiring new political leadership and a social ethic has seldom been more self evident
4926174 it seems to me that there are some big shifts going on in this state
4926175 the people of iowa are saying that they want to give the democrats a chance
4926176 i can tell you senator obama is not taking this state for granted
4926177 were going to have to work for it and we intend to do so and we intend to earn every vote
4926178 by the time the glass steagall act was repealed in 1999 the 300 million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework the regulatory environment failed to keep pace when subprime mortgage lending took a reckless and unsustainable turn a patchwork of regulators were unable or unwilling to protect the american people
4926179 i wouldnt trade one stupid decision for another five years of life
4926180 i believe senator obama is the best candidate to restore american credibility to restore our confidence to be moral and to bring people together to solve the complex issues such as the economy the environment and global stability
4926181 my goal is to let republicans have a clear understanding that their right to vote should not be restricted by any party affiliation
4926182 do we really want another klutz in the white house
4926183 its more like a part of canada where they speak french which we all know is the language of elitists what obama should have done was get the mayor of myrtle beach to endorse him not the mayor from some exotic place like fairbanks
4926184 i cant help but thinking we played a role in this

4926196 in my view the auto is sacrosanct i will fight tooth and nab to make sure that it is not unsealed up
4926197 the auto is the exclusive endorsement river has from individual more politically coercive downstream states

4926224 we need to find more consistency as a team tampa bay is in first place and its nice to take a win out of their category

4926306 but he will remain throughout the run of the series an executive producer and he will whenever cbs asks come back i dont think youve seen the last of gil grissom
4926307 im in a great place in terms of knowing that ill be more free to make choices and im responsible enough to not do it in a way that would hurt the show
4926308 i want it to work for the writers i want it to work for the cast and most importantly i want it to work for the audience
4926309 this will be a year of transition for the show
4926310 we always knew it was coming and im glad it didnt come until now

4926320 the hard part will be saying goodbye to the cast and crew so im going to stay as involved as im allowed to be throughout the remainder of this show until they turn off all the lights

4926448 this is no time for lightness you have to get sober minded about spiritual matters it is an issue of life and death
4926449 there was war in heaven michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him
4926450 there appeared a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars and she being with child cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered
4926451 and there appeared another wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his heads and his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven and did cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born
4926452 her child was caught up unto god and to his throne
4926453 when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child
4926454 and the dragon was wroth with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seed which keep the commandments of god and have the testimony of jesus christ
4926455 im sixty five years old and the people in my congregation know me as man of prayer but now out of nowhere evil thoughts have begun to plague me a lust has come upon me that i have never experienced in my life

4926458 youre a failure as a parent you cant do anything right and you dont know god intimately youre a phony a hypocrite you arent what people think you are you are a poor example of what a christian mate ought to be
4926459 the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman that she might be swallowed up which the dragon cast out of his mouth
4926460 fear the name of the lord the enemy shall come in like a flood
4926461 i know what god said but im going to act according to my own will
4926462 a stubborn and rebellious generation a generation that set not their heart aright and whose spirit was not steadfast with god
4926463 ye would not go up but rebelled against the commandment of the lord your god

4926471 if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses
4926472 you may be obedient in every other area in your life pious devout and faithful but if you hold onto unforgiveness toward anyone then your own sins are piling up against you unforgiven by the father
4926473 if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts glory not and lie not against the truth this wisdom descendeth not from above but is earthly sensual devilish for where envying and strife is there is confusion and every evil work
4926474 who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you

4926484 but we remain optimistic that the legislation will pass this year i dont want to predict when it will get done but ive seen a lot of things get done between the elections and the end of the year
4926485 every emerging technology has had support from the federal government at some point along the way
4926486 this is no different and the fact is the societal benefits of renewable energy not just solar are so important and it makes business sense in balancing our system as a company were not just supporting renewable for the sake of supporting renewables its important to have a balanced energy portfolio that includes nuclear as well as the use of clean fossil fuels renewables make business sense

4926630 a key to achieving this goal with our ads is providing relevant choices and giving users the opportunity to determine which ads they find most relevant
4926631 i want to make it clear that this is a revision that only affects keyword bidding advertisers and agencies are accustomed to the fact that users typing in their trademarked term as part of a two three or four word search will have always resulted in competitor ads running for example someone typing in x y z credit cards in the search box will see lots of different relevant credit card ads because broad matching will bring up ads for those advertisers bidding against the keywords credit card so we hope this will be a familiar step for agencies and advertisers however despite this trademarked keyword change our strict ads text policy remains unchanged unauthorised advertisers will not be able to use a monitored trademarked term in their ad text so ads of trademark owners are still likely to have the edge over those of non trademark owners because these ads can use the trademark terms in the ad text they are likely to have higher click through rates and therefore more likely to achieve a better position in the sponsored links this change brings the uk and ireland into line with the us and canada which has been running this policy since 2004 a good proportion of users in the us and canada have been clicking on competitor ads even when searching against trademarked terms suggesting that they find the greater number of ads relevant and helpful when researching or making a purchase

4926641 everything was accomplished doing all best times winning every race everything that we wanted to do here has been accomplished
4926642 ive dreamt a lot of things written down a lot of goals and this was the biggest dream i have ever written down
4926643 this is a dream come true you can imagine anything to work towards it through all the ups and downs to accomplish everything you ever dreamed of its fun it feels pretty good
4926644 i heard about the announcement at yankees stadium that if people are out to eat the television is on and swimming is on thats good but this work is in progress and it is going to take some time to achieve
4926645 i dont want this sport to be an every four year sport
4926646 we get the most attention every four years but in between there is not as much exposure for us as i would like
4926647 we swim each day of the year and there is no off season in swimming the only off season is after every olympics
4926648 i want to get people involved in the sport and to be aware of what were doing
4926649 in the upcoming years we will see it more and more i really think it is going to happen
4926650 i hope they will have it easier than we did swimming has changed my life and allowed me to do so many things i cant imagine what it is going to be like in say 10 years im excited to watch it change
4926651 over the next four years i would like to try some other events events i havent tried yet events i havent done here and they we will see what happens
4926652 bob coach bowman said he wants to start fresh and try new things we havent done before try new training methods its going to be a fun four years

4926663 he consulted with a number of physicians in an effort to correct the problem without surgery but it was ultimately determined that surgery was the best path to take for his general well being and for his career
4926664 the doctors tell us he will be able to play pain free when he returns to the lineup this season

4926669 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4926670 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4926671 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4926672 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4926673 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4926674 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4926675 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4926677 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4926678 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4926679 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4926680 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4926681 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration

4926706 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4926707 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4926708 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4926709 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4926710 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4926711 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4926712 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4926713 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4926714 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4926715 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4926716 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4926717 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4926718 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4926719 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4926720 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4926721 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4926722 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4926723 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military

4926743 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4926744 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4926745 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4926746 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4926747 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4926748 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4926749 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4926750 after world leaders agreed to halve hunger by 2015 the number of hungry people in the world rose from 854 million to 954 million
4926751 the government has an obligation to address the issue of hunger and it should create the environment while actionaid international wants people to know the causes of global hunger
4926752 the large tenders are international and the value of each project is not divulged
4926753 theres a fiscal agreement between the mcc and the mozambican government to guarantee that the funds dont pay any tax
4926754 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4926755 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4926756 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4926757 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4926758 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4926759 dave wannstedt is the right guy for the right job at absolutely the right time pitt is on the cusp of becoming a perennial top 10 team all the needed state of the art facilities are in place and dave is the element that will take the program to another level
4926760 i think it is very clear this program is on the rise and dave has it headed in the right direction
4926761 i am very happy the administration stuck by him and has shown some patience because more often than not that isnt the case coaches who come in usually have a mess to clean up and by the time they are done straightening it out theyve had a few losing seasons and they are fired
4926762 but if you look at this situation dave has recruited extremely well hes built a great base of talent that talent is starting to mature and more importantly he is bringing in the right kinds of players kids that work hard are good students and dont embarrass the university this thing is being built for the long haul
4926763 look at how many guys with much bigger names than me guys like mike ditka dan marino tony dorsett that they could have chosen to do this and they asked me so there was no way i could pass up this opportunity
4926764 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4926765 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4926766 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4926767 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4926768 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4926769 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4926770 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4926771 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4926772 the recognition is nice but it doesnt change the focus or hunger this football team has
4926773 no bowl or championship is won in august our players understand that and they know the next step in making our goals a reality is finishing up training camp strong and then getting ready for bowling green
4926774 to have people believing we have one of the best teams in the nation going into this thing its exciting for us
4926775 i dont think anything is guaranteed but we certainly have put ourselves in position where at least the college football world thinks were pretty good
4926776 i think it motivates the guys to prepare well but the big thing is if you think about a championship way back in january that can wear you down
4926777 its our responsibility as coaches to help these guys break it down to one day at a time one workout at a time one practice at a time just prepare to be in position for the challenge
4926778 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4926779 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4926780 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4926781 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected

4926787 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4926788 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources

4926820 and i been running all my life and not a day not a day too soon
4926821 i dont know really im pretty blank still and im feeling quite tired and sort of an anti climax this morning im sure tonight it will all sink in when the medal ceremony happens
4926822 how simple can it be they have the ability to do that sometimes and they sort of grab on to you they tried to manhandle me which is probably not a good idea
4926823 she tried but eventually i was able to get the flag and to run over of my own free will and give kirsten a hug which was awesome
4926824 i got home about 1 30 1 45 and there was a whole bunch of kiwis outside our whanau house to have a toast of champagne pop a few bubbles was pretty awesome just to share that moment knowing it was so late and they were still waiting up for me was pretty special
4926825 i still feel like someone is going to tap me on the shoulder and tell me it was big dream
4926826 for us it wasnt about getting a medal yesterday it was about rowing well
4926827 when we crossed the finish line it was a relief that the physical side of the race was over and i know i was just stoked to have gone out there and raced as hard as i could and as technically well as i could
4926828 weve slowly been getting our confidence back but it wasnt till the heats last week i really felt we were competitive thats all we wanted to be we knew if were competitive we had a shot at getting a medal
4926829 its been a pretty rocky road for me this week
4926830 obviously its had its ups and downs overall theres little bit of disappointment but certainly no regret i put everything out there but wasnt good enough
4926831 no its the olympics if you get ill youve got to deal with it i still felt i was capable of winning that race and probably if it was 1900m long i would have won it but its 2k race

4926857 many legitimate patients following the direction of the doctor have run into trouble with methadone including death
4926858 methadone is an extremely difficult drug to use even for specialists people were using it rather blithely for several years
4926859 in the clinical and regulatory communities everyone is trying to run and catch up with and deal with the causes of methadone overdoses
4926860 this could unequivocally cause death in patients who have not recently been using narcotics
4926861 we would have no reason to suspect that the dosing regimen

4926896 nosotros no decimos c mo debe ser el abastecimiento lo que es efectivo es que los resultados permiten prever que podemos dejar de construir algunas centrales porque lo que aportan las fuentes no convencionales es significativo
4926897 que siempre ha sido vista como soluci n de emergencia pero despu s de este estudio pasa a ser una fuente de energ a m s que hay que considerar
4926898 esto podr a ocurrir si se generen pol ticas p blicas que permitan superar los obst culos que han impedido trabajar en fuentes de energ a alternativas y en eficiencia energ tica las autoridades han tenido pereza mental para buscar soluciones pretendiendo que sea el mercado quien arregle todo
4926899 los supermercados deben mejorar sus sistemas de iluminaci n y refrigeraci n e incorporar equipos nuevos no decimos que hay que botarlos de un d a para otro pero a medida que crezcan econ micamente deben agregar tecnolog a m s eficiente

4926901 s lo la geot rmica como en todas partes del mundo requiere una ayuda estatal en las primeras exploraciones

4926915 estamos aqu en la uac levantando nuestra voz el arma m s poderosa que tenemos
4926916 la mina alumbrera consume el 50 del agua que consume la provincia pero adem s consume el 78 de la energ a de catamarca lo interesante es que los problemas de agua y energ a pasan a ser de la comunidad los medios lo instalan as no consuma luz o agua
4926917 modelo de saqueo que se basa en la destrucci n de los medios de vida
4926918 tenemos que luchar por instalar los bienes comunes como palabra y le ponemos el cuerpo a todo esto sin perder de vista el problema del modelo sabiendo que la alumbrera es un punto m s dentro de este modelo de desarrollo de explotaci n y saqueo
4926919 como asamblea esto es un desaf o ya se hicieron acciones hacia la comunidad como para producir un impacto de que se est diciendo algo porque hay que decir ya que si algo qued muy fuerte ac es la marcha del silencio pero en catamarca necesitamos volver a decir
4926920 entender que somos un pa s colonial cuesta en esta poca en que aqu no son necesarios los soldados porque ya formaron los universitarios los profesionales los pol ticos para manejar esto el rol colonizado de la universidad corre paralelo con la colonizaci n de la secretar a de agricultura y del senasa que aprueban lo que las corporaciones necesitan el inta que trabaja para las empresas abiertamente mediante el impulso de polos biotecnol gicos que trabajan para implantar el modelo de nidera cargill monsanto y bunge la miner a los eucaliptos la soja el engorde a corral los grandes criaderos de aves esto es parte de una escala macro en la que operan las empresas pero este fen meno que nos parec a tan lejano el que se pueda vincular en la sociedad todos estos modelos se ha dado con una materialidad sorprendente gracias al gran desarrollo de la conciencia ambiental
4926921 cada vez que nosotros nos movemos y damos un paso vemos c mo se expresa el iirsa integraci n de la infraestructura regional suramericana y as se entiende por qu el tratado binacional que entrega la cordillera de los andes fue orquestado casi diez a os antes de que lo firmara carlos menem vemos c mo se fue desarrollando y pensando el saqueo la hidrov a hecha para que los barcos de gran porte se lleven todo tambi n fue pensada hace mucho tiempo porque saben que la mejor manera de llevarse los bienes comunes es la l nea recta poco costo y rapidez y ah tambi n est gioja que ha regalado todo para que el paso de aguas negras salga hacia el pac fico con un corredor bioc anico y para todo esto es necesario tambi n energ a y r pida para eso las centrales nucleares cuatro centrales que impulsa kirchner y no hablemos de la cantidad de compa eros confundid simos que toman como bandera la energ a nuclear porque es una tecnolog a de punta o porque estamos en crisis energ tica c mo no vamos a estar en crisis una sola empresa minera consume el 10 de la energ a del pa s qu pasar cuando empiecen a funcionar agua rica y pascua lama cu nta energ a se necesitar y ah entra el cuento de la crisis energ tica por eso para luchar y estar seguros de c mo afrontar los debates tenemos que saber y conocer
4926922 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
4926923 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
4926924 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca
4926925 indagar qu es lo que contamina en el rea en donde existe la asamblea o el grupo
4926926 trascender el aspecto puntual para llegar a los problemas de fondo
4926927 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
4926928 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
4926929 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
4926930 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
4926931 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen
4926932 los ciudadanos del territorio argentino decimos no a la miner a qu mica con la modalidad a
4926933 esperamos que las autoridades de gobierno se abstengan de seguir interviniendo a favor del citado proyecto para que pueda ser evaluado correctamente

4926936 we now have the ability with sequence to show an entire context and the simultaneity of a particular event
4926937 we just need to keep working on that and realize that weve won a preseason game its good in some ways but in others it doesnt mean anything
4926938 it was really nice to see him move the ball in the middle of the field and run with it
4926939 i thought chad did a nice job of managing the game all around
4926940 we didnt move the ball we got totally stuffed offensively defensively we never slowed them down special teams never won the field position it was an ugly half to be honest
4926941 were not going to make every play but there were plays we left out on the field
4926942 when i have mike walker running down pretty much wide open i know he kind of got jammed at the line but i still have to make that a catchable ball for him you dont want to miss your layups
4926943 he came in last week and picked up the playbook in two days maybe he became a leader on offense in the first day
4926944 im going out there to try to play quarterback as well as i can and let it go from there
4926945 we want to make a good decision and we will
4926946 im confident ill say it again i like all three of them i thought tonight all three of them did a nice job
4926947 as an offense you need to make some plays to get into a rhythm and to get a tempo going
4926948 tonight our tempo stunk i didnt make any plays so i take that squarely on my shoulders a lot of times a quarterback if hes making plays can get the offense going and i didnt make any plays
4926949 its our job as an offense to go out there and score touchdowns
4926950 tonight we moved the ball consistently and we want to keep putting the ball into the end zone
4926951 u s a u s a lets go phelps u s a u s a
4926952 i got behind 0 2 in a period of 15 seconds and i was like oh no not this again
4926953 i dont care who ended it we needed to win this game
4926954 it would have been a rough one for us to lose we had so many opportunities at this point it doesnt make a difference how it looks we need to get wins
4926955 its not like youre down one run there isnt really any pressure on you
4926956 if you get a hit great everybody loves it if not well thats what weve been doing for the last eight innings anyway so we go back out and play defense in the 14th
4926957 the bullpen just came in and shut the door everybody threw the ball great
4926958 this event shows the pipes work and that if you put on great programming that people want to watch then theyll show up
4926959 everyone of us who has visited here comes away with a deep admiration for the chinese people so much to admire here and so much to learn
4926960 im happy with the way this first game this first chance to play went
4926961 i felt like i played average at best but its a start and you have to start somewhere
4926962 i will take a few 4 yard carries like i had tonight
4926963 i ran with some toughness ive had to stay patient through the whole process and im still trying to make all the effort over the last year pay off
4926964 there are always some things we can clean up but it was one of those nights where everything clicked
4926965 you can say its the preseason and its going to be ok but i thought defensively we were poor
4926966 weve got to do a better job starting with the coaches myself and the people on that side of the ball
4926967 were jamming the work in not just for the nascar trucks bringing in cars but also for the fans
4926968 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
4926969 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion
4926970 we dont really want to give any info on how we use it as an investigative tool to help the bad guys
4926971 it is an investigative tool for us and it is a very new investigative tool
4926972 ive seen them in cases from new york city to small towns whoever can afford to get the equipment and plant it on a car
4926973 and of course its easy to do you can sneak up on a car and plant it at any time
4926974 but i dont think thats something detectives would be too happy to put out there like that
4926975 they do have different techniques they like to use on suspects but they dont really want people to know
4926976 a police officer could do the same thing with his or her own eyes
4926977 it helps to cut down on the number of police officers who would have to be out tracking particular cars
4926978 while it may be true that police can conduct surveillance of people on a public street without violating their rights tracking a person everywhere they go and keeping a computer record of it for days and days without that person knowing is a completely different type of intrusion
4926979 things that would have seemed fantastic 15 years ago are now routine
4926980 we have to rethink what is a reasonable expectation of privacy
4926981 the issue is whether the more sophisticated tools are doing the same things we used to do or are creating a different set of legal circumstances

4926998 all the money that has been provided by new zealand would better to go into infrastructure to keep people here the forum is not going to persuade people to stay
4926999 the fact that we are holding the forum and we are able to cope might be contrary to what he thought was going to happen

4927001 people who have experienced migraines know just how debilitating these can be and people respond differently to different treatments
4927002 what we have seen is that topamax can cut back the recurrence of migraines by about 45 percent on average

4927220 who would have thought that the apa whose code of ethics mandates a respect for basic principles of human rights and holds psychologists to a higher standard of conduct than is required by the law would be so reluctant to prohibit psychologists from participating in interrogations from guant namo to abu ghraib
4927221 the apa has justified this policy of engagement by stating its involvement is intended to stop unethical interrogations
4927222 no psychologist apa member or not should be directly or indirectly involved in any form of detention or interrogation that could lead to psychological or physical harm to a detainee doing so would be a clear violation of the professions ethical standards

4927230 it was just sheer pandemonium it seemed that every gun on the ship was firing at once and the noise was terrific i dont know how long it went on for it just seemed endless never before did i see such incessant action that was the apex of my operational carreer and the most horrible experience of my life
4927231 some of our pilots were good but i really saw some fine flying by the germans that day sometimes they came in really close actually firing as they rolled even firing while upside down you could see the cannons firing like little red blinker systems going as we got deeper into germany they seemed even more desperate i did the full operational tour of 25 missions but i never saw more determined fighter attacks this was the only time that i ever swore cursed and prayed at the same time
4927232 i witnessed something that mankind will never see again it was rare to see hundreds and hundreds of aircraft in the sky at one time it looked like a parachute invasion of germany there were planes in flat spins planes in big wide spins planes were going down so often that it became useless to try to report them my god i had never seen anything like that before even hollywood could never match that it is still a very vivid scene to me

4927255 quem acredita em que os duendes provocam a chuva v uma prova da exist ncia dos duendes a cada vez que chove

4927264 e por que foi preciso enviar uma tropa de romanos para prender jesus se ele era um pac fico profeta rezando com alguns seguidores
4927265 quando jesus ficou sozinho os que estavam com ele junto com os doze perguntaram o que significavam as par bolas
4927266 para voc s foi dado o mist rio do reino de deus para os que est o fora tudo acontece em par bolas para que olhem mas n o vejam escutem mas n o compreendam para que n o se convertam e n o sejam perdoados
4927267 porque deus amou ao mundo de tal maneira que deu o seu filho unigenito para que todo que cre nao pere a mastenha a vida eterna

4927284 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4927285 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4927286 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4927287 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4927288 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4927289 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4927290 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4927291 weve been close before i dont know if we would have been able to get by tony or not he was pretty quick
4927292 the car was awesome all day there were a couple of cars that were real fast tony and brian vickers but my pit crew just did a great job there at the end i dont know what kind of problem tony had on pit road but it was sure a lot easier to pass him there than it would have been on the racetrack
4927293 weve certainly had more than our share of good finishes here and it seems like its a track where we always race well
4927294 you dont want to come across greedy but im getting sick and tired of not winning one of these races
4927295 we feel like every race weve been in weve led but we havent led the right lap
4927296 i really feel like it was the power difference between the ford and the toyotas with the new restrictor plate carl just got too far out ahead of us at the end and we didnt have enough time
4927297 i never thought it would be such a big deal but it has been its not like ill never these guys again but i know this is the last time im going to work with this particular group of guys
4927298 he that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else
4927299 den kamu kenapa kok dari kemarin wajahmu nggak enak di lihat
4927300 aku juga nggak tau maksudnya gimana tapi dokter itu bilang aku masih keturunan ningrat apa perlu aku membuktikannya dengan mengiris jariku ya
4927301 its like this at every olympics because of corporate sponsors we have the tickets wish i had more
4927302 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4927303 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis
4927304 is deliberately misrepresenting the facts about our plan in order to shift attention away from the democrats shameful record
4927305 her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
4927306 i looked up and i saw kobe and lebron the best basketball players in the world no way we were going to let those guys down
4927307 he did something thats never been done before were happy to be a part of it
4927308 every single athlete in the world right now needs to tip their hat to michael phelps
4927309 it wouldnt have been possible without the help of my teammates
4927310 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4927311 everything had to go perfect everything had to fall perfectly into place and i was able to have probably the best week of my life
4927312 even without the dogfighting case michael had been the victim of some very flawed advice by a number of professionals who were supposed to know what they were doing and were supposed to be helping him
4927313 there are some things you cant share without ending up liking each other
4927314 if the atoms never swerve so as to originate some new movement that will snap the bonds of fate the everlasting sequence of cause and effect what is the source of the free will possessed by living things throughout the earth
4927315 im still amazed that we can actually manage to prove that
4927316 its kind of depressing when people cant communicate with each other
4927317 we know thats true in politics but youd think that wouldnt be going on here
4927318 the last time we had this level of socialism being proposed and inexperience at the helm was jimmy carter
4927319 well hes promoting what i would term a government takeover of the health system
4927320 he has said he wants to mandate free college tuition for every student in america
4927321 unlike ted kennedy he meant jack kennedy of course who said dont ask what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country he obama says were the wealthiest country in the world you should get this you should get that youre entitled to this youre entitled to that to me thats a move toward socialism
4927322 im familiar with what his work was here at the state capitol and to me the best indicator of future behavior is past behavior
4927323 and he has supported what i would consider to be socialistic moves on health care as a state senator
4927324 the last time we had this level of socialism being proposed and inexperience at the august 16 2008
4927325 getting from the north to the south of the site used to be slow and painstaking but the bridge will make it a delight
4927326 there can be no liberty for a community which lacks the information by which to detect lies
4927327 history is not separated from the present we are always simultaneously part of the past in the present and anticipating the future in other words the past operates on us now in the present and affects our conception of what is yet to come at the same time our present notions of reality affect how we view the past
4927328 by a kind of perverted logic colonialism turns to the past of the oppressed people and distorts disfigures and destroys it
4927329 evangelista said it was bad that it would continue to perpetrate the notion that we were somehow lost before magellan came and needed to be found to start our history philippine historiography has to a great extent already gone past that many history professors now treating magellans coming as just one of many external interventions in this country indeed evangelista says many history professors go as far back 250 000 years bc to tell the story of this country it wasnt a story that began only in 1521 its time we stopped thinking it did
4927330 we need only to see that we were not the savages that had to be delivered spiritually and physically to the light we need only to see that the process by which we became westernized was not a simple one of pouring things into an empty receptacle but a complex one of mixing many things
4927331 but whats the big deal about identity well look at countries like thailand singapore and malaysia and look at us with nations as with individuals you have no sense of self you will never know and do what you want you will only know and follow what others tell you to
4927332 certain kinds of transgression against authority constitute normal behavior for those in the social periphery the kinds of behavior sociologists call
4927333 how much more important are patterns of personal and economic relationships than are the vague abstractions usually invoked in explaining the deteriorating position of jews in late fifteenth century italy
4927334 factional conflict did not rest on a patronage system but on local solidarity and that economic activity was defined by many forces that were external to the operations of the market
4927335 exemplifies how inadequate are institutional studies that rely simply on the elites self descriptions of political behaviour and economic studies in which global statistics obscure the actual nature of exchanges
4927336 other things being equal the interpretation requiring the fewest hypotheses should generally be taken as the most probable
4927337 the purpose of microhistory is to elucidate historical causation on the level of small groups where most of real life takes place and to open history to peoples who would be left out by other methods

4927585 well look at the report when we receive it and well take our decisions in a sensible way
4927586 the implications for the budget long term are serious were doing it in a responsible way and we dont make any apologies for that either
4927587 i think it is important that we have an adequate pension system because decisions in this area do cost an enormous amount of money
4927588 and whatever we do has to be affordable but also in the long run it has to be sustainable
4927589 this government has had eight months already to do something about pensions
4927590 they could have funded a 30 a week increase to the single pension in this years budget by foregoing tax cuts for people earning more than 75 000 a year
4927591 our position over the long term is for a 100 a week increase to provide pensioners with a decent quality of life
4927592 we are hopeful of providing private fishers family with some long awaited answers
4927593 vietnam veterans say that it is really important that we dont have the same sort of mistakes that were made with us with this newer generation
4927594 one of the things that we are dealing with now is people who have come back from two or three different conflicts
4927595 that produces a whole range of questions about multiple deployments and what sorts of impacts they actually have on the people we send over
4927596 over the coming five to 10 years a lot more

4927647 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4927648 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4927649 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain

4927673 gigantisch unglaublich sie hat so eine lockerheit bekommen das ist gro artig
4927674 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4927675 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4927676 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4927677 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4927678 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4927679 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4927680 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4927681 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4927682 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4927683 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4927684 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

4927710 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4927711 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4927712 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4927713 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4927714 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4927715 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4927716 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4927717 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4927718 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4927719 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4927720 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4927721 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4927722 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4927723 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4927724 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4927725 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4927726 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4927727 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4927728 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4927729 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4927730 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4927731 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4927732 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4927733 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4927734 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4927735 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4927736 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4927737 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4927738 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4927739 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4927740 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4927741 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4927742 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4927743 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4927744 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4927745 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4927746 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4927747 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4927748 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4927749 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4927750 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4927751 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4927752 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4927753 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4927754 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4927755 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4927756 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4927757 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4927758 who are open to doing something on the production side
4927759 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4927760 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4927761 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4927762 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4927763 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill

4927859 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4927860 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4927861 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4927862 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

4927898 when the internet first emerged it assumed devices would be fixed in place and linked by wires
4927899 but thats no longer true a large number of devices are mobile and equipped with wireless communication capabilities
4927900 were not looking to replace the internet with the flick of a switch
4927901 what were proposing is a robust flexible optimised and above all user friendly set of technologies and standards that will mean any user anywhere can identify and network with any nearby devices without any technical expertise whatsoever
4927902 that works fine in wired networks but what happens if the user moves their address has changed not the identity
4927903 but if separate values are used for identity and routing then this isnt a problem even if the user is walking through a park weve successfully separated the two functions
4927904 it does address the basis of networking but it can happily plug into the internet itself that said if everybody or even the majority is using wip to create internets then wip is the internet

4928037 ces trois cliniques ont fait lobjet de publications aupr s du us national institutes of health
4928038 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4928039 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4928040 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4928041 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4928042 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
4928043 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4928044 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4928045 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4928046 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4928047 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4928048 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4928049 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4928050 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4928051 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4928052 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down

4928134 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4928135 this is a planning took where all things are going
4928136 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4928137 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4928138 theres so much emotions going through my head and so much excitement i kind of just want to see my mom
4928139 with so many people saying it couldnt be done all it takes is an imagination and thats something i learned and something that helped me
4928140 i was able to be a part of three relays and we were able to put up a solid team effort and we came together as one unit
4928141 for the three olympics ive been a part of this is by far the closest mens team that weve ever had i didnt know everybody coming into this olympics but i feel going out i know every single person very well the team that we had is the difference
4928142 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4928143 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4928144 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances

4928162 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4928163 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4928164 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4928165 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4928166 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4928167 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4928168 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4928169 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4928170 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4928171 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4928172 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4928173 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4928174 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4928175 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4928176 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4928177 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4928178 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4928179 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4928180 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4928181 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4928182 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4928183 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4928184 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4928185 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4928186 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4928187 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4928188 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4928189 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4928190 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4928191 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4928192 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4928193 we had received leads into the case on the basis of five mobile phones used by the conspirators of the blasts
4928194 during our investigations we found five mobile phones with sim cards which enabled only incoming calls were being used prior to the blasts
4928195 interestingly the phone became inactive in the evening of july 26 the day the blasts took place
4928196 una potencia regional que se est consolidando como una potencia mundial

4928198 deben ser discutidos por el pueblo venezolano y que lo que nosotros podamos hacer para ayudar siempre respetando siempre la soberan a de ese pa s vecino lo haremos

4928254 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4928255 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4928256 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4928257 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools

4928270 i expected less i didnt think they could build something like this
4928271 its unbelievable amazing and definitely worth the money they spent its mind blowing i dont see how theres a stadium anywhere thats better than this one
4928272 i love it all everything you walk in and you cant even describe what it looks like its just breathtaking
4928273 i wanted the kids to get a chance to see the stadium
4928274 its pretty nice im impressed theres more leg room the seats are wider padded better
4928275 i wanted to come down and see what the big deal was all about it was well worth all the anticipation
4928276 it was fun to lie down on but i wouldnt want a 300 pound lineman jumping on me and shoving me into it thats for sure

4928298 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4928299 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4928300 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4928301 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4928302 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4928303 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4928304 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4928305 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4928306 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4928307 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4928308 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4928309 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4928310 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4928311 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4928312 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4928313 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4928314 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4928315 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4928316 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4928317 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4928318 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4928319 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4928320 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4928321 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4928322 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4928323 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4928324 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4928325 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4928326 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4928327 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4928328 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4928329 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4928330 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4928331 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4928332 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4928333 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4928334 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4928335 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4928336 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4928337 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4928338 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4928339 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4928340 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional

4928361 there have been complications in the pregnancy so she has been with us for some time so we could ensure everything would be all right
4928362 in life there are many hundreds of common experiences feelings situations and even objects which we all know and recognize but for which no words exist on the other hand the world is littered with thousands of spare worlds which spend their time doing nothing but loafing about on signposts pointing at places our job as we see it is to get these words down off the signposts and into the mouths of babes and sucklings and so on where they can start earning their keep in everyday conversation and make a more positive contribution to society douglas adams john lloyd and indeed in liff

4928366 they accused the paper of biased coverage of race relations
4928367 i think that after losing yesterday to germany the damage was done
4928368 in the second half belgium played poorly and we played better
4928369 it was 1 0 for us and would have been 2 0 it was definitely a goal but it was annulled why i dont know
4928370 then in the second half they scored a goal but it was a fault but was given
4928371 the first 25 minutes we showed enough quality to win it but i think two pieces of ill discipline cost us horribly
4928372 just to be able to get the top seed and not have to face the americans till the gold medal game is huge
4928373 also spain routed mali 79 47 with amaya valdemoro scoring 21 points the spaniards led 36 21 at the half and cruised to the rout despite 17 points from djenebou sissoko
4928374 we just knew we had to buckle down on defense and get stops to fuel our offense
4928375 after two free throws by russia jackson heated up scoring seven of the next 10 points for australia the reigning wnba mvps 3 pointer with 4 21 left gave australia a 44 41 advantage its first since early in the first quarter
4928376 we really got our running game going in the second half

4928391 il risarcimento del danno esistenziale e del macrodanno i punti di vista della psicologia forense e della medicina legale e sociale sui quesiti alle sezioni unite della corte di cassazione
4928392 la trasformazione dellart 2059 operata da questa stessa corte e dalla corte costituzionale in un
4928393 illegittimo ogni riferimento ad una generica categoria di danno esistenziale nella quale
4928394 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit
4928395 the scheme does not allow for there to be any reduction in wages
4928396 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4928397 theres some pretty grubby and horrible things that happen out there in remote workplaces where farmers have used foreign labour
4928398 if we dont regulate this scheme the illegal practices will continue
4928399 a worker should not earn one dollar less than an australian worker there should be appropriate levels of pastoral care and community involvement in deciding where these workers will be placed
4928400 im not overly comfortable about foreign labour coming into our workplaces but theres an undeniable labour shortage
4928401 im worried about these industries collapsing under the pressure of that labour shortage
4928402 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4928403 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4928404 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4928405 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4928406 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4928407 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4928408 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4928409 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4928410 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4928411 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4928412 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4928413 in illegal informal settlements there are a lot of social factors that come into being high on the list is drunkenness where a person drinks and forgets to put off the candle or they might leave a pot cooking on a stove and go and buy beer again

4928416 il danno esistenziale consiste nel pregiudizio di natura non meramente emotiva ed interiore ma oggettivamente accertabile provocato sul fare aredittuale del soggetto che alteri le sue abitudini e gli assetti relazionali propri inducendolo a scelte di vita diverse quanto allespressione e realizzazione della sua personalit nel mondo esterno
4928417 nessuno ormai nega che la perdita o la compromissione anche soltanto psichica della sessualit come avviene nei casi di stupro o di pedofilia costituisce di per s un danno esistenziale la cui rilevanza deve essere autonomamente apprezzata e valutata equitativamente in termini non patrimoniali e con una congrua stima dellequivalente economico del debito di valore
4928418 sussistendo un forte contrasto giurisprudenziale in seno alle sezioni semplici della suprema corte circa la configurabilit e la risarcibilit del danno esistenziale come terza sotto categoria autonoma ossia distinta dal danno biologico e dal danno morale soggettivo nellambito del danno non patrimoniale si rimettono gli atti del procedimento al primo presidente per leventuale assegnazione della causa alle sezioni unite
4928419 nel caso di morte di una persona per fatto illecito altrui i prossimi congiunti della vittima hanno diritto al risarcimento non solo del danno morale e del danno biologico ma anche del danno esistenziale consistente nella modificazione peggiorativa della loro personalit e nel conseguente forzoso sconvolgimento delle loro abitudini di vita e dei loro rapporti relazionali allinterno ed allesterno del nucleo familiare colpito
4928420 inviolabilit della libera e piena esplicazione delle attivit realizzative della persona umana nellambito della famiglia
4928421 assetti relazionali propri inducendo scelte di vita diverse quanto allespressione e realizzazione della sua personalit nel mondo esterno
4928422 che urta contro la natura e la funzione puramente risarcitoria della responsabilit aquiliana
4928423 dal punto di vista probatorio la prova del danno esistenziale determinato dalluccisione del congiunto pu essere fornita a mezzo di presunzioni dimostrando semplicemente lesistenza del rapporto di coniugio o di filiazione e della stabile convivenza con la vittima fornita tale prova ritenuta accertata la ripercussione negativa delluccisione sullassetto dei rapporti esistenti nel nucleo familiare incombe pertanto alla controparte lonere di vincere la presunzione fornendo la prova contraria dimostrando cio lassenza di un siffatto stabile sistema di relazioni familiari

4928435 costituendo la riparazione mediante indennizzo la forma minima di tutela che non assoggettabile a specifici limiti
4928436 adottati dal tribunale di milano nel 2004 hanno confermato ladesione a questi principi sempre che tuttavia venga leso altres il diritto alla salute si liquida prima il danno biologico
4928437 e perch non 50 000 00 o 100 000 00
4928438 sempre necessaria la prova dellentit del danno ossia la dimostrazione che la lesione ha prodotto una perdita di tipo analogo a quello indicato dallart
4928439 corte costituzionale n 372 94 la suprema corte nella citate sentenze n 8827 03 e 8828 03 ha ribadito che ogni qualvolta sia provata la lesione di un interesse costituzionale della persona devono essere risarciti il danno morale soggettivo
4928440 per danno esistenziale si intende ogni pregiudizio che lillecito datoriale provoca sul fare areddituale del soggetto alterando le sue abitudini di vita e gli assetti relazionali che gli erano propri sconvolgendo la sua quotidianit e privandolo di occasioni per la espressione e la realizzazione della sua personalit nel mondo esterno
4928441 cos come occorre analoga verifica nellambito della responsabilit contrattuale di tutti gli elementi della fattispecie integrante linadempimento contrattuale ex art
4928442 provoca sul fare areddituale del soggetto alterando le sue abitudini di vita e gli assetti relazionali che gli erano propri sconvolgendo la sua quotidianit e privandolo di occasioni per la espressione e la realizzazione della sua personalit nel mondo esterno
4928443 ma ha precisato che esso non esaurisce il danno non patrimoniale v anche cass 28 8 2007 n 18199
4928444 per danno biologico si intende la lesione temporanea o permanente allintegrit psico fisica della persona suscettibile di accertamento medico legale che esplica unincidenza negativa sulle attivit quotidiane e sugli aspetti dinamico relazionali della vita del danneggiato indipendentemente da eventuali ripercussioni sulla sua capacit di produrre reddito
4928445 in relazione allintegralit dei suoi riflessi pregiudizievoli rispetto a tutte le attivit le situazioni e i rapporti in cui la persona esplica se stessa nella propria vita non soltanto quindi con riferimento alla sfera produttiva ma anche con riferimento alla sfera spirituale culturale affettiva sociale sportiva e a ogni altro ambito e modo in cui il soggetto svolge la sua personalit e cio a tutte le attivit realizzatrici della persona umana
4928446 adottati dal tribunale di milano individuano un parametro generale che consente al giudice la corretta liquidazione di tutti i pregiudizi non patrimoniali sofferti dalla vittima
4928447 per converso se c anche lesione del bene salute non si riconosce alcun autonomo rilievo alla contemporanea lesione del diritto di autodeterminazione
4928448 la concezione unitaria della persona non impedisce che la valutazione equitativa di tutti i danni non patrimoniali possa anche essere unica senza una distinzione bens opportuna ma non sempre indispensabile tra quanto va riconosciuto a titolo di danno morale soggettivo e quanto a titolo di ristoro dei pregiudizi ulteriori e diversi dalla mera sofferenza psichica ovvero quanto deve essere liquidato a titolo di risarcimento del danno biologico in senso stretto

4928598 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
4928599 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
4928600 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
4928601 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
4928602 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
4928603 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
4928604 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
4928605 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
4928606 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
4928607 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
4928608 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
4928609 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
4928610 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
4928611 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
4928612 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
4928613 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
4928614 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
4928615 i am the only one who can look like they shopped at a muesem
4928616 hurry the hell up you slow ass well miss the train
4928617 shes not your lover dick forget about valentine shes long gone bitch didnt know how to love you anyway you deserve better than that
4928618 move along wont you youll have all night to enjoy the town for now weve got to get to an apartment old girlfriend of mine set one up for us free of charge on one condition
4928619 why the hell you freakin out you fell asleep playing that song you never quit playing
4928620 man i must be bat shit crazy then i swear i had the craziest dream j just dont fucking leave the room okay
4928621 okay but if you ask me for a kiss i will have to decline its already suspicious enough with us rooming together
4928622 lets go out tonight youre still caught up over her weve got to get you to forget about that bitch she fucked with your heart man i told you totally not worth your time
4928623 you know i want that boys soul you wont find me as easily slain as kravenu
4928624 ah sorry i let it catch up to us sven here was a bit of a pushover though all talk and no game
4928625 sorry i didnt tell you sooner risk these assholes are after you really theres only one reason for that
4928626 you belong in heaven i was ordered to bring you there
4928627 i was born into this world incarnated if you will for this sole purpose the almighty knew youd be born and that in your life the forces of hell would seek you no innocent soul would be lost to their legions so i was sent to be your guardian the legion mustve gotten the news a bit late thats why your parents were killed
4928628 now the only way to keep you safe is to bring you to heaven i am sure it seems a little drastic but youre the reason why the demons are here on earth dont think youre special youre just an ordinary human like everyone else the only thing that makes you different is that your soul is sought after
4928629 i am no angel but demons will find me to be quite the tenacious foe
4928630 sure just protect me if you can besides what the hell makes me so important
4928631 you see as long as your soul exists on earth angels and demons are allowed to come here it was an ancient pact that was made that banned both beings from being part of worldly affairs you know
4928632 then we wouldnt be assured your soul ends up in heaven besides killing someone else for such a thing is quite the sin even under these circumstances but ah you see if we take you to a holy ground and perform a ritual then we may simply bring you to heaven without taking your life
4928633 youre not going to find the bliss and comfort you desire in heaven you know
4928634 heaven is a place of harmony but you wont be going there normally in fact the only reason youll be there is so that we can somehow make the aspect of the portal separate from your soul neither angel nor demon should interfere with the lives of humans it is up to them to decide their fate
4928635 i missseded you master but i know you come down cave others say i stupid but i know i not bite hand that feeds no no ashiquel not stupid thouuugh not like using engleash you know
4928636 you let me come here master so let me protekt yous master other brothers and friends from home want kill you but you give us so much entire world you see so much
4928637 risk you cant just let a demon follow us what if its a trick theyre known for trickery
4928638 insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result

4928645 i was in contact with one of the owners and he was clear that we had some money and could spend for me it is clear they are supporting me
4928646 my commitment to the club is 100 per cent i have said a hundred times that my family are really happy here and i want to win trophies for liverpool
4928647 it was typical of him we know he can score those type of goals but the rest of the team still needs to play well and keep a clean sheet
4928648 we dropped off torres 25 yards from goal and he pulled the trigger thats why he cost a few bob and thats the beauty of the premier league
4928649 we tried in the 10 or 15 minutes and that probably affected our decision making
4928650 until then we had defended very well but a lot of teams do score late in the premier league
4928651 i was really pleased with the performance though i think we played some good stuff and created one or two good chances
4928652 but when you play the big boys youve got to take those chances it would have been very hard for liverpool if we had gone in front
4928653 im encouraged by the performance when we played teams like liverpool last season i hoped we would get a good result this morning i thought we would get a good result
4928654 liverpool will be delighted to see the back of us and thats a decent sign for us
4928655 he definitely wouldnt be out of place in origin definitely not
4928656 i think being named in this world cup squad is just a stepping stone for him now
4928657 he can take a lot of confidence out of that knowing that the selectors are fully aware of his abilities so hes just got to take it to the next step and keep growing as a footballer and im sure hes got a long rep future in front of him
4928658 id have to have words to him before the game maybe just ask him to be kind to me
4928659 hed certainly be very damaging and it would be pretty painful to see him in a sky blue jersey
4928660 hes just a freak and i love watching him play
4928661 obviously it was a tough week we had to address a few issues at the start of the week but full credit to the boys for the way they prepared for the game
4928662 i made a few easy mistakes but he played really really solid
4928663 you would probably have to put him as a darkhorse hes someone to watch

4928675 paul bevan for consistency over four quarters hes one who really stands out

4928677 hes a really good kid and he wants to compete every week and thats the trick in afl footy
4928678 he played on the norm smith medallist and then went to the possible 2008 brownlow medallist so it was a reasonably tough evening for the fella
4928679 i just hope we can get on top of it soon because if we continue to lose games we are a chance of not making the finals at all

4929136 if christians really want to persuade the world to follow christ it is critical that we do not appear to be manipulative in our techniques or our purpose if we are the result may well be that we inoculate the world against the gospel instead of leading the world to accept it

4929173 i didnt have my music on and my windows were rolled up
4929174 plus it was cold and i had my leather jacket on
4929175 they slammed me down on the ground put pistols and tasers to my back
4929176 i didnt know what they were here for they said it was for assaulting a peace officer

4929192 the reasoning was that those who were offended could turn away
4929193 but that doesnt prevent the state from criminalizing a verbal assault of repeated loud profanities in a public place that disrupts the rights of others
4929194 but you dont have the right to continue to assault people with offensive speech once theyve indicated they dont want to hear it
4929195 yesterday is history tomorrow a mystery today is a gift thats why its called the present
4929196 in february this year i chaired a lecture given by the archbishop of canterbury in the royal courts of justice on the topic of civil and religious law in england
4929197 it was i believe not clearly understood by all and certainly not by sections of the media which represented the archbishop as suggesting the possibility that muslims in this country might be governed by their own system of sharia law
4929198 a point that the archbishop was making was that it was possible for individuals voluntarily to conduct their lives in accordance with sharia principles without this being in conflict with the rights guaranteed by our law
4929199 in 2006 the equality act extended the prohibition against discrimination on the ground of religion or belief to cover other areas such as the provision of goods facilities and services the letting of premises and the provision of education
4929200 british law has comparatively recently reached a stage of development in which a high premium is placed not merely on liberty but on equality of all who live in this country that law is secular it does not attempt to enforce the standards of behaviour that the christian religion or any other religion expects it is perhaps founded on one ethical principle that the christian religion shares with most if not all other religions and that is that one should love ones neighbour
4929201 a muslim is supposed to deal with people kindly and justly unless they are open enemies to islam and or muslims allah does not prohibit you from being kind and just to those who have not fought you on account of religion nor expelled you from your homes
4929202 generally when one has entered their non muslim lands under a peaceful agreement he is expected to abide by common standards of decency as long as it does not violate any injuctions of islam usury is an example of a such a violation
4929203 a muslim is supposed to respect the human rights not only of muslims but even of non muslim subjects of the islamic state according to a tradition of the holy last messenger peace be upon him severe warning is reported for violating the property or lives of non muslim residents
4929204 muslims and non muslims should join hands with the government and run the country if the government is benevolent to muslims and not oppressive there are clear injunctions regarding this
4929205 this subversive terrorist act resulted in the severing of railway links between the east and west of georgia and connections with georgias seaports
4929206 moreover the bridge used to provide a route for refugees from the russian occupied territories into safe places russia is pursuing deliberate policy aimed at undermining georgias statehood including through bringing about humanitarian catastrophe
4929207 russian military helicopters started bombing the bordering territories of the city of borjomi and settlement of tsemi using incendiary munitions
4929208 russia needs to honor the agreement and withdraw its forces and of course end military operations
4929209 we have agreed that mr mugabe will be president whilst i become prime minister
4929210 we envisage that the prime minister must chair the cabinet and be responsible for the formulation execution and administration of government business including appointing and dismissing his ministers a prime minister cannot be given responsibility without authority and be expected to deliver
4929211 shall be commander in chief of the defense forces of zimbabwe
4929212 mr mugabe will be head of state and mr tsvangirai will be head of government with executive power
4929213 to help put zimbabwe on the right road to its recovery
4929214 consider opening portions of the outer continental shelf for drilling with appropriate safeguards and without taxpayer subsidies to big oil
4929215 this comprehensive democratic approach will ensure energy independence which is essential to our national security will create millions of good paying jobs here at home in a new green economy and will take major steps forward in addressing the global climate crisis

4929220 we all knew he was the only man friend of kim soo im he slept in the house many times the baby looks like the father
4929221 the south korean police and prosecutors hated her because she was the lover of lee gang kook and then of col baird and nobody could touch her they waited for their chance
4929222 the korean police at the time were notorious for fabricating evidence that didnt exist
4929223 it was truly an emotional moment for me to hear him say it
4929224 they would send her right back to the torture chamber
4929225 came to her begging her to save her my mother

4929230 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4929231 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4929232 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4929233 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4929234 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4929235 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4929236 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4929237 terribly sorry your honour tera patrick made me do it
4929238 somebody told me they saw green cheeseheads favre exclaimed afterward
4929239 anything surprise you about tonight favre was asked walking out of the stadium
4929240 yeah said a weary and hoarse and bloodshot eyed favre
4929241 that i could complete a pass do you know how different this offense is from what im used to
4929242 franks had trouble getting off the line keller had better leverage
4929243 i didnt have time to think said keller the best offensive tight end in the draft this year
4929244 you dont have time to think when the balls coming at you 100 miles an hour
4929245 just a different jersey he drove the ball against our first team defense
4929246 it worked out better than i thought it would he said
4929247 i thought i threw the ball well and moved around okay ten days ago i was doing yardwork
4929248 dream as big as you can dream and anything is possible
4929249 i am sort of in a dream world sometimes i have to pinch myself to make sure it is real
4929250 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4929251 when i did chop the last stroke i thought that had cost me the race
4929252 but it was actually the opposite if i had glided i would have been way too long i took short faster strokes to try to get my hand on the wall i ended up making the right decision
4929253 im so proud of what hes been able to do i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4929254 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4929255 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4929256 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4929257 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4929258 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4929259 i thought four one hundredths was close and i was shocked then
4929260 im even more shocked now than i was then one hundredth is the smallest margin of victory in our sport i guess its pretty cool
4929261 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4929262 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4929263 i wasnt going to at first then i was saying to myself this race is going to be very tight and im going to use everything i got so i put it out there
4929264 i always welcome comments it definitely motivates me even more
4929265 i saw his shadow in the corner of my goggles
4929266 my big goal is to change the sport of swimming
4929267 i am sure bob and i can think of some more goals in the next four years
4929268 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4929269 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4929270 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4929271 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing
4929272 the integration of ukrainian elements of missile early warning and space control systems with those of foreign countries that are interested in gathering space data

4929312 barang siapa yang memerintah kepada yang maruf dan mencegah dari yang munkar maka hendaknya dia memiliki ilmu tentang apa yang dia perintahkan dan apa yang dia larang lembut dan santun ketika memerintaha dan melarang hendaknya ilmu didahulukan sebelum memerintah sedangkan sikap lembut dan santun harus selalu menyertai perintah jika tidak berilmu maka ia tidak boleh mengerjakan apa yang dia tidak memiliki ilmu tentangnya
4929313 maka berbicaralah kamu berdua kepadanya firaun dengan kata kata yang lemah lembut mudah mudahan ia ingat atau takut
4929314 dan suruhlah manusia mengerjakan yang bai dan cegahlah mereka dari perbuatan yang munkar dan bersabarlah terhadap apa yang menimpa kamu sesungguhnya yang demikian itu termasuk hal hal yang diwajibkan
4929315 wajib bagi orang yang memerintah kepada yang maruf dan mencegah dari pada yang munkar untuk melakukannya dengan ikhlas karena allah dengan maksud taat kepada allah dan hendaklah tujuannya untuk memperbaiki orang yang diperintah menegakkan hujjah kepadanya dan jangan bertujuan untuk mencari kedudukan baik untuk dirinya maupun kelompoknya atau untuk melecehkan orang lain pondasi agama adalah cinta karena allah benci karena allah loyalitas karena allah bermusuhan karena allah ibadah hanya karena allah meminta pertolongan hanya kepada allah memberi hanya karena allah dan mencegah pun hanya karena allah hal demikian tidak lain hanya dengan mengikuti rasulullah shalallahu alaihi wa sallam yang perintahnya adalah perintah allah dan larangannya adalah larangan allah taat kepadanya adalah taat kepada allah dan maksiat kepadanya adalah maksiat kepada allah
4929316 barangsiapa di antara kamu melihat kemungkaran maka hendaklah ia mengubah dengan tangannya maka barangsiapa tidak mampu mengubah dengan tangannya hendaklah ia mengubah dengan lisannya dan barangsiapa tidak mampu mengubah dengan lisannya hendaklah ia mengubah dengan hatinya tetapi yang demikian itu adalah selemah lemah iman

4929355 dont play with my brand never mess with the logo
4929356 when nobody know whats going on people turn to market technicals
4929357 it seems most everyone is turning in their spreadsheets for some charts with talk of the all too common
4929358 to translate this talk basically means that the dow coiled itself into a tightening band and the sages helpfully tell us that the pattern tends to be resolved by the index breaking hard one way or the other so lets get this straight often after a period when nothing much happens something happens
4929359 if professional investors are bored then individuals are fleeing equities investors have pulled nearly 60 billion from stock mutual funds this year while adding more than 70 billion to money market funds and small cds
4929360 corporate insiders have been on a selling strike for nearly two months the dollar based ratio of insider sales to buys has been in the bullish zone pretty much all year and down 90 from a year ago
4929361 for what its worth my own expectation is that we are close in time to an upturn of some consequence but that the market needs one more down thrust of some energy
4929362 the geographically challenged mr huckabee whose strongest card seems to be his amiability demonstrated to the apparent satisfaction of the states republicans that he was a regular guy by donning some hunting gear and shooting at flocks of quizzical birds but in fact our iowa sources tell us he was really after bigger game he was keen on picking off some pakistani terrorists who he implied have been sneaking into iowa by the thousands to do their mischief
4929363 for mr huckabee seems to have confused pakistan with mexico in terms of their respective locations and also seems to believe that iowa borders on mexico pakistan we must admit we never did a thorough survey of the state in the considerable time we spent in such places as red oak and iowa city so it could be hes discovered a hitherto unknown sliver of the state that snakes its way undetected to the nations southern border were quite eager to see what comparable revelations mr huckabees journeys through new hampshire yield
4929364 the country is living during a very special period in its history based on the holding of the legislative elections of september 05

4929366 this is the countrys contribution to the global efforts against climate change
4929367 today firewood in the north is an intensive commercial activity it is a major source of employment for the people and if it is to be stopped an alternative source of employment must be sought
4929368 during this period we just have to pitch mosquito nets on the verandas and sleep outside our rooms throughout
4929369 for 9 or 10 years now the river beds have been empty these are streams which at one point were permanent but today you can find water in them only at the peak of the rainy season

4929379 shit there are plenty of photographers wholl shoot me for free
4929380 defensively i thought we did a great job against the run early
4929381 offensively that raises nervousness in terms of being able to run obviously given where we are with the offensive line and an inexperienced quarterback you like to not put all the pressure on the throwing game it was a huge deal for us to find a way to run the ball with some consistency going into the tennessee game
4929382 not much it was not what it needs to be were not necessarily game planning out there in a scrimmage sometimes when the defense was stacked in the box wed throw the ball
4929383 if were going to do that we have to be competent enough to catch the pass and not turn it over
4929384 this is not a game that you evaluate personnel this is a game where we make sure we get plays run and make sure we get ready to go
4929385 we dont play ucla youve got to keep that in mind ucla is not on our schedule we wanted to run plays and get out of that thing
4929386 but sometimes its important in scrimmage situations to see how guys respond to that so i thought he passed the test of not going in the tank because it wasnt going well
4929387 its just like you wouldnt let your son drive until he knew all the rules but you know he can drive someday

4929438 when addicts could carry on like normal people drugs were cheap and it didnt take a lot of money to get all you needed an addict kept his respect and remained congenial and polite to meet him then you wouldnt have known he was a drug fiend
4929439 maintain a constant check on the number of addicts in any community it would also protect the life of the addict and support him as a useful member of society this existence would hasten his rehabilitation or at least reduce the amount of his addiction since many of the stresses in the addicts life would be reduced

4929497 nein so was hab ich wirklich nicht ich gehe nur ein zweimal im jahr in den wald um schwammerln zu suchen daf r bezahl ich doch kein geld
4929498 die paar pilze die ich mitnehme sind doch keine 45 euro wert die schwammerlmaut ist eine frechheit
4929499 ich bin doch kein pilzr uber sondern ein hobbysammler ich gehe gern in den wald und wenn ich eine portion eierschwammerln sammle reicht mir das die hohen herren sollten lieber gezielt gegen die pilzdiebe aus ita lien vorgehen und nicht die bev lkerung ausbeuten
4929500 viele glauben sie gilt auf der gesamten koralpe ich bin zum beispiel gar nicht betroffen trotzdem bleiben die touristen auf meiner seite aus
4929501 wer kennt sich schon genau aus wann er welche waldgrenze berschreitet und pl tzlich auf vignettenpflichtigem gebiet steht
4929502 ja die pilzmafia schw rmt wieder aus jedes jahr das gleiche
4929503 dass wir ein problem mit dreisten schwammerlr ubern haben ist bekannt
4929504 wegen schwammerldiebst hlen bekommen wir keinen richterlichen hausdurchsuchungsbefehl die m ssten schon mit waffen oder schmuck handeln
4929505 pro kopf darf jeder zwei kilogramm pilze pro tag sammeln die r uber legen sich im wald depots an mit jeweils zwei kilo im gep ck machen sie sich auf den r ckweg bei einer kontrolle k nnen wir ihnen nichts nachweisen
4929506 halten sich ber 90 prozent der pilz sucher an das zwei kilogramm gesetz
4929507 in den kommenden tagen werden wir ein programm ausarbeiten und den waldbesitzern pr sentieren ich bin optimistisch dass die pilz vignette bald geschichte ist eine indirekte subvention an die grundbesitzer wird es vom land aber sicher nicht geben
4929508 aber wir haben sicher nicht bewusst vor dem hanappi stadion plakatieren lassen ich glaube au erdem nicht dass man die standorte so genau ausw hlen kann
4929509 die rapid fans stehen ber solchen dingen wir brauchen auch keine plakatw nde wir haben die meisten und die besten fans die meisten mitglieder und die meisten zuschauer im stadion

4929562 is the exhibition of a way or method of living which men should cultivate as the highest and purest development of their nature
4929563 taoism as the word indicates is the religion of the tao a term meaning path or way but denoting in this peculiar case the way course or movement of the universe her processes and methods in other words taoism is the religion of heaven and earth of the cosmos of the world or nature in the broadest sense of these words hence we may call it naturism

4929567 the only work which is known to be truly the production of lao keun is the ta u tih king which has maintained its reputation and secured a popularity to a certain extent among reading men generally of every denomination
4929568 no other writing has come down to us from the pencil of l o tsze its author
4929569 we know that lao tzu wrote the tao t ching
4929570 the tao t ching is a genuine relic of one of the most original minds of the chinese race putting his thoughts on record 2400 years ago
4929571 there is little room left for doubts regarding the authenticity of our canon
4929572 he wrote with a view to asperse the confucian school and to glorify the mysteries of lao tze his teachings are like an overwhelming flood which spreads at its own sweet will consequently from rulers and ministers downwards none could apply them to any definite use
4929573 here we have the key to the triumph of the tao of confucius over the tao of lao tze the latter was idealistic the former a practical system for every day use
4929574 taoism being fundamentally a religion of the cosmos and its subdivisions old chinese cosmogony is its theogony it conceives the universe as one large organism of powers and influences a living machine the core of which is the great ultimate principle or comprising the two cosmic breaths or souls known as the yang and the yin of which respectively heaven and earth are the chief depositories these two souls produce the four seasons and the phenomena of nature represented by the lineal figures called kwa
4929575 there are medical authors who ascribe to man an indefinite number of souls or soul parts or as they express it a hundred shen those souls they say shift in the body according to the age of the owner so e g when he is 25 31 68 or 74 and older they dwell in his forehead so that it is then very dangerous to have boils or ulcers there because effusion of the blood would entail death at other times of life they nestle under the feet or in other parts and limbs and only in the 21st 38th 41st and 50th years of life they are distributed equally through the body so that open abscesses wherever they appear do not heal then at all such pathologic nonsense regulates of course medical practice to a high degree

4929600 sure fucking enough he did have a gun which sent this entire little bar into fucking calamity
4929601 is this motherfucker gonna shoot this glass door in or what city hall east is only 5 fucking blocks donut eating pig i could have walked over there faster than the real donut eating pigs did by driving over there so its understandable that people are a little worried luckily for the sake of the city the gunman ran off when he couldnt get in and no one else was hurt hooray and the when the cops finally did come the one who graced our presence inside the bar was a tuna melt cop and by that i mean a good ol fashioned a real classic if you will she was greeted by a sarcastic yet welcoming round of applause she wobbles in with a you could set your watch to and starts asking questions i noticed that the male cops are sitting in their now ridiculously overly air conditioned police cruisers that are parked outside this corner eatery its as if they sent their minion in to do all the paper work at this point this scene is no longer scary the panic has all but subsided and orders can be heard from every corner of the bar from people asking for shots as if everyone only now realizes what had just happened the entire scene now exudes the air of a comedy its fucking hilarious and people are laughing joking and actually really having a genuinely good time people start to give the female officer all sorts of answers some are right and some are incredibly wrong and the bartender is the one directing the officer towards who to ask for information just then i realize that this is a regulars bar and that even though i saw that shit from the get go not even the instinct of a cop will sway this officer from the managers hand picked selection of witnesses since i became aware that nobody was ever going to ask me the selfishness in me realized that i should have swiped that fools cash after all just like im sure that the bar manager did thousand aire and i feel a little lump of regret in my throat to further complicate matters both mentally and financially now i was handed my bill soon after the incident all the while the cops are interviewing a bunch of idiots that were at the other end of the bar and didnt even see that shit im thinking i could have gotten shot with a stray bullet walked my ass out of the store because it was evidently very unsafe and this sunnovabitch is giving me a check now the timing certainly caught me off guard but the surly look on his face caught me even worse i decide that even if he doesnt have the timing and good server the 25 tab was definitely worth the price of admission well since im alive that is he probably wouldve ratted me out anyway if i had taken that dudes cash wads of cash because apparently no one else saw me but this lone server this includes the cops who failed to ask the person seated closest to the action about what had actually happened brilliantly handled apd buh rill eant needless to say both of those motherfuckers fighting over the gun got away and i got to hand out a little street justice myself in the form of a would i have even told the cop anything you know what i dont think i would have because the only people they hurt were well no one i guess so fuck it the downside is of course that there is still a gun out there that could kill somebody but if i rat that person out my guess is that somebody would be me selfishness and the ineptness of a cop win out again praised or vilified
4929602 feed not the dragon the soup of the tiger or he may piss like a dog
4929603 the low grade friction from shaving stimulates collagen production and smoothes the skin thats one of the reasons men typically have far fewer wrinkles than women do
4929604 im going out there to try to play quarterback as well as i can and let it go from there
4929605 we want to make a good decision and we will
4929606 im confident ill say it again i like all three of them i thought tonight all three of them did a nice job
4929607 as an offense you need to make some plays to get into a rhythm and to get a tempo going
4929608 tonight our tempo stunk i didnt make any plays so i take that squarely on my shoulders a lot of times a quarterback if hes making plays can get the offense going and i didnt make any plays
4929609 its our job as an offense to go out there and score touchdowns
4929610 tonight we moved the ball consistently and we want to keep putting the ball into the end zone
4929611 i missed two big opportunities the long ball to josh and the ball to jason in the back of the end zone
4929612 those two stick out other than that i thought i played pretty decent but when you miss two big chances like that you cant get it out of your head
4929613 the productivity wasnt there for the offense so i cant sit up here and say the quarterback played well
4929614 it was not a good evening for all of our quarterbacks
4929615 thats the way you like to see an offense execute
4929616 we will go back to the drawing board as far as our approach we have to play a lot smarter in every single area
4929617 seattle played pretty well but we hurt ourselves for the most part
4929618 sri lanka is one of the toughest places to play cricket as you dont get a lot of runs on slow low wickets you have to always stay positive
4929619 obviously i have to face a better attack when i play the odi but my innings was against an international side with mendis and muralitharan sri lanka will have a potent attack
4929620 theres a couple of balls there that we would have liked him to come up with
4929621 thats discouraging because he was paid an awful lot of money paid like one of the top five receivers in the nfl we need him to make those plays
4929622 at the end of everything all that matters as you take everything in is how do you perform on game day for him not to make those plays
4929623 its a very big concern because we do want to do a number of things with jamarcus in the passing game
4929624 the more they make plays the more that builds confidence for him and for all of us it means a less conservative role
4929625 all chinese people look the same to you because you are a racist
4929626 all chinese people look the same to you because you are a racist

4929661 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
4929662 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
4929663 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

4929665 i contend that we are both atheists i just believe in one fewer god than you do when you understand why you dismiss all the other possible gods you will understand why i dismiss yours

4929669 heathrow does not compete with gatwick and does not compete with stansted or luton or manchester
4929670 it competes with charles de gaulle in paris dubai now and amsterdams schiphol because these are big international hub airports so the ownership of the airports has nothing to do with competition
4929671 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4929672 al comune di catania siamo dinanzi a un disastro di proporzioni immani che pagheranno interamente i cittadini
4929673 nuova sentenza della corte dei conti pubblicata il 12 dicembre scorso che conferma lillegittimit delloperazione catania risorse avviata dalla giunta scapagnini per tentare di risanare il deficit comunale
4929674 lintervento di tutte le istituzioni da parte della prefettura di catania spiega che deve subito monitorare la situazione e informare il governo nazionale da parte dellassessorato regionale agli enti locali che non pu consentire ulteriori coperture dinanzi a cos tante e gravi violazioni di legge ed eventualmente anche da parte della magistratura ordinaria perch si ponga fine a questo scempio
4929675 di fronte alla situazione drammatica e alla incapacit di trovare un serio criterio di risanamento del comune di catania oggi abbiamo ribadito la richiesta di dimissioni al sindaco scapagnini e alla sua giunta al ragioniere generale bruno e al direttore generale e presidente di catania risorse giacalone inoltre abbiamo annunciato un esposto alla procura generale presso la corte dei conti di palermo
4929676 io e salvo cannata il segretario provinciale del pdci ci recheremo in procura abbiamo inoltre annunciato unazione in assessorato regionale che ha poteri di intervento e controllo e che dinanzi allo sfascio resta inerte e in silenzio
4929677 il piano di rientro del deficit del comune di catania proposto dal sindaco scapagnini vuoto al suo interno non c nulla e abbiamo la certezza che non vi sia nulla
4929678 i tre grossi interventi proposti da scapagnini sono strumenti inutilizzabili perch inesistenti nellordinamento giuridico italiano quando non in aperto contrasto il primo riguarda la cessione pro soluto dei debiti che nellordinamento italiano esiste solo sui crediti il secondo relativo alla trasformazione della famigerata catania risorse srl in catania futura spa con lingresso di capitali privati unoperazione impossibile perch catania risorse opera gi in una situazione di illegittimit sancita dalla corte dei conti la terza opzione poi grottesca perch vorrebbe accorpare le scuole senza rispettare alcun vincolo e ad anno scolastico in corso
4929679 quello che sta accadendo al comune di catania mi ricorda gli ultimi giorni di pompei quando tutti scappano cercando di portar via qualche cianfrusaglia ma lesito sara implacabile per tutti ormai e finita scapagnini al piu tardi martedi si dimettera e abbandonera la citta nel pieno disastro finanziario e caos amministrativo

4929691 for too long australian farmers have become sick to death of watching their own fruit rotting on the vine because they couldnt get a worker there to pick the fruit mr burke told reporters today

4929693 in fact for employers it will be marginally more expensive to access this scheme than it would have been had australian workers been available
4929694 with more property listings and a decline in the number of sales prices are not increasing as rapidly now down to single digits overall which is good news from an affordability standpoint
4929695 the housing market is at a balanced state sellers have more competition sales of detached properties in may 2008 declined 33 4 per cent to 1 203 from the 1 805 sales
4929696 its the equivalent of an interest free loan from the government

4929719 the only time he was loud was when he and grandma were shouting at each other he used to love the singer hibari misora he listened to her all the time so maybe that had an influence on me
4929720 i think as most of us get older and gain experience we make friends lose friends people move away or pass away there are lots of things that keep us busy but sometimes when we slow down for a moment we think of things we value most
4929721 if i write for example ill do anything for you someone ive never known and never met may come up later and ask for some huge favor ill have to explain that its just a song

4929723 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4929724 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up
4929725 thats something im working toward theres a lot of music here and a lot of different tastes i would like people in the u s to know not only who i am but what i have to say there are not many singers from asia who have been successful here despite that america is a wonderful place for music the place ive always said that my ultimate goal is to win a grammy award maybe by doing that i could really attract a lot of fans here

4929729 its using symbols that i recognise and everyone would recognise for me its a way of being coached very objectively and i dont even have to share it because sometimes with coaches we dont want to share the situation we just want someone to talk us through it
4929730 when this first occurred i said whatever the republicans do with their delegations we will do the same the difference is we will have a food fight in the middle

4929732 although housing prices on a year over year comparison continue to show single digit percentage increases we are beginning to see more price reductions in properties listed on the market today

4929739 i felt good in the first 400m of this race and at the 800m and 900m i started believing that i could win
4929740 it was all calculated i slowed down in the penultimate 100m to save my energy and attack in the final 50m
4929741 i knew i had a lot of speed but i wasnt 100 percent sure i knew this was going to be a challenge i had a pretty good race in the 400 freestyle but it didnt happen for me

4929754 my greatest moral failing and i have been a very imperfect person is the failure of my first marriage
4929755 with republicans we usually think of them as comfortable in an evangelical setting
4929756 its big news that a democrat will be in that setting and obamas much more comfortable in that world
4929757 i believe that jesus christ died for my sins and that i am redeemed through him that is a source of strength and sustenance on a daily basis

4929864 for the naysayers out there that would say the lights are out the lights are very dim on sco and its only a matter of time until there are no lumens coming out of the light bulbs and the games over thats far from what the truth is
4929865 the truth is the substantial amount of investment weve put into this mobile business in the past four years its in the tens of millions of dollars is now ready to go into harvest mode
4929866 we think itll actually be a killer application in the world of mobile phones
4929867 theyre going to the organizations that rely on franklincovey and will listen to them with an open mind
4929868 they actually have a decent pedigree with regard to their technical skills
4929869 but the problem is they carry so much baggage along with their corporate name that getting somebody to take a meeting so they can pitch the product is incredibly difficult im not convinced they can ramp the volume
4929870 itll be a lot more valuable out from beneath the sco brand
4929871 we really have a lot of confidence in it its very fast its easy to use youre always connected in real time its talking to a server and its always being updated
4929872 as we move forward at some point well have to answer that question what i can say is im very committed to sco stakeholders to finish off this battle that we started five years ago we believe it is time now to go in and get things finished off

4929876 qu fuerza que car cter y que belleza que tienen todos estos personajes femeninos
4929877 what im afraid of is that many of those who deserve to receive benefits but dont speak english will find themselves being dragged through a process that they dont understand
4929878 you can be sure though that the employers and the insurance company will have their attorneys on hand
4929879 what were we going to do try to modify the language
4929880 were we going to say that a person who cant return to work because theyre in jail or committed crimes isnt eligible for continuing benefits but if theyre in this country illegally theyre exempt
4929881 that would be like saying because youre in this country illegally and cant work here weve decided to retire you with full benefits
4929882 this law was designed to address worker compensation benefit issues there are other laws in place that address those employers who hire workers who are in this country illegally
4929883 this is part of the reason for the huge explosion in self publishing made possible when technology and print on demand publishers gave writers the keys to the factory
4929884 you can publish pretty much anything you can think of
4929885 i think weve just scratched the surface weve got a hundred million ideas of things we want to do
4929886 the revolution in publishing is self publishing an author a creator of any kind can now take their fate in their own hands
4929887 most should self publish to make more money to get to press sooner to keep control of their work
4929888 you get more credibility for a printed book than for an e book

4929897 who will see my magic no one knows me as a magician
4929898 my aim is to come here and win thats the aim i have a lot more time to think about that
4929899 the way his stride pattern goes together in the first 40 meters is amazing
4929900 you have to give it to him im not going to say hes the epitome of a sprinter there are many different kinds of sprinters
4929901 a lot of people believe you had to be short and stocky to be a sprinter
4929902 usain is defying that at 6 5 this is the beginning of something else to come
4929903 you guys from the states like to quote vince lombardi winning isnt everything its the only thing he could probably go faster i dont think he has an idea he came here to win and he won
4929904 i wanted to be champion and thats what i came out to do i wasnt worried about the world record didnt know i got the world record until after i ran the victory lap my aim was to be olympic champion and i did that
4929905 it worked out better than i thought it would not that i thought it would go badly
4929906 it was like starting all over again i had some feelings that i havent felt in 17 years but thats a good thing
4929907 ive been throwing the ball well i just feel like once i get the timing down with these guys ill be ok
4929908 there are times where he rushes through it we have to get him to slow down stay in rhythm stay within the reads and not force it
4929909 hes a talented young man hes very athletic he runs very well has a strong arm but hes got to settle down in the pocket
4929910 hes the same person but as a player hes different
4929911 the last full year 2004 i was with him he threw for 3 500 yards and when gary kubiak had him 2006 he completed 68 percent of his passes
4929912 hes like a lot of young guys they lose their confidence pro athletes have very fragile egos so we just have to try to get them in stride build their confidence get them to believe in themselves and to believe in the system i think thats how you get a guy back going in the right direction
4929913 i think hes starting to have a little success i think hes starting to understand what coach tom coughlin wants from the quarterback position
4929914 we talk about that all the time he has a very quick release and hes got a strong arm hes getting to a point in his life where hes going to start hurting his elbow and shoulder if he doesnt become more mechanically sound
4929915 first of all t o s 10 times faster than brandon marshall and 10 times stronger than brandon marshall you can get your hands on b at the line but t o has a good thing where he snatches and rips
4929916 right now i feel great and i feel like im at the top of my game
4929917 i cant get complacent where im at but im never going to say theres another man better than me chad johnsons not better than me thats how i look at things
4929918 like i said last year football to me is like pop warner halftime pop tarts and kool aid
4929919 my main goal is to win offensive rookie of the year
4929920 i want to come in and do the same thing adrian peterson came in and did last year i think thats possible
4929921 every time we play a game its campaigning for the rookie of the year
4929922 if i do what i have to do to help this team succeed then the rookie of the year should come and everything else should fall into place for us as a team
4929923 you guys want to select one reporter and well put him in just shoulder pads out here and come out for a 9 on 7 someday
4929924 you guys go ahead you need to sign a waiver and id be happy to put you out there in the 9 on 7 and then you could comment afterward on if you think its soft or not
4929925 they take their shoes off and run around all the time maybe his feet were hurting that day well educate him a little and tell him to keep his shoes on until he gets inside
4929926 i hope that if i play like i know im capable of playing then maybe ill be here in the future and be able to keep my job if i go out there and stink up the joint then maybe ill have to move on
4929927 at some point every team has got to get younger dick vermeil believed in veteran guys and herm believes in draft picks thats what every team goes through when it changes coaches
4929928 playing green bay on monday night to start the season thats everything you want
4929929 hopefully i can put my helmet square in the back of his spine if i can do that and knock the ball loose itll be a good day
4929930 surely this time people will be infuriated and protest this lie cover up obvious bad move
4929931 summer pursuits in the good ol days or more recently
4929932 sukar untuk menerangkan perkara itu kepada ahli dan juga orang umno yang menyokong pas

4929934 adakah kemasukan 30 ahli parlimen itu akan menguntungkan orang melayu dan agama islam
4929935 pendekatan menghukum menyebabkan orang menjadi takut tetapi jika pendekatan dakwah insya allah orang akan mengikut kita
4929936 kita memberi jaminan bahawa semua perkara dirujuk kepada parti dan kalau perlu muktamar khas diadakan untuk mendapat kata putus mengenai perkara tersebut
