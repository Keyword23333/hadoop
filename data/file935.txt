9350000 i havent talked to anyone who isnt ecstatic about this pick
9350001 i dont think the foreign policy experience is that big of a deal
9350002 its important to pick someone that shares your values is bright competent and has leadership abilities
9350003 there will be plenty of opportunities to learn that stuff as the number two
9350004 republicans scrambled saturday to make contingency plans for changing the tone of their national convention worried that televised images of a lavish celebration would provide a jarring contrast to scenes of disaster and mass evacuations
9350005 mccain advisers also said that the meticulously planned event may have to be radically altered if the storm begins to grow into a calamity like katrina
9350006 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9350007 if it looks like its going to hit we will obviously drastically change our plans
9350008 there is official business that is required to happen at the convention like the actual nomination of john mccain and the platform ratification but an official added contingency plans are being considered regarding delegation travel and the program of speakers the republican national convention has set up a committee in saint paul to monitor hurricane gustav and evaluate its impact on the convention schedule
9350009 sen john mccain r ariz may deliver his acceptance speech via satellite because of the historically huge hurricane threatening new orleans top officials said
9350010 at least 10 incumbent senators plus several senate candidates have sent their regrets only three incumbents in hotly contested races including kentuckys mitch mcconnell the senate minority leader will join the partygoers
9350011 republicans assembling in the twin cities are faced with a sobering reality check the gop has never confronted such steep political odds in modern times
9350012 with the popularity of president bush in the cellar issues like the war in iraq and gas prices and change becoming the watchword of the election season the gop is counting on mccain to come through on what many political observers say may be mission impossible in 2008 keeping control of the white house
9350013 mccain risks ceding the most effective argument he and fellow republicans have made against obama
9350014 for months republicans have attacked the senator from illinois as not ready to be president now mccain has put someone who democrats argue has even less experience one election and a heartbeat away from the presidency
9350015 the selection of gov sarah palin of alaska proved quintessentially mccain daring hazardous and defiantly off message he demonstrated that he would not get boxed in by convention as he sought to put a woman next in line to the presidency for the first time yet in making such an unabashed bid for supporters of senator hillary rodham clinton he risked undercutting his central case against senator barack obama
9350016 over the next 72 hours whether she becomes a new star of the gop or an albatross will be determined in large part by a wave of second and third day news coverage about mccains unexpected running mate
9350017 naturally there will be the usual articles about her record in passing bills in alaska and her positions on certain hot button issues but the inquiries that have the most potential to explode will delve into more sensitive terrain
9350018 the investigation is focusing on whether she and her aides pressured and ultimately fired the public safety commissioner walter monegan for not removing palins ex brother in law from the state police force
9350019 interviews with principals involved in the dispute and a review of court documents and police internal affairs reports reveal that palin has been deeply involved in alerting state officials to her familys personal turmoil
9350020 alaskas former commissioner of public safety claims that gov sarah palin john mccains pick to be vice president personally talked to him on two occasions about a state trooper who was locked in a bitter custody battle with the governors sister
9350021 in a phone conversation friday night walt monegan who was alaskas top cop until palin fired him july 11 told the anchorage daily news that the governor also had e mailed him two or three times about the trooper mike wooten though the e mails didnt mention wooten by name
9350022 palin is likely to be deposed soon in the case according to state sen hollis french who leads the state senates legislative counsel committee
9350023 frenchs committee unanimously authorized an investigation into the dismissal of the states public safety commissioner walt monegan who claims he balked at pressure to remove trooper mike wooten who had an acrimonious divorce from palins sister
9350024 a visit designed more to remind voters of they he arent than of who they are
9350025 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9350026 gun toting bitter people who cling to religion out of fear not faith
9350027 it may sould hypocritial but down state we get our meat from supermarkets
9350028 if this hurricane had happened during the dnc you folks would be saying this is gods will so what ya saying now
9350029 senator biden provided a lot of political cover for the credit card industry because they wanted to show that the proposal had bipartisan support he aggressively undermined the opposition to the bill
9350030 they now know that they were used as decoys well after mccain had decided not to pick them
9350031 the party disarray that the gop had predicted would befall the dnc convention never ever materialized
9350032 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9350033 governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9350034 it turns out the women of american arent finished yet we can shatter that glass ceiling
9350035 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9350036 governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9350037 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9350038 governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9350039 a bipartisan state legislative panel has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether palin improperly brought the family fight into the governors office the investigation is focusing on whether she and her aides pressured and ultimately fired the public safety commissioner walter monegan for not removing palins ex brother in law from the state police force
9350040 john mccain says the problem is washington hasnt done anything in 30 years what he doesnt say is hes been there 26
9350041 and he said no to higher fuel efficiency standards on cars he said no to making sure that we are investing in renewable fuels he has been dr no when it comes to energy
9350042 they now know that they were used as decoys well after mccain had decided not to pick them
9350043 even as she drew increasing attention nationally as a potential vice presidential nominee in recent months she has come under withering criticism at home from business minded republicans who consider her a misguided populist and an intellectual lightweight
9350044 critics call her naive a panderer in her economic populism and reckless in her dealings with the vital oil industry
9350045 what has biden done in the energy business sitting on his hands
9350046 we should all be proud of governor sarah palins historic nomination and i congratulate her and senator mccain
9350047 governor palin will add an important new voice to the debate
9350048 thank you everyone for supporting the reunion of the eraserheads we however regret to inform you that due to my brothers poor health because of the emotional a nd physical stress that his been experiencing we apologize for cutting the concert short my brother had to be rushed to the hospital for medical attention again we apologize and thank you all of you for coming here tonight

9350090 we continue to evaluate the track of the storm and i know there is tremendous interest in whether well have any scheduling changes there is not a scheduling change to speak of tonight but at the white house we are making contingency plans should the president decide against traveling to minnesota for the rnc convention
9350091 this is a very serious storm and the president is asking people in the region to listen to their local officials heed their warnings and evacuate if asked
9350092 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9350093 i think hes going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president
9350094 with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done
9350095 we will leave no stone unturned until we bring zawaharii to justice in a court
9350096 john mccain chose someone who was a mayor of a town of 7 000 people then was elected governor has been governor of a state for 1800 for 18 months governor of a state thats half the population of franklin county
9350097 and yet shes gonna be a heartbeat away from the president no way
9350098 after 19 months of traversing this country traveling to every state except alaska which now that i think about it
9350099 she seems to have a wonderful engaging personality and you know the fact that she got elected governor of alaska i think shows shes got real political skill
9350100 i think that ultimately she subscribes to the same economic theories and foreign policy theories as john mccain does
9350101 i think those are the wrong theories for this country
9350102 i think he got some post office naming bill passed
9350103 she seems to have a wonderful engaging personality and you know the fact that she got elected governor of alaska i think shows shes got real political skill
9350104 gosh i wish people were informed its tedious having to do teach everyone in here
9350105 we want a maverick outsider to bring in fresh new energy
9350106 the person who took care of all the business was my mother
9350107 my father had no idea about the family business what oil leases he owned in oklahoma
9350108 one time john mccains mother bought a house to remodel
9350109 does anyone else find it a little unsettling that less than a month ago ms palin you know mr mccains vp candidate had to ask what the vice president does all day
9350110 the church wasnt racist just black i can understand how it can be thought that way but the media stroke a cultural difference to try to turn it into a story
9350111 mack obama ran against hillary for 18 months if she didnt find anything beyond today they will not
9350112 mack obamas gone through the most thoughrough vetting process that weve ever seen its all out there and the people have had the chance to see it judge it and then vote for it if they chose the fact that hes here now is indicative of the results of that vetting
9350113 mack youre right obama is a huge liar he totally lied about his abortion voting record until the smoking gun got the papers and proved him a liar all you obamabots are being fooled but thank god enough people out there are finding out and mccain will win
9350114 yet a presidential candidate who has a long relationship with the unrepentant terrorist bill ayers
9350115 pledging your allegiance to africa and blaming all your community owes on white europeans isnt racist
9350116 wright is not obama and mccain has his own preacher problem that he had to separate himself from
9350117 mack youre right liberals hate america ive known this for years
9350118 mack obama never said that the media did i guess anybody you meet every sunday is your mentor uh o catholics are in trouble
9350119 if you truly believe someone you meet every sunday is your mentor then a whole host of people will be in trouble
9350120 mack are you listening to this i love watching them squirm and try to excuse the rev wright his mentor and their 20 year membership in that church a church so bad that even oprah left wow
9350121 if obamas impressive rhetoric even matched his past record and actions even 10 id have more respect for him
9350122 i heard sarah palin speak at a mccain rally in washington pennsylvania today
9350123 hillary is on our side now and i am sure she didnt like hearing about how palin called her a whiner
9350124 the election season has gotten a lot funnier with her selection some of her views e g man does not contribute to global warming doesnt believe in evolution suggest that she might also think that earth is flat
9350125 while were at it lets get her a slot on all the sunday shows i mean biden has been there should be no problem for you new palin fans right
9350126 i may not believe what she believes but at least you know what you are getting with her
9350127 the fact that mccain did not even take the time to vet palin speaks volumes aobut his judgement
9350128 shes a good mother and an up and coming politician
9350129 i will eliminate capital gains taxes for the small businesses and start ups that will create the high wage high tech jobs of tomorrow
9350130 that neal boortz said that obama was going to raise taxes these small businessmen obama said he is going to eliminate him there i knew it boortz is a liar
9350131 o problema que o clube n o conseguiu contratar ningu m
9350132 palin who portrays herself as a fiscal conservative racked up nearly 20 million in long term debt as mayor of the tiny town of wasilla that amounts to 3 000 per resident she argues that the debt was needed to fund improvements
9350133 she is a complete package she is right on all the issues particularly pro life and drilling for oil
9350134 but look at her she searched her soul and then did the right thing so should all women
9350135 palin and her staff complained that efforts to raise these issues in public were divisive and hypothetical
9350136 muchacho ya somos grandes y todavia no sabes que norma tenes en tu pais
9350137 o problema que o clube n o conseguiu contratar ningu m
9350138 the presence of hedge funds would induce greater competitive pressure for other regulated fund management channels such as mutual funds
9350139 as for that vp talk all the time i tell ya i still cant answer that question until until somebody answers for me what it is exactly that the vice president does every day
9350140 i served with hillary clinton i know hillary clinton hillary clinton is a friend of mine you sarah palin are no hillary clinton
9350141 if you are going to go after barack obama on experience this pick makes no sense
9350142 we just dont know how shell handle the next nine weeks of campaigning dealing with all these complicated national and international issues debating obamas running mate joe biden and having every word scrutinized by an aggressive press corps
9350143 her record as a reformer and maverick is very helpful but how can she prep on so many national and international issues she hurts the ticket because now the experience argument is weaker
9350144 the transcendent issues the most important issues of our day
9350145 only an a hole would put together a budget like this i wouldnt call you an a hole unless you really were an a hole
9350146 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9350147 if nobody wants to talks with us on these issues and cooperation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourself
9350148 our hope is that at minimum each branch will come up with a standard way of getting information
9350149 if that doesnt work well consider bringing a suit in federal court
9350150 by refusing to provide reasonable and proper notice of such proceedings through timely objective and detailed court dockets the military justice system has severely undercut a foundational tenet of american democracy
9350151 oftentimes reporters and the public have trouble just finding out about a case and when and if a trial is going on
9350152 there have been too many instances of courts martial going on behind closed doors
9350153 it is just as much of a right for the public as the accused if the courts and their proceedings are always open the people who run them are going to be more inclined to follow the rules
9350154 you dont hire the goodyear blimp to talk about how many people you have court martialed
9350155 but transparency is part of running an armed force in a democratic society committed to the rule of law
9350156 it all depends on how the public reacts to the suskind story if enough people react it remains our america not his this accusation alone handled properly by bush bashers could prove to be his tipping point if bush is to be a uniter one last time this may be his chance to be universally despised
9350157 after i was released i was afraid to stay alone in the dark i dont know why when i enter into a dark room i get frightened i immediately switch on the light and run away
9350158 my son was held for seven days before they released him
9350159 they locked him in a shed all by himself with rats in the darkness before he was kidnapped he was never afraid but after that he became terrified of the dark he goes to bed very late at night and he can only sleep after exhausting himself he insists on burying his head under my arm to feel safe when he sleeps
9350160 especially in children especially in the female any psychological problem is a stigma
9350161 they deny the disease but when we examine the child we discover many problems
9350162 i think the government is concern ed about the security and other issues but of course you have a big problems of our children
9350163 i didnt see any child psychiatry center outside iraq we told the ministry we told the government they say they have no money for the training
9350164 we still dont have enough time to see all the conditions admitted to this hospital
9350165 therefore we really need to open a whole ward we will open special classrooms for children with psychological disorders at schools and there will be intensive programs
9350166 thank god after those sessions there has been some improvement in his condition
9350167 presents the opportunity to recognize and enforce rights that are at least as basic and essential to human autonomy the right to worship and the right not to be tortured
9350168 all four petitioners were held and interrogated under appalling conditions in afghanistan by the united states before they were transported to guantanamo where they were systemically tortured and abused pursuant to directives from respondent rumsfeld and the military chain of command

9350394 the town impressed me as being much larger once i was within its limits than it had appeared from the prominence just outside i saw that the general hilliness of the surrounding countryside was also an internal feature of mirocaw here though the effect was different the parts of the town did not look as if they adhered very well to one another this condition might be blamed on the irregular topography of the town behind some of the old stores in the business district steeply roofed houses had been erected on a sudden incline their peaks appearing at an extraordinary elevation above the lower buildings and because the foundations of these houses could not be glimpsed they conveyed the illusion of being either precariously suspended in air threatening to topple down or else constructed with an unnatural loftiness in relation to their width and mass this situation also created a weird distortion of perspective the two levels of structures overlapped each other without giving a sense of depth so that the houses because of their higher elevation and nearness to the foreground buildings did not appear diminished in size as background objects should consequently a look of flatness as in a photograph predominated in this area indeed mirocaw could be compared to an album of old snapshots particularly ones in which the camera had been upset in the process of photography causing the pictures to develop on an angle a cone roofed turret like a pointed hat jauntily askew peeked over the houses on a neighboring street a billboard displaying a group of grinning vegetables tipped its contents slightly westward cars parked along steep curbs seemed to be flying skyward in the glare distorted windows of a five and ten people leaned lethargically as they trod up and down sidewalks and on that sunny day the clock tower which at first i mistook for a church steeple cast a long shadow that seemed to extend an impossible distance and wander into unlikely places in its progress across the town

9350468 ive been impressed with casey on how much his technique has improved and how coachable he is i think thats the greatest thing about him he tries to listen to exactly what you say and then he tries to do it the next time
9350469 people are saying it will be a different tim and not running im not sure where that is coming from
9350470 we have very functional running backs right now however we are still going to do what we are going to do and tim tebow is still tim the most important thing is finding a way to win that game if that means tim running that is what we are going to do
9350471 jarrett has a very quick release and throws above the rush and the pass hes work hard in his footwork and hes worked hard in recognizing things he throws a soft ball enabling the receivers to get yardage after the catch and he doesnt get rattled

9350477 there are no signs that the global credit crunch will end soon
9350478 the global economy is likely to be deeply affected by recessionary and inflationary pressures the us credit problems spread quickly into europe and then the rest of the world hong kong will no doubt be affected and an even worse time is coming

9350496 well because of religious groups which uses politics as a tool to achieve their goals of blocking the research
9350497 it was great to come in and play in the first win of the season and hopefully i can help push clyde up the table now

9350503 a screening study in 2002 included an assessment of the types of projects and activities most urgently needed by indigenous peoples
9350504 42 indigenous discussion groups were asked to list the top 5 indigenous priority needs here is the result of the bank commissioned assessment number in brackets indicates number of discussion groups who ranked the particular need among the top 5 priorities
9350505 significant negative socioeconomic impacts were identified only for one type of project road infrastructure a need prioritized by only a minority of groups as follows
9350506 the discussion groups did identify potential negative impacts associated with road projects these potential negative impacts can be listed as follows that some bad and clever outsiders may come after the road is built and exploit the assets of the village that outsiders may come and take their land that the road may lead to their forests being destroyed or degraded by sometimes armed outsiders and it will then be difficult to find forest food and forest products to sell possible land appropriation and deforestation following road construction is a major potential negative socioeconomic impact there are cases where such negative impacts particularly in terms of deforestation have occurred following road construction in forest dependent communities many forest areas have already been degraded in areas with poor road infrastructure however improved roads can accelerate that process and open new areas for exploitation by a larger number of logging interests
9350507 the small scale activities chosen by villagers and funded through rilgp will not affect land tenure or otherwise cause any direct adverse impacts

9350529 i was following an 18 year old lady on the northern beaches when the vehicle for no reason crossed to the wrong side of the road and collided head on with a truck
9350530 she was killed instantly and we believe at the time she was using a mobile phone to text or talk to somebody
9350531 it only takes that one moment of lack of concentration
9350532 there is evidence to say it is just as bad as drink driving
9350533 it was tangled in nets and they werent around its fluke or fin so we think it has probably managed to free itself
9350534 we are fairly confident of a happy ending this time
9350535 we are regularly seeing rescuers have to risk their lives to try and cut whales free from shark nets
9350536 it is a major catastrophe for the whales it puts the rescuers in danger and unless there is a rescue team in the vicinity the whales undergo a slow and agonising death
9350537 its taken 42 years to get these citations and now we have to pay for them the next of kin of dead veterans have to pay for it as well
9350538 its an issue of principle and that was the correct process
9350539 it wouldve only cost the government 1000 and they couldve done it
9350540 wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9350541 it is hard enough having to go back to work without people saying i am torturing my child to pay for the food to feed him
9350542 i might put that book away and not let finn read it
9350543 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9350544 i disagree with mem fox people have children because they want them and some people have to go back to work
9350545 there is no definitive answer but provided the child is able to have a good connection with its parents if it goes to childcare at a relatively young age that might not give it any harm
9350546 wonder how we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9350547 the government is acting in bad faith government policy is that anything additional to the 2 5 per cent must come from employee related productivity
9350548 this would mean trade offs including a loss of conditions or increased workload

9350602 to celebrate the cultural diversity of muslims all over the world we plan to have a virtual arabic and islamic attire fashion show
9350603 this will probably take place in the second half of the holy month but it will be a very special event
9350604 we have so many surprises planned for ramadan this year and we want to make it very special to all our visitors
9350605 there will be constant announcements everyday with all the events taking place so people will not miss anything

9350611 yes we must provide more ladders to success for young men who fall into lives of crime and despair but we must also admit that programs alone cant replace parents that government cant turn off the television and make a child do her homework that fathers must take more responsibility to provide love and guidance to their children individual responsibility and mutual responsibility thats the essence of americas promise and just as we keep our promise to the next generation here at home so must we keep americas promise abroad

9350627 any kind of involvement with hollywood is a waste of my time and there is no amount of money that can compensate for that i think the industry is an embarrassment on all sorts of levels but sure there are bad comics bad books and bad culture so its not just films that produce an overwhelming majority of unwatchable rubbish but films that are unwatchable rubbish cost 100 million that is the budget of an emerging third world nation which is the point where it goes from being merely tasteless to being kind of evil
9350628 the most bizarre things on television are strange reality shows that are spinoffs of other strange reality shows the most popular trend is putting a bunch of washed up b level celebrities in a house and having them fight for our amusement but sometimes one or more of these celebrities will be popular enough to merit a spinoff there was a show where it was a bunch of has beens competing to become the best country musician from that cast maureen mccormick who played marsha brady carnie wilson and bobby brown were the most popular cast members and they then got a spinoff show where theyre running their own hotel called outsiders inn its like something i dreamt except my dreams arent that strange
9350629 well i was looking at the ones you have over there theyre way too low spec for my liking i need a minimum 3gb of ram

9350730 when the water of regeneration cleansed the impurity of my former life a light from on high shone into my heart and the spirit transformed me into a new man by a second birth then at once in a miraculous manner certainty replaced doubt mysteries were revealed and darkness became light then it was possible to acknowledge that what was born of the flesh and lived for sin was earthly but what the holy spirit had vivified began to be of god in god and from god is all our strength through him we while living upon the earth have a hint of future bliss
9350731 love is the foundation of all the virtues and it continues with us eternally in the heavenly kingdom
9350732 ive been aware of some of the things out there but it was a rude blunt eye slapping experience as ive learned of how pervasive internet pornography has become the thing to me thats the most shocking is how the adult industry is targeting devices sold and marketed to youth
9350733 playboy has for years marketed content for the playstation portable that most people think is a child friendly device a lot of parents dont know kids can access the internet with them in 2005 playboy started a service called ibod it was pornography specifically tailored to the ipod it would allow individuals to download soft porn for free right on their device
9350734 when i talk to kids i never explicitly mention pornography because i dont want to introduce them to the software out there
9350735 rather i give them moral guidelines and framework on what constitutes the appropriate use of new technologies
9350736 parents think heres a great device i can give it to my kids but they have no safeguards so kids have access to all the illicit stuff on the internet or theyre taking compromising photos of themselves or others and sending them on were entering a brave new world of challenges
9350737 the amount of parental control on mobile devices that were giving to kids is either nonexistent or just now beginning to become available lets take the playstation portable that were giving to 8 year olds no parent controls the newest version of the iphone only has an on off switch for parental controls but the off switch defeats the whole purpose because then you turn off the whole internet
9350738 the consistent reaction is their jaws drop and their eyes pop because they had no idea what potential power they had given their kids through these seemingly innocent devices
9350739 the two biggest challenges i face are parental ignorance and the technology gap between parents and kids im trying to empower parents with information so they can make better decisions and open up dialogue between them and their children
9350740 were naive if we think were going to stop it
9350741 these devices amplify human nature and character and they are able to do that on a much more powerful stage than ever before
9350742 so if an eighth grader goes into the girls locker room and takes a picture of girls changing with one click he can send it anywhere its a powerful danger
9350743 parents are the answer parents community and in our case church banding together as a cohesive front
9350744 this is because i have always been in opposition even when i was in power
9350745 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them

9350782 a rod deserves all the criticism he gets he is a cancer to this team honestly does anyone actually like him
9350783 i hated striking out but i always tried to kill the ball i wanted to make it explode
9350784 you lost me when you put jeter in your list jeter is the first one to tell you that hes not a hr hitter he may try to pull outside pitches on occasion he is more likely to try and hit them to rf but its not because hes trying to hit a hr
9350785 also saying most players in mlb would kill for alexs numbers is irrelevant

9350917 once you form a government forget about talks it is a disaster and an act of insanity to think that mugabe can go it alone
9350918 the army does not want mugabe to go because they have committed a lot of crimes in the past years and they do not want to be judged for them

9350972 the palisade is an open structure which would not have been defensive and was too high to be practical for controlling livestock
9350973 it certainly wasnt for hunting herded animals and so like everything else in this ceremonial landscape we have to believe it must have had a religious significance
9350974 the most plausible explanation is that it was built at huge cost to the community to screen the environs of stonehenge from view basically we think it was to keep the lower classes from seeing what exactly their rulers and the priestly class were doing
9350975 this is a fantastic insight into what the landscape would have looked like
9350976 this huge wooden palisade would have snaked across the landscape blotting out views to stonehenge from one side
9350977 the other side was the ceremonial route to the henge from the river avon and would have been shielded by the contours

9350992 i feel too sad about what has happened to continue working on midnight sun and so it is on hold indefinitely
9350993 i have a good idea of how the leak happened as there were very few copies of midnight sun that left my possession and each was unique the manuscript that was illegally distributed on the internet was given to trusted individuals for a good purpose i have no comment beyond that as i believe that there was no malicious intent with the initial distribution
9350994 i did not want my readers to experience midnight sun before it was completed edited and published i think it is important for everybody to understand that what happened was a huge violation of my rights as an author not to mention me as a human being unfortunately with the internet it is easy for people to obtain and share items that do not legally belong to them no matter how this is done it is still dishonest

9351002 we are facing a profound economic downturn along with every other country in the world
9351003 the difference is between us and previous governments other parties is that we are taking action to help people whether it is rescuing northern rock or whether it is helping people to get back into work as they lose their jobs or tax rebates which are due at the end of next month
9351004 all my colleagues the prime minister every single one of us are focused on one single thing that is helping people helping the economy go through what is a very difficult time
9351005 i think it is important i tell people in this country that we along with every other country in the world face a unique set of circumstances where youve got the credit crunch coming at the same time with high oil and food prices
9351006 who is telling the truth at the top of government
9351007 the prime minister says the economic situation isnt as bad people think and that britain is well placed to weather the economic storm but the chancellor says we are at a 60 year low
9351008 its not clear whether alistair darling meant to tell us the truth about the mess 10 years of a labour government has left our economy in but he has certainly let the cat out of the bag
9351009 until very recently there was no problem there was a state of denial britain was the strongest country in the western world any problems we had were from overseas

9351104 la pubblicazione di intercettazioni telefoniche riguardanti romano prodi a cui va la mia assoluta solidariet non che lennesima ripetizione di un copione gi visto e grave che ci accada e il parlamento deve sollecitamente intervenire per evitare il perpetuarsi di tali abusi che tanto profondamente incidono sulla vita dei cittadini e sulle libert fondamentali

9351112 proprio per questo dice cesa teniamo una posizione distinta dal partito democratico evitando di sovrapporre la collaborazione istituzionale tra le forze dellopposizione con lintese politiche che non ci sono

9351120 in queste ultime settimane ha detto ratzinger al termine della recita dell angelus dal palazzo apostolico di castel gandolfo la cronaca ha registrato laumento degli episodi di immigrazione irregolare dallafrica
9351121 non di rado la traversata del mediterraneo verso il continente europeo visto come un approdo di speranza per sfuggire a situazioni avverse e spesso insostenibili si trasforma in tragedia quella avvenuta qualche giorno ha aggiunto il papa ricordando i recenti casi di sbarco di clandestini che hanno prodotto numerosi morti fa sembra aver superato le precedenti per lalto numero di vittime la migrazione fenomeno presente fin dagli albori della storia dellumanit che da sempre pertanto ha caratterizzato le relazioni tra popoli e nazioni
9351122 lemergenza in cui si trasformata nei nostri tempi tuttavia ci interpella e mentre sollecita la nostra solidariet impone nello stesso tempo efficaci risposte politiche so che molte istanze regionali nazionali e internazionali si stanno occupando della questione della migrazione irregolare ad esse va il mio plauso e il mio incoraggiamento affinch continuino la loro meritevole azione con senso di responsabilit e spirito umanitario
9351123 senso di responsabilit devono mostrare anche i paesi di origine non solo perch si tratta di loro concittadini ha aggiunto benedetto xvi ma anche per rimuovere le cause di migrazione irregolare come pure per stroncare alle radici tutte le forme di criminalit ad essa collegate dal canto loro i paesi europei e comunque quelli meta di immigrazione sono tra laltro chiamati a sviluppare di comune accordo iniziative e strutture sempre pi adeguate alle necessit dei migranti irregolari questi ultimi poi vanno pure sensibilizzati sul valore della propria vita che rappresenta un bene unico sempre prezioso da tutelare di fronte ai gravissimi rischi a cui si espongono nella ricerca di un miglioramento delle loro condizioni e sul dovere della legalit che si impone a tutti
9351124 come padre comune sento il profondo dovere di richiamare lattenzione di tutti sul problema e di chiedere la generosa collaborazione di singoli e di istituzioni per affrontarlo e trovare vie di soluzione il signore ha concluso benedetto xvi ci accompagni e renda fecondi i nostri sforzi

9351135 marted scorso sono venuto ad arezzo con lunica premura di aver invitato tutti i membri del comitato provinciale uscente per ringraziarli del lavoro svolto durante le elezioni ai presenti ho illustrato il programma dibattuto nellultima direzione nazionale udc
9351136 la linea politica del partito prosegue quella del segretario cesa e di pier ferdinando casini che ci pone alternativi alla sinistra e non annessi al pdl sicuri di esser la spina dorsale del partito popolare europeo in italia il mio compito come commissario quello di far funzionare il partito a livello locale affinch gli organi dinformazione possano porre lattenzione su di unazione politica importante senza dar adito a polemiche strumentali che interessano solo chi le alimenta
9351137 in tal senso spiega abbiamo gi attivato nelle maggiori citt della provincia lapertura dei gazebo per la raccolta delle firme per la reintroduzione del voto di preferenza nella legge elettorale avremo poi la festa nazionale di chianciano terme 11 14 settembre p v che ci vedr protagonisti vista la vicinanza geografica dopodich avvieremo una seria verifica con gli iscritti al fine di giungere alle scadenze elettorali 2009 con una definita compagine politico amministrativa
9351138 non possiamo dunque accettare che qualcuno parli sin dora di alleanze con chicchessia chiarisce pur senza dimenticare che la nostra storia ci vede da sempre in provincia di arezzo alternativi alla sinistra in qualsivoglia amministrazione
9351139 ludc valuta positivamente le aperture che ci vengono a livello locale e regionale dagli esponenti del centro destra ma al di l di quelle non vi sono stati ancora incontri ufficiali giudico prematuro e fuorviante parlare di alleanze politiche in questo momento chi ha voglia di impegnarsi nelludc ha la possibilit di farlo sia nel partito sia nelle amministrazioni locali alla ricerca del bene comune e dellinteresse generale

9351147 quant sabstenir de voter pour chirac en 2002 cest oublier ce que pouvait repr senter un signal fort destination des populations directement vis es par les discours de le pen dont les homos et den arriver justement une lection de chirac contre le pen avec un chiffre mirobolant ce fut le cas et la seule r ussite de la gauche lors de cette lection je suis fier de m tre mobilis et forc voter pour chirac au second tour des lections pr sidentielles de 2002
9351148 la fiert davoir appel voter chirac et de lavoir fait
9351149 parce que la patrie en entier le faisait pour lhonneur
9351150 eh bien si on ne va pas voter au second tour parce quon estime quaucun des candidats nest bons tous ceux qui nont pas vot pour eux au premier tour doivent ils sabstenir
9351151 dans quel cas doit on aller voter au second tour alors seulement dans le cadre dun duel gauche droite
9351152 dans ce cas autant ne plus faire quun scrutin un seul tour avec un candidat du ps contre un candidat de lump
9351153 ou m me un seul tour avec plusieurs candidats mais dans lequel on saurait pertinemment que seul celui du ps ou de lump aurait une chance de lemporter
9351154 mais la mobilisation pour le vote chirac a oblit r toutes ses chances de mobilisation les lecteurs de gauche ont cru avoir fait leur devoir en votant contre lepen qui navait aucune chance de se faire lire
9351155 weve got a real competitive 10 team al only 6 6 league going
9351156 i didnt want to spoil the vibe by bringing in angie but by the day of the draft we still only had nine teams so we agreed as a league that it was really our only option worst decision ever
9351157 shes been a great addition to the league and shes going to coast into the money dont tell david i said this but if there has to be a choice well there is no choice you know what i mean
9351158 i didnt add a comment or anything i just put it out there
9351159 i know he wanted me to fire back with an equally insulting trade offer so we could have a big email war about it or something
9351160 but i am above that so i just rejected the offer and pretended like it didnt happen
9351161 in the past four weeks i think ive received 13 trade offers from david and they are all obnoxious
9351162 some of them come in the middle of the night some come in the middle of the day at work
9351163 the other day we were both on our laptops in the same room and he sent me one i think it was grady sizemore so annoying
9351164 can i help it if i have a different valuation system than she does i mean the bottom line is that a team in my position has different needs than a team in her position so you have to look at it from my perspective
9351165 yes a ninth place team certain does have different needs than a team that is in second
9351166 david is correct about that what he is not correct about is his childish behavior im about sick of it and im thinking about taking extreme action
9351167 so stupid but i feel like if i can just hold off until then then itll all blow over and we can go back to normal
9351168 even after the trade deadline you can still propose trades they just cant be processed so i can keep this going until the end of the year angie is really going to regret the way shes acted toward me
9351169 if you do not tell the truth about yourself you cannot tell it about other people
9351170 i was at this nightclub i was like wicked trashed and shit and this girl comes out of nowhere and starts rubbing against me on the dance floor and before i knew it we were locking lips and then just like that she was gone
9351171 i always thought he was a little off but one time i was telling a story about how i was railing this chick and paps was like ewww then the ugly truth came out
9351172 it wouldve turned us into the laughingstock of the league if it was revealed our closer had never even come close to reaching second base let alone getting laid
9351173 i mean hes great but there are a lot of things not quite in order up in his attic you know he could probably get any chick in new england but he has the sexual maturity of an eight year old
9351174 estimates that less than half of iraqis get drinking water piped into their homes in rural areas in the capital people set their alarm clocks to wake them in the middle of the night so they can fill storage tanks when water pressure is under less strain

9351193 s al voto di preferenza il giovanile motore del partito
9351194 si propone come motore del partito sul territorio giovani e giovanissimi mettono a disposizione il proprio tempo libero perch credono che questa iniziativa proposta da casini in prima persona possa rafforzare la nostra democrazia in quanto pi autorevole il parlamentare eletto a seguito del voto di preferenza di migliaia di cittadini piuttosto che il parlamentare nominato insindacabile dalle segreterie di partito ridotto troppo spesso di conseguenza al ruolo di yes man
9351195 i gazebo per la raccolta delle firme saranno solo il primo impulso per rodare la macchina del gruppo giovani e raccogliere le prime impressioni delle persone illustrando nel contempo le linee guida del nostro partito che vede giorno dopo giorno premiare la coraggiosa scelta identitaria dello scorso aprile
9351196 del resto aggiunge piersante morandini coordinatore nazionale a margine dellassemblea tenuta in data 25 agosto con i giovani di arezzo lentusiasmo di arezzo contagiante non un caso che proprio ai ragazzi di arezzo richiesto uno sforzo notevole per dare il benvenuto ai giovani di tutta italia alla festa nazionale dellunione di centro che si terr a chianciano terme si dall11 al 14 settembre
9351197 il presidente pierfendinando casini sa di poter trovare nei giovani una locomotiva di entusiasmo e grinta per rinnovare dal basso questa nostra italia
9351198 non certamente casuale la citt sta divenendo sempre pi il capoluogo di tendenza della valdichiana oltre ai numerosi vip che la rendono trendy la citt sta diventando un must anche per i politici italiani indipendentemente dallo schieramento politico naturale quindi che i giovani abbiano scelto una localit cool per mettersi alla prova in vista dellimpegno che li vedr protagonisti a chianciano

9351204 we got the victory and thats a great thing for georgia
9351205 if you had told me before the game what the outcome would be regardless of what the score would be i would have taken it i was pleased with the victory i am happy to win even though we made some mistakes but there were a lot of good things that happened too as coaches when things dont go the way we want we get bent out of shape but the victory is good well correct the mistakes and hopefully do a better job next week
9351206 we knew that once we scored once the flood gates would open
9351207 josh came in and made some plays for us tonight when we needed them hes a young kid who can make things happen and he gave us a big boost when we needed it
9351208 the defense did a great job of keeping us in the ball game in the first half especially when we turned it over
9351209 those guys had a tremendous week of preparation and it showed tonight
9351210 but weve got a big week ahead of us so were going to go right back to work tomorrow to get ready for next saturday
9351211 we had our last controlled scrimmage before the ballgame like weve always done on friday night of course the thing were trying to do is see are we ready to play a game are the substitutions coming in right does the kicking team know when to go on the field are they sitting in the right place where we can find them and things like that we did a pretty good job on that

9351215 no one in my office has any idea about her and the only comment im hearing which is not good is that shes a woman and thats why she was picked

9351256 i think obamas going to make an intensely political choice not a governing choice hes going to view this through the prism of a candidate not through the prism of president that is to say hes going to pick somebody that he thinks will on the margin help him in a state like indiana or missouri or virginia hes not going to be thinking big and broad about the responsibilities of president with all due respect again to governor kaine hes been a governor for three years hes been able but undistinguished i dont think people could really name a big important thing that hes done he was mayor of the 105th largest city in america

9351279 im trying to throw as hard as i can and you see the gun 91 88 mph everybody goes through these and i just have to wait for my arm strength and my arm power to come back so i can do a good job for my team
9351280 i think this is the time when you have close to 180 innings you have to save your bullets you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm
9351281 i didnt throw side sessions friday or the day before i just played long catch and i think it worked for me
9351282 i dont feel any pain in my arm at all
9351283 if i felt pain id tell them i dont want to pitch through pain like i did in tampa bay on june 16 they knew it i knew it i said at that time i cant throw like this and i needed a little rest and everything worked better its just a dead arm now
9351284 unfortunately i think i made a bad decision of trying to play through some inflammation in my knee and it has cost me and cost the team a couple of games

9351294 a number of the hospitals that originally planned to shelter in place have now decided they are going to actually try to evacuate their critically ill and medical needs patients
9351295 as a consequence weve had to increase the tempo of our air flights into new orleans in order to make sure that we can accommodate the flow were going to be watching this very carefully today
9351296 russia does not want confrontation with any country russia does not plan to isolate itself russia will develop as far as possible its relations with europe with the united states of america and with other countries
9351297 everyone should understand that if someone launches an aggressive sortie he will receive a response
9351298 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9351299 thus europe would only be hurting itself if we were to get full of emotion and slam all the doors shut to the rooms that we will want to enter afterwards
9351300 whatever people say right is on our side we conducted ourselves absolutely morally and in line with international law
9351301 the leaders discussed the importance of supporting georgias territorial integrity and the need for russia to comply with all elements of the ceasefire agreement and withdraw its troops from georgia
9351302 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9351303 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9351304 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9351305 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9351306 when you see one of the best backs in the country laying there in pain its definitely something that you dont want to see
9351307 beanies a tough guy i know were all pulling for him hes gone to the doctors and hell do whatever he can to help this team out

9351310 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9351311 putting the country first is the right thing to do
9351312 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9351313 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9351314 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9351315 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9351316 but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities this could be a a much worse storm hopefully it wont be but the possibilities are definitely there
9351317 we will only be able to tell the extent after the water recedes
9351318 the government has taken over all boats in the area
9351319 the situation is definitely bad but now the army has joined in and rescue operations will be speeded up
9351320 people have been trapped for days living on the roofs of the concrete buildings in the villages while mud and thatch huts were swept away
9351321 cuanto mas conozco a los hombres mas me gustan los gatos
9351322 there is no need to change the capital structure in ongc videsh despite its large takeover bid for imperial the entire funding will be provided as loan to them
9351323 we have already provided financial support to ongc videsh to the tune of rs 12 000 13 000 crore in the past as loan
9351324 we are a cash rich company and funding is not a problem ongc has reserves of about us 4 3 bn and out which cash of us 2 bn
9351325 we will go for us 1 bn bridge funding and rest usd 1 8 billion would be from internal resources
9351326 the 45 days from the bid are very crucial i am deliberately not speaking much on details as it may create problems if everything runs smoothly we expect to crystallise the deal in the next 45 days
9351327 ello incluye programas como la repatriaci n de cad veres asistencia jur dica a condenados a muerte apoyo legal a mexicanos detenidos en c rceles de estados unidos y asistencia laboral a indocumentados
9351328 para transitar hacia una modalidad mixta que permita tanto el voto postal como tambi n el electr nico
9351329 trabajos de perforaci n vertical y direccional para pozos petroleros en la regi n norte
9351330 una vez concluida la evaluaci n de las propuestas se adjudic el contrato respectivo a la empresa krc grupo petrolero de m xico s de r l por un monto de dos millones 268 mil 753 13 pesos mexicanos m s 40 millones 65 mil d lares americanos
9351331 el gobierno de nuevo le n se compromete a recoger con seriedad los pronunciamientos y propuestas de la sociedad civil y tambi n a compartir con ella los esfuerzos que realizamos en materia de combate a la delincuencia
9351332 nuestra sociedad de manera pac fica y participativa ha expresado de forma aut ntica su sentir y percepci n sobre el cr tico problema de seguridad el gobierno de nuevo le n hace suyos sus reclamos y demandas ciudadanas
9351333 el fen meno de crecimiento s bito de la de inseguridad que padecemos los mexicanos
9351334 en esta batalla se han perdido vidas humanas elementos valiosos de nuestras fuerzas armadas de las corporaciones federales de las corporaciones estatales y municipales y desafortunadamente tambi n se han ido contaminando las instituciones
9351335 esta situaci n atenta incluso contra la gobernabilidad de la naci n y de nuestras entidades federativas conscientes de esta grave crisis y frente a la acechanza del crimen organizado y frente a acciones que da an y otras que quieren atemorizarnos la mejor acci n es el trabajo conjunto
9351336 hoy m s que nunca la suma de esfuerzos de la sociedad y la autoridad en todos sus niveles nos permitir recuperar al nuevo le n y al m xico que todos anhelamos
9351337 vamos a impulsar las gestiones y reformas necesarias para que la secretar a de comunicaciones y transportes sct y la comisi n federal de telecomunicaciones cofetel otorguen una frecuencia de se al abierta a este importante medio de comunicaci n
9351338 incluso se plantea que el canal del poder judicial tambi n pueda transmitir en se al abierta ya sea en la misma o en otra frecuencia ya que si se busca un equilibrio de poderes y una verdadera apertura en la informaci n debe otorgarse esta frecuencia
9351339 el canal ya tiene ocho a os de experiencia y es tiempo de dar un paso fundamental a su profesionalizaci n reforzar su imagen y que es un medio p blico de mayor presencia y calidad
9351340 como una forma de blindar nuestro crecimiento econ mico el gasto p blico debe privilegiar el desarrollo de infraestructura lo que permitir generar empleos en el corto plazo y a largo plazo esto atraer inversiones
9351341 no hay ning n pa s que pueda aspirar al crecimiento econ mico si antes no se garantizan estos dos rubros
9351342 los ciudadanos podr n ver m s polic as en las calles pero si esto no se traduce en una percepci n de mayor seguridad junto con una reducci n de los ndices de delitos del fuero com n y federal los esfuerzos ser n en vano
9351343 i do not know what i may appear to the world i seem to have been only playing on the seashore and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or prettier shell than ordinary whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me
9351344 our system is what you call a strong mayor form of government
9351345 the advantage is that it is a lot easier to get programs implemented as it offers total control of service delivery and the management of government its good but requires different levels of accountability
9351346 we were once a three commissioner system and there was absolutely no diversity in city government i am the first african american mayor this city has ever elected
9351347 the lawsuit was brought about because no african american could get elected here it was impossible to be represented by government
9351348 they have no connection to administration its a misdemeanor for them to direct any city employee
9351349 he can directly hire and promote employees he is in there long enough to be strategic and to develop goals that makes it possible to treat business like a business
9351350 i found city employees could deliver the same service and support that private industry delivers and that city employees could do it cheaper we went to one person garbage trucks during my term and we were able to save 1 2 million and 70 employees
9351351 how in the hell can i be strategic with that kind of zoo
9351352 no one was in charge long enough to make it happen it was a mess
9351353 to do things right you need a full time executive you cant have someone choking up or someone who is controlling everything too much you need someone in charge of each section
9351354 for one you have got to have trust in relationships be trustworthy and build trust build relationships
9351355 we have to get beyond partisan divides and things like demographics that we think define government look at national government being a democrat or a republican is more important than getting the job done and that saddens me a great deal
9351356 it is all in the works the new bypass will be at least 180 feet high
9351357 were the number one city for economic growth and expansion the one key is globalization major companies and international companies have an interest in us because of the port of mobile
9351358 it was cotton that made mobile a major seaport and commercial center before the civil war
9351359 one of the things that has been really positive for this community is that we do everything in partnerships we work in concert with one another to achieve economic development
9351360 it is what is so unique about the state of alabama
9351361 our area is appealing to people who move from other areas because of the hospitality the location and the other activities that take place the atmosphere and climate of the community has been one of our strongest selling points
9351362 hmmmmm makes sense but how come i never heard of this woman and her pregnancy while acting as governor before this
9351363 since 1921 or whatever if they really have been making it continuously since then or that it was made for a decade or so and then restarted last year or whatever
9351364 handcrafted since 1921 which does not rule out some lapses in that time but merely that it was never machine crafted or foot crafted for that matter

9351373 working group of representatives from each of the states in hurricane gustavs path the group will ensure that all affected delegates have information and assistance in real time
9351374 we all know the truth gustav is just a plot by the obama campaign to make the republicans look bad while they party at their convention thats how evil the democrats are risking an american city and the lives of americans to score political points so in november vote mccain palin they hate hurricanes

9351405 i am a big fan of this middle east e gaming development paper it lays out the ground work for exceptional progress and investment in this sector personally im going to invest my own funds in project development
9351406 i never thought that middle east e gaming development would come this far i knew that investments from private individuals would surely come but from the major investment houses no way
9351407 time especialy when it comes to middle east e gaming development is of the essence we dont have time to mess around and blow our chances at what could be a fantastic opportunity
9351408 we find this paper about middle east e gaming development from brzezinski miltner to be a strong testament to our industrys growth and potential it clearly outshines the detractors and any negative points
9351409 i dont want to ruin the parade but somme humility and financial restraint in a sector dominated by middle east e gaming development firms would go a long way

9351481 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
9351482 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
9351483 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
9351484 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
9351485 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
9351486 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
9351487 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
9351488 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
9351489 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
9351490 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
9351491 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
9351492 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
9351493 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
9351494 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
9351495 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
9351496 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
9351497 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
9351498 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
9351499 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
9351500 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
9351501 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
9351502 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
9351503 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
9351504 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
9351505 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
9351506 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
9351507 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
9351508 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention

9351541 i should have taken it straightened up and then threw it
9351542 people always watch the bad things i dont want to make an error i would like to be perfect and be the best guy out there but im human and im going to make mistakes
9351543 its interesting when he looks really smooth people dont consider him nonchalant
9351544 when he makes a play like that all of a sudden hes nonchalant i look at robbie alomar robbie alomar had a smoothness to him when he played some guys are gifted with that
9351545 the key is making sure you get the one out
9351546 to me he got his feet tangled up a little bit and thats why he made a bad throw
9351547 thats the same way that i played in the minor leagues
9351548 its not that i want to be like that you see im getting here early every day and i work hard its not like im going to work hard and then be smooth thats the way i play
9351549 beltre stopped put his hand up and intentionally hit the baseball
9351550 if thats the case its an automatic double play and thats what it should have been
9351551 in this case the argument is you can assume the double play
9351552 hes going to go from here and we may not pitch him much until they elect him to the hall of fame
9351553 sometimes thats a tougher situation for a pitcher to pitch and hold the lead especially with two outs in a save situation
9351554 i was very happy that he was poised and got the job done
9351555 i try to just come in and pound the strike zone
9351556 i make hitters get themselves out i pitch to contact instead of away from contact

9351608 por fin tras su debate en el senado el congreso de diputados aprob ayer la ley del suelo que entrar en vigor dentro de pocos d as la tramitaci n del proyecto ha sido especialmente laboriosa ya que el gobierno tuvo que adaptar el texto a una sentencia del tribunal constitucional que en marzo del a o pasado invalid m s de 200 art culos de la anterior ley una norma refundida de 1992 el r gimen del suelo durante la etapa socialista estaba sometido a una estricta regulaci n administrativa en la que se establec a el n mero de metros cuadrados que se pod a edificar en funci n de la demanda previsible suelo urbanizable programado la nueva ley simplifica los tipos de suelo y los reduce a tres urbano urbanizable y no urbanizable salvo que est expresamente prohibido por una disposici n jur dica todo suelo es a partir de ahora urbanizable y lo es mediante un procedimiento administrativo que agiliza notablemente el actual sistema de licencias y permisos el gobierno espera conseguir con ello un dr stico aumento de la oferta de suelo lo que seg n asegur ayer el ministro arias salgado se deber a traducir a medio plazo en una reducci n del precio del suelo y por tanto de la vivienda teng se en cuenta que el suelo representa ahora m s del 40 del coste de una vivienda una cifra que se ha duplicado desde 1982 el a o en que llegaron al poder los socialistas la nueva ley reduce adem s del 15 a un m ximo del 10 el coeficiente de cesi n obligatoria de los promotores privados a los ayuntamientos la federaci n espa ola de municipios hab a pedido al gobierno que no se rebajara este porcentaje ya que los ayuntamientos obtienen importantes ingresos de l con buen criterio la nueva ley lo disminuye ya que no parece l gico que las corporaciones municipales hagan negocio de la construcci n de viviendas el texto aprobado siguiendo la doctrina establecida por el constitucional cede a las comunidades aut nomas lascompetencias en materia de planificaci n del suelo y ordenaci n urban stica el estado se reserva el reg men jur dico de la propiedad el de valoraci n y las expropiaciones de inter s p blico la oposici n de izquierdas psoe e iu no ha acogido con entusiasmo la nueva ley del suelo que seg n su parecer podr a favorecer la especulaci n inmobiliaria tal vez existe ese riesgo pero de lo que no hay duda es de que el vigente r gimen de filosof a intervencionista ha provocado durante los ltimos 10 a os un astron mico incremento del precio del terreno para edificar cuando la posibilidad de construir una urbanizaci n depende de una licencia municipal arbitraria o de una recalificaci n de terrenos hay serias posibilidades de corrupci n a lo largo del proceso simplificar y hacer m s transparente el uso del suelo no es ning n desprop sito aunque se echa en falta en la ley una apuesta por la figura del promotor de suelo urbanizable habr que dar tiempo al tiempo hasta que esta iniciativa pueda dar sus frutos s lo entonces podremos hacer un juicio definitivo

9351635 han sido enteramente venezolanas ah hay 400 horas de televisi n que no hablaban precisamente de los nativos de texas o de arizona hablan de la gente de caricuao o de la bombilla de petare y de la precariedad que signa su vida
9351636 las telenovelas son entretenimiento cabrujas lo dijo mejor que nadie la telenovela es el show del sentimiento cuentan historias de amor contrariado en mis telenovelas yo he hablado de violencia dom stica de maternidad precoz de paternidad irresponsable expl came si ah estoy inculcando valores capitalistas
9351637 una telenovela es una historia de amor la nica nica que se hizo con un sesgo editorial distinto y no era para nada capitalista fue por estas calles del resto la calle del medio de una telenovela siempre es una historia de amor y m s bien son historias moralizantes porque en ellas los buenos se premian y la maldad siempre se paga
9351638 en ning n momento he pensado hacer una novela capitalista o una novela socialista yo s lo pienso en hacer una novela entretenida y que tenga un mensaje positivo la lucha por mantener la familia unida el perd n la reconciliaci n y la superaci n personal son los temas que a m particularmente me gusta tocar en las telenovelas
9351639 no me explico de donde saca l ch vez eso debe ser que no ve las telenovelas es una contradicci n decir que las telenovelas envenenan puesto que tves siendo una televisora social las produce y las transmite

9351855 bagaimanapun juga seperti banyak kita lihat sebelumnya jika kita dalam kondisi yang baik khususnya saat balapan kita tidak lebih lambat darinya kecuali dua atau tiga kali saya lebih banyak finis didepan daripada dia
9351856 jadi mungkin dia memaksa terlalu keras dan kehilangan grip ban depannya hari ini permukaanya sedikit lebih licin di tikungan saya juga mendapat beberapa peringatan
9351857 casey terlalu banyak memaksa tapi dia tidak dapat menjauh dariku
9351858 di beberapa lap saya bertambah beberapa lainnya saya kehilangan ini lomba yang panjang dan saya tidak tahu apakah saya dapat menangkapnya tapi bagaimanapun saya senang sebab settinganku baik dan ketika saya melihatnya tergelincir saya pikir ini baik bagi kami untuk perebutan kejuaraan
9351859 saya merasa grogi sebelum balap sebab disini di misano teman temanku ada semua seluruh keluargaku juga hanya anjingku saja yang tidak datang
9351860 jadi sangat sulit untuk berkonsentrasi ada banyak tekanan dibelakangku selalu positif tapi saya merasa sedikit grogi sebab dalam sesi latihan kami berusaha keras dengan settingan juga tahun lalu sangat buruk mesinnya rusak setelah tiga lap
9351861 saya berjanji padanya saya tidak akan mencapai rekor yang lainnya sebab 122 kemenangan atau 123 seperti katanya adalah berat dan begitu pula dengan 15 titel
9351862 dite che non odiate gli ebrei e che siete solo antisionisti
9351863 dead woman being carried by the georgian soldiers from the town of gori
9351864 personally witnessed ossetian militias looting and burning down ethnic georgian villages
9351865 a lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes
9351866 the images strongly indicate that the majority of the destruction in five of the villages tamarasheni kekhvi kvemo achabeti zemo achabeti and kurta was caused by intentional burning
9351867 the expert analysis indicates clear patterns of destruction that are consistent with the evidence gathered by human rights watch researchers working in the region
9351868 openly admitted that the houses were being burned by their associates explaining that the objective was to ensure that ethnic georgians would not have the houses to return to
9351869 all of this adds up to compelling evidence of war crimes and grave human rights abuses
9351870 this should persuade the russian government it needs to prosecute those responsible for these crimes
9351871 people including apparently some ardent catholics seem to forget how central the pro life issue is to catholic morality and why that is so we are not quibbling here about how many angels can dance on the head of a pin it is no exaggeration to say that the inviolability and sacredness of innocent human life is to catholic morality what the doctrine of the holy trinity is to catholic dogma both are not only non negotiable they are foundational i would challenge speaker pelosi to come up with any moral question on which the church has expressed itself with greater clarity than on the intrinsic evil of abortion a solid core of beliefs or principles undergirds any human organization these beliefs constitute the cement that binds the society together and determine its identity obviously plenty of issues fall outside this fundamental core and there is a difference between legitimate pluralism of opinion and arrant contradiction environmentalists for example can disagree about many things such as strategies priorities tactics funding and the like but devotion to the environment and its logical corollaries are not up for debate if you sport a mink coat youre out of the club
9351872 some people think that when catholics compare abortion to slavery or to nazi anti semitism they are engaging in hyperbole they couldnt be more wrong abortion is not only the greatest social injustice of our century it is arguably the greatest social injustice of all time
9351873 if we consider not only how extensively attacks on life are spreading but also their unheard of numerical proportion
9351874 regardless of whether its to an i pod or not you are seeing the results of the ultimate in brand awareness

9351881 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9351882 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9351883 mereka menjangka satu kecaman yang kuat terutama pada 31 ogos hari di mana semua rakyat malaysia menyambut ulang tahun kemerdekaan negara
9351884 selepas 51 tahun mencapai kemerdekaan sebarang kesangsian mengenai kesetiaan mana mana penduduk etnik malaysia dan tindakan mempersoal kewarganegaraan adalah melampaui usaha menyemai persefahaman di kalangan rakyat malaysia

9351922 evitar que se nos finquen falsas acusaciones para un despido injustificado
9351923 nadie quiere hablar porque hay mucho miedo a las represalias

9351925 rumores de que podr an llegar a los centros universitarios
9351926 vivimos no s lo una parodia por no decir tragedia de lo ocurrido hace casi 20 a os cuando el mismo padilla l pez enfrent el embate de la federaci n de estudiantes de guadalajara feg agrupaci n que m s tarde debilitar a hasta casi extinguirla para integrar la federaci n de estudiantes universitarios feu por una disputa caciquil por el poder en el interior de la universidad
9351927 lamentable que hayamos llegado al exceso de dar un verdadero golpe de estado al m s puro estilo caciquil de principios del siglo xx ante una guerra del todo por el todo y hasta donde tope por mantener bajo un dominio personal ya sea de padilla l pez o de brise o torres que deteriora y desgasta a una de las instituciones educativas m s importantes en m xico
9351928 m s tarde heredaron a sus hijos lo que gener una nueva generaci n de caciques
9351929 se avecina una cruenta cacer a de brujas para todos aquellos que no tomemos partido ya sea por carlos brise o o por el bando encabezado por el ex rector ra l padilla l pez pues el fondo del problema es la grave impunidad en que se mueven unos cuantos personajes de la instituci n quienes se dan el lujo de ponernos la bota en el cuello y definir en camarillas el destino de la universidad
9351930 hay un sentir generalizado de temor e incertidumbre pues aqu quienes estamos secuestrados somos los acad micos que trabajamos en el laboratorio o en el aula ante grupos verdaderamente porriles que se pelean entre ellos por alcanzar el poder absoluto en la udeg sin importar que a quien lesionan gravemente no son sus intereses personales sino a una de las instituciones educativas m s importantes del pa s pues vivimos un viejo sistema de cacicazgo que se remonta a 60 a os

9351950 ill just close them for a moment but ill keep listening
9351951 please pray for me to minister to my co workers
9351952 if it is a week or older people probably do not care
9351953 ensure we have up to date figures that will help us better target the help we provide for veterans in prison
9351954 if proper treatment was available for these disturbed servicemen hundreds if not thousands would not have offended
9351955 effectively when armed personnel return there is no help for them
9351956 contrasts greatly with the way the united states provide counselling and assistance to their armed personnel
9351957 i have come to the conclusion that if proper treatment was available for these disturbed servicemen hundreds if not thousands would not have offended
9351958 the government is letting them and their families down very badly indeed
9351959 as many as 8 500 former soldiers are currently in custody in the uk
9351960 there is no systematic availability of stress related counselling this should be made available without delay and would drastically reduce the number of receptions into custody
9351961 the mod works closely with the service charities to support veterans when they leave the armed forces and for those who find themselves in prison
9351962 the prison in reach initiative already provides advice on the support available to veterans before and after their release robust systems are in place to treat and prevent ptsd post traumatic stress disorder and other stress disorders
9351963 therefore unless one is willing to compromise ones beliefs by agreeing to a religious service it is impossible to be buried
9351964 there is a degree of black comedy about this and my mother who had a fantastic sense of humour would certainly have laughed
9351965 when i rang up and asked derry city councils cemeteries department if it was possible to bury an atheist in a municipal cemetery they said it was possible because there were different sections for catholics protestants and muslims
9351966 my wife asked if it meant they were going to start an atheist section and the woman said oh no she can go in with the protestants
9351967 kill him kill kill you have to kill him you understand
9351968 make themselves like a man a woman like a man the punishment is kill kill them throw them from the highest place
9351969 this is not to tell you to start killing people
9351970 there must be a muslim leader when the muslim army becomes stronger when islam has grown enough
9351971 islam is keeping away from disbelief and from the disbelievers the people who disbelieve
9351972 its part of islam of the correct belief that you love those who love allah and that you hate those who hate allah
9351973 it is not befitting for muslims that he should reside in the land of evil the land of the kuffaar the land of the disbelievers
9351974 some conditions can take you into disbelief to take the british citizenship whether you like it or not for these people you are selling your religion its a very serious thing it is not allowed to give allegiance to other than allah
9351975 what are these people doing in there these things are so vile what they say with their tongues is so vile and disgusting its an abomination
9351976 this is false it does not work this concept is a lie it is fake and it is a farce
9351977 sister if me and my husband we cant go together what do i do if i want to go
9351978 you know that working in an environment that is not islamic working with the kuffaar all this takes you away from the religion and hardens your heart and it would be lying to you if i say its ok
9351979 you see muslims in every sphere of everyday life in this country i see muslims it breaks my heart when i see them working in banks short sleeves tight scarf like this make up being with the kuffaar all the time even speaking their language
9351980 the icc the london central mosque and islamic cultural centre most commonly referred to as the regents park mosque is committed to interfaith and cross cultural understanding
9351981 it does not support or condone extreme views racial hatred violence or intolerance
9351982 whilst it is recommended for a muslim to migrate to a muslim country it is not obligatory
9351983 we are not blind followers of any government or any clerics we do criticise other religions just as other religions criticise islam we encourage integration into society
9351984 you may regard these juristic and textual rulings as extreme restrictions
9351985 but we see them as our way of life and a liberation of the soul
9351986 evil wicked mischievous people they do the most evil filthy things
9351987 their time will come like every other evil persons time will come
9351988 then people can see people without hands people can see in public heads rolling down the street people got sic their hands and feet from opposite sides chopped off and they see them crucified they see people put up against the pole and see them get lashed in public they see it and because they see it it acts as a deterrent for them because they say i dont want that to happen to me
9351989 the lecture was aimed at reforming the muslim people the muslim society and the muslim world to be adjudicated by the sovereign islamic state
9351990 we try to represent a variety of opinions through the products we sell in order to spread peace respect tolerance and understanding
9351991 despite having no control over the bookshop we met with those running the bookshop after your programme was broadcast we made it clear that it was not acceptable for the bookshop to stock materials containing extremist views we were assured all offending material had been removed
9351992 petrodollar money coming from saudi arabia has basically distorted the growth and development of the muslim community in britain
9351993 the abuse and misuse of this great faith of mine
9351994 the underlying motive here is to find a way of continuously implanting this permanent wedge between the wider british society and the younger muslims living in britain
9351995 to think as i believe our government thinks that it makes ideological sense to play patsy with the saudi government is folly of the first order of magnitude we will be paying for it for years to come
9351996 right its more than 60 metres 200ft deep so do you want to take the stairs or the lift
9351997 oh and by the way the door weighs three tonnes its made of lead and metal and it still works
9351998 will you be re opening this bunker for the new cold war
9351999 who wants that what family wants that that you could be blown up at any moment why would anyone want to go there again
9352000 but its no longer safe down here from a nuclear attack you know the bombs are too big now its not deep enough
9352001 we have new bunkers in moscow though maybe 100 metres deep i dont know
9352002 i would not want to spend the rest of my life looking out that little window knowing that when they come to get me to be executed that will be the last view outside that i ever see but i have never seen one of them break down
9352003 they know what their future holds i never ask them things because i have to be indifferent i cant get emotionally or personally involved because i have a job to do
9352004 sometimes i want to say stuff like who do you know in egypt who do you know in england but i dont i just look at the postcard and the stamps i can be a better officer if i dont delve into their personal life
9352005 i dont cross the line im here to do my job to raise my family to have a pay cheque and insurance theres too big a cost
9352006 the laughter coming out of their cells is what amazes me more than anything
9352007 they make the best of every day but theyve been here for so long those three theyre like a little family theyre close to each other
9352008 i have 41 females in my care in the rhu
9352009 im not there to make their stay harder i dont treat them like a piece of shit but if theres one that needs a wake up call they know how i roll they study me 24 7 what else do they have to do
9352010 i have my rules and if you dont like my rules i tell them when youre 18 theres the world and out you go i will feed you i will clothe you and i will give you what you need to survive until you get out the only difference is i show my children love
9352011 when you start out the hardest thing is learning not to let the inmates walk all over you not to let your buttons be pushed when i first started an inmate heard i was a single mother with a son and she would yell things i was enraged theyre very good at finding your buttons i got over it but it took me a while
9352012 you learn you can let the inmate have the last word because really in the end the guard has the last word we walk out of the gates every day they dont
9352013 it is a working relationship not a friendship with a lifer or a death row inmate you have to watch yourself they will act like the nicest person to you and if you are gullible they will make you believe they were placed there wrongly they are constantly trying to manipulate
9352014 when i put on the uniform i become sergeant cobb
9352015 im silly im the nuttiest mom but once i walk through the gate the officer comes out
9352016 if i say ladies stand for count those that dont well dont ask me for anything for the rest of the day its almost like being a mother we are everything to them mother teacher security provider babysitter we give them nourishment and tell them what they can and cant do
9352017 i got a needle and thread and showed her how to sew on a button she was so excited i had a pep talk with her and i tried to quell her fears
9352018 these are just regular ladies who have committed bad crimes
9352019 hi mr edwards today is my last day here ill miss you
9352020 well i hope i dont see you any time soon
9352021 if i told a male inmate what to do hed go and do it if i tell a woman what to do they will ask me why
9352022 you know theyre not going to get out and it makes it harder that theyre women
9352023 because you dont expect it from a woman if a woman goes and butchers somebody it makes us all look bad as women
9352024 the first thing i think of is that a good third of the inmates probably didnt do their crime or they were protecting themselves the judicial system stinks its not fair a lot of the lifers they got life sentences back in the 1960s and 70s when women did not commit horrendous crimes so they were instantly given life sentences nowadays that same crime they get five years but when you get someone on death row you know they did it
9352025 when her death warrant got signed she was scared at that time and its changed since then we had constant watch constant watch is when an officer sits right in front of the door and literally watches that inmate 24 7
9352026 the officers that i dont want to work with are those without self esteem if you are scared or if youre in to make friends youre doomed some officers will come in trying to please the inmates always trying to say the right thing
9352027 im fair consistent im the same every day they like consistency when i say something i follow through whether its an officer or an inmate i never leave anyone hanging
9352028 my faith tells me everyone has something to give even the most criminal person there has to be something decent in there
9352029 we had a girl who had just come in had killed her two year old baby she had burnt it starved it to death and my son was two years old at the time it haunted me i was a single mom i went home held my baby and bawled with that particular inmate it was never the same you just dont want to know the persons details
9352030 have i been angry enough when i think i could have killed someone sure but at that moment in a sane sensible person lurks the question whats going to happen if i do this
9352031 whereas these women they dropped off the deep edge either they didnt care or they didnt think what the repercussions would be i cant answer for them i wasnt in their shoes but no i cant sympathise when you walk into that environment you cant cry for them we have 1 200 inmates thats too many tears
9352032 my life on the outside is more important to me than my life here
9352033 miguel es un chico muy fresco y con buena energ a pero por cosas que le han pasado en la vida los chicos le ver n como alguien extra o casi bipolar

9352044 i am confident and believe that all the trials we are facing today can be overcome if we remain united and work together with firm determination
9352045 a united people is the countrys strongest line of defence in facing any situation both internally and externally
9352046 no one citizen is recognized as being of a higher position than another in this nation this nation belongs to all of us whether we rise or fall depends on all of us
9352047 i am confident and believe that all the trials we are facing today can be overcome if we remain united and work together with firm determination

9352050 captain mccain was upset but he didnt go on talking about it very long

9352074 joining elizabeth may and joining the green party feels a lot like coming home
9352075 they deserve a strong voice in the house of commons and they deserve a strong voice in the leadership debate
9352076 this is the first time anyone with the house of commons parliamentary seal is wearing a green party button
9352077 a green mp sitting in the house of commons it will now be impossible to exclude the green party from the televised leaders debates in the next election
9352078 mr gilles duceppe of the bloc quebecois has the opportunity to participate in the debates but not i theres something not quite right there
9352079 not only do i embrace the policies of my new party i will feel that all my past difficulties are justified if by my actions i can make a real difference by ensuring elizabeth may is included in the leaders debates

9352081 janik while off duty on august 17 was informed that a window was broken at the tasemkin furniture store 4609 s ashland av and after investigating ordered john wroble 44 of 4609 s marshfield av to guard the window while he reported it upon returning lyons said janik took a radio from the window and gave it to wroble for his trouble
9352082 the former tasemkin furniture store at 46th and ashland you can look at the marquee to see what once drew the crowds there household appliances by admiral zenith speed queen crown roper and scratched out on the left there amana all advertised under the crisp colorful flash of neon do these names mean anything anymore today i bet they would generate about as much foot traffic as would a double feature starring john agar and faith domergue
9352083 is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human cancer tumours but inactive in most normal cells
9352084 that means that a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9352085 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9352086 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes in initiate telomere replication
9352087 there is no doubt that having determined the structure of telomerase is extremely important in understanding cancer biology and will probably help lead us in the development of telomerase inhibitors
9352088 but whether these inhibitors will ultimately represent an effective class of anti cancer treatments it is too early to say
9352089 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and brain
9352090 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring

9352094 as always i brought you some nice things at least they seemed nice
9352095 i uhm thought you might like them they are just well
9352096 its all right i didnt really like that wine anyway
9352097 i dont need a fight tonight you go sit down lets forget this
9352098 the night is young and you are oh so pure i will come back of that be sure and that time you will do as i command
9352099 you know that hotel it was the one that doutzen kroes in for that escapes issue itll be entirely closed for our vip guests
9352100 its less about the literalness of what is occurring on screen and more about what remains in our minds and influences us after weve seen a film or a work of art
9352101 i like the idea of contemporary performers re enacting lines combined from past films in order to create new scenes and new situations like my previous video series hypnotic cascade it aims to make vague the boundaries between the worlds of contemporary art cinema and fashion
9352102 i think surfing is very simpatico with whats going on in fashion right now
9352103 theres a longing for authenticity and surfing has a very real and very stylish heritage
9352104 exotic locations good looking people surf film and surf photography have played a huge part in making the culture of surfing resonate even to a kid in kansas say whos never laid eyes on the ocean
9352105 i had to really play a lot more aggressive because its quite windy and she was a lot more solid than i was in the first set
9352106 i took a bit more control in the second and cruised through in the third so i am really pleased
9352107 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9352108 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9352109 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9352110 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9352111 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9352112 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9352113 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9352114 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes
9352115 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9352116 he doesnt have a sore arm and he doesnt have a dead arm he might have a little bit of a tired arm its muscular
9352117 padres starter josh geer changed speeds and kept the ball out of the middle
9352118 there wasnt enough in the recipe for us to win
9352119 im making better pitches now than i was before im commanding my fastball a lot better and im able to stay ahead in a lot more counts
9352120 we need to salvage a game in this series and tomorrow is our last chance you dont want to come down here and get swept
9352121 basically the guys put three runs on the board for me and if i did my job we would have had a good chance to win the game
9352122 zambrano doesnt have a sore arm and he doesnt have a dead arm
9352123 its muscular in the triceps area and thats where you get tired we can shorten him up
9352124 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9352125 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9352126 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9352127 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9352128 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9352129 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9352130 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9352131 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9352132 chris told me to just make sure to hold onto the ball
9352133 i dont want to be one of those people who tries every antidepressant on the market
9352134 by the way im a medically created mutant of a person
9352135 i think i may have been done it back to back a couple of times but thats exciting man
9352136 how does that happen the ball goes 5 10 inches over the wall two days in a row thats pretty impressive im just happy to be able to use that glove thats what owner arte moreno got me over here for
9352137 im going to try and get some sleep tonight if itll let me and ill assess the situation tomorrow when i get to the ballpark
9352138 pretty much from the get go i didnt have my good stuff
9352139 right when i got out there i knew something wasnt right i was struggling to get ahead it was just brutal
9352140 but again ive watched this for a number of years hes one of the best right hand hitters that has played the game in my lifetime he doesnt give an at bat away
9352141 so even though yeah i went deep into the game i still look at it as a disappointing start because you know that your job is sometimes the starting pitcher has to pick up the offense and vice versa
9352142 you miss one play in a game and its a tough loss
9352143 it basically comes down to executing pitches some i executed and some i didnt

9352156 you know the des moines convention amp visitors bureau really should make our friend steve roberts king of des moines because there was a very serious attempt to take this all away from us
9352157 however that still has to be approved on the floor by the entire convention
9352158 michigan and florida were both adamant that we are not capable or worthy of seelcting presidents of the united states
9352159 i wasnt privy to what happened in the back room
9352160 i only know that a compromise was crafted with individuals from south carolina new hampshire and our national committeeman steve roberts was really the ring leader on that and was able to get it accomplished it was a phenomenal thing to watch being political myself it was a new experience and i was impressed

9352163 were showing that the geologic record shows that in the past ice sheets have melted much faster than were predicting at the end of this century
9352164 it could easily be more than double what is suggested
9352165 the ice sheet was existing in a pretty warm climate and what we show is that that sunlight was enough to melt the ice sheet away very rapidly
9352166 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9352167 this new evidence indicates that glacial is anything but slow
9352168 this finding shows the potential for ice to disappear quickly given the right push
9352169 they now predict a half metre sea level rise with most of that coming from the expansion of the ocean due to warming and very little of that coming from ice sheet meting
9352170 ice sheet melting could be a much bigger component so these values should be seen as low estimates

9352352 ich habe nichts zu meckern wir bringen derzeit wirklich top leistungen das war auch gegen austria schon so nur hat nach dem vorfall mit georg koch keiner mehr ber das 3 0 gesprochen
9352353 bei uns ist sehr sehr viel auf offensive ausgerichtet und es gibt in der liga nicht viele mannschaften die mit zwei echten st rmern agieren
9352354 meine leistung war schlecht ber andere urteile ich nicht das steht mir nicht zu fakt ist dass wir gegen jimmy hoffer absolut keine chance hatten

9352376 we are not advocates of sanctions and consider them to be a last resort

9352378 in these international accords we will define our obligations to provide aid economic social humanitarian and military
9352379 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine
9352380 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9352381 absolutely in accordance with international law in georgia and suggested that eu leaders pushing for tough measures were serving us interests
9352382 whatever happens and whatever is being said truth is on our side
9352383 we acted absolutely and morally in accordance with international law
9352384 if some european countries want to serve someone elses foreign policy interests then we cant stop them

9352386 were showing that the geologic record shows that in the past ice sheets have melted much faster than were predicting at the end of this century
9352387 it could easily be more than double what is suggested
9352388 the ice sheet was existing in a pretty warm climate and what we show is that that sunlight was enough to melt the ice sheet away very rapidly
9352389 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9352390 this new evidence indicates that glacial is anything but slow
9352391 this finding shows the potential for ice to disappear quickly given the right push
9352392 they now predict a half metre sea level rise with most of that coming from the expansion of the ocean due to warming and very little of that coming from ice sheet meting
9352393 ice sheet melting could be a much bigger component so these values should be seen as low estimates
9352394 we are faced with the situation of clergy in both parishes who have expressly rejected the anglican church of canada as their home and have left the church yet continue to occupy church buildings that are set aside for use by parishes in the anglican church of canada
9352395 the plaintiffs have not at this stage established a strong case that they and their fellow parishioners who have elected to join the network are the beneficial owners of church property because they represent true anglicans and the remaining parishioners do not
9352396 ordered us out at both churches and gave both churches to the diocese until full trial
9352397 there has been an acknowledgment in ontario and b c that the trust case who owns the properties still has to be argued
9352398 we dont recognize the diocese of new westminster and their authority to simply ignore the constitution and bylaws of the parish corporations
9352399 weve offered to sit down with them and talk about this but at this point weve been rebuffed
9352400 i think the unions are more relevant today than theyve ever been they have more resources today and im not down at all on the movement
9352401 the trade issue was huge in terms the companies ability to put investment and their jobs wherever they want and simply ship back into our market
9352402 the auto sector is best example we have 25 per cent of our market that goes to importers from japan korea and the european community and were taking a beating as an economy
9352403 i dont think we challenge ourselves enough in terms of our internal processes
9352404 one of the things thats bothered me is the no raiding pact which essentially says if you join a union youre there for life i think if one union doesnt satisfy your concerns you should have a right to join another
9352405 were fighting back were not accepting the logic that you have to cut your standard of living and everything will be fine
9352406 i think workers appreciate that in canada at least were fighting for them
9352407 we found the newborn brain responds with increased activation to these repeated words the words that had the repeated syllables
9352408 newborn babies are able to learn about the structures of language as long as the structure is simple enough namely through repetition
9352409 the learning process actually starts on day one or maybe even before in the womb
9352410 a baby who doesnt really know anything about the world and doesnt receive any explicit teaching picks language up in two three years
9352411 our results show is that these sounds or these forms are easy to learn
9352412 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9352413 this new evidence from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past icesheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9352414 we have never seen an ice sheet retreat significantly or even disappear before yet this may happen for the greenland icesheet in the coming centuries to millennia
9352415 the new work suggests that future reductions of the greenland ice sheet on the order of one metre 3 25 feet per century are not out of the question
9352416 i had to really play a lot more aggressive than i did in the first set
9352417 it was windy out there and if you just tried to put the ball in there it floats
9352418 she was stronger in the first set so i had to pick it up in the second set and especially in the third
9352419 it would be nice to come back to the number one spot
9352420 it would be great if i can do it we will see what happens

9352430 il ragazzo deve chiarirsi le idee se vuole restare da marted dei nostri mentre se vuole andare via io non posso fare nulla per trattenerlo
9352431 avrei preferito un esordio con meno problemi di formazione ma sono davvero contento di come la squadra ha iniziato la stagione una vittoria importante al termine di una gara dove gli avversari non hanno quasi mai impensierito il nostro portiere penso dia tanti segnali positivi garics una sicurezza manzoni era un p teso per lesordio ma credo che abbia fatto molto bene latalanta deve portare avanti un progetto in cui tanti giovani vengono lanciati ottenendo soddisfazioni con la salvezza come primo obiettivo stimo molto mister giampaolo un amico a cui piace lavorare insegnando calcio e spero che il futuro gli riservi tante soddisfazioni noi questanno abbiamo il vantaggio di partire con una stagione come quella passata in cui abbiamo lavorato bene credo si possa fare qualcosa di importante
9352432 e il mio primo gol di testa in tutta la carriera sono molto contento perch ho iniziato bene con una rete da 3 punti
9352433 ho saputo questa mattina che avrei giocato ho cercato di fare del mio meglio e credo di aver fatto abbastanza bene il mister e i compagni mi hanno detto di stare tranquillo di giocare semplice che le giocate sarebbero venute senza problemi in occasione del gol ho provato a smarcare ferreira pinto con un colpo di tacco mi andata bene ed venuta fuori lazione che ha deciso la partita
9352434 mi piaciuto lapproccio alla gara della squadra dopo pochi minuti abbiamo sciupato una grande occasione per passare in vantaggio e dopo la rete di padoin abbiamo avuto un momento difficile nel secondo tempo abbiamo provato a spingere di pi con la terza punta cercavamo il pari ma la difesa dellatalanta ha retto benissimo fino alla fine e loro hanno portato a casa la vittoria penso che il siena meritasse un risultato diverso ma latalanta unottima squadra e non ha rubato nulla
9352435 hmmm i wonder if i should find out where everyone is going

9352438 since bush and chaney are letting another hurricane hit n o if only they had stopped global warming when algore told them too
9352439 i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9352440 sotto laspetto del risultato sono soddisfatto per quanto riguarda il gioco potevamo fare molto di pi ma abbiamo vinto e questo fa ben sperare per il futuro oggi era molto caldo e abbiamo un po sofferto ma limpegno non mai mancato e credo questanno non mancher mai il loro gol scaturito da unincomprensione della nostra difesa non lo chiamerei errore la difesa ha fatto una grande prova sono soddisfatto
9352441 quando sono uscito andavo abbastanza bene ma ero stato ammonito e vedevo che gli avversari mi cercavano io non potevo fare pi nessun fallo altrimenti sarei stato espulso cos abbiamo deciso per il cambio
9352442 c rammarico per lo stadio vuoto ma i tifosi ci hanno fatto un regalo
9352443 il taranto non mi dispiaciuto nel primo tempo abbiamo eseguito al meglio sia la fase di possesso che di non possesso dopo il primo gol potevamo anche chiudere lincontro purtroppo non labbiamo fatto la juve stabia nel primo tempo ha avuto poche possibilit un risultato bugiardo che non accetto poi gli episodi nel calcio decidono molte cose ma se giocheremo sempre con questa intensit faremo bene non ho schierato pagliuca perch in settimana aveva dei problemi alal schiena shala pu giocare al meglio sia al centro che sulla fascia bene nel primo tempo ma anche per buona parte della ripresa il taranto ha molti margini di miglioramento e una sconfitta che lascia lamaro in bocca ma per la trasferta di foligno non sono preoccupato
9352444 la squadra si rafforzer domani saremo a milano per il calciomercato e l pu succedere di tutto puntiamo a un centrocampista esterno e faremo di tutto per prenderlo in uscita vedremo possiamo acquistare 4 elementi e cederne tre se capita loccasione giusta non ci tireremo indietro dionigi e un calciatore del taranto sconfitta ingiusta ma la juve stabia una squadra costruita per vincere ha fatto la sua partita ho visto un grande taranto abbiamo costruito pi palle gol per far nostro lincontro non sono preoccupato solo la prima giornata di campionato mancata la lucidit e poi si avvertita la stanchezza dionigi in genere non sbaglia cos tanto ricordiamoci la prima giornata dello scorso campionato a perugia dove la squadra non cera in campo affatto
9352445 in questo periodo mi hanno accostato a diverse squadre soprattutto al modena ma resto a taranto ho fatto gol su rigore sono contento per questo poi brunner ha fatto diversi miracoli altrimenti nel primo tempo eravamo sopra di tre gol nella ripresa poi si ripetuto su migliaccio per oltre unora il taranto ha giocato un buon calcio ottima lintesa con marolda tommaso un grande calciatore dispiace aver perso sono contento del mio gol soprattutto perch vengo da un lungo infortunio e giusto perdere quando giochi male oggi c stato un buon taranto la dedica a dio naturale quando segni dopo due anni difficili come i miei
9352446 sono contento per la mia prestazione era un anno he non giocavo una gara intera lintesa con i compagni migliora di giorno in giorno e col tempo si perfezioner la squadra ha lottatto ed il gruppo unito i margini di miglioramento sono tanti posso giocare ovunque poi decide lallenatore
9352447 siamo stati a fare pendere la partita dalla nostra parte poteva pendere sia da un lato che dallaltro la prima gara di campionato sempre un po particolare e per questo devo dire bravi ai ragazzi perch siamo andati sotto e siamo riusciti a rimanere sempre in partita la squadra ha sicuramente meritato
9352448 sono contentissimo per il gol vittoria io sono nativo di taranto e per questo ci tenevo molto a far bene contro la squadra della mia citt sono contento per il risultato dedico il gol alla mia famiglia alla societ e ai tifosi
9352449 secondo me la roma aveva condotto bene la gara passando in vantaggio e tenendo bene il campo
9352450 i tre punti non sono arrivati perch abbiamo fallito qualche occasione di troppo e incontrato un ottimo napoli
9352451 forse sar stato il caldo ma pur mettendocela tutta la stanchezza si faceva sentire oggi andata cos ma il campionato lungo la mia prova potevo fare di pi cos come tutta la squadra il tempo per fare meglio c e lo sfrutteremo
9352452 non sono ancora al meglio fisicamente ma mi ha fatto piacere giocare nelloccasione del gol sbagliato mi venuto a mancare il piede dappoggio al momento della conclusione
9352453 sono soddisfatto di questa vittoria in quanto la squadra ha dimostrato di saper stare bene in campo in effetti esordire davanti al nostro pubblico con una vittoria ti d morale e fiducia anche perch dopo la sosta ci sar la trasferta a lecce squadra tosta
9352454 credo che la vittoria ci sta tutta analizzando il primo tempo abbiamo avuto diverse occasioni ma non siamo riusciti a sfruttarle o meglio stato bravo il portiere avversario campagnolo a neutralizzarle importante era vincere perch la reggina sar una diretta concorrente ai fini della salvezza
9352455 purtroppo nel primo tempo non siamo esistiti nella ripresa abbiamo cercato di affondare il colpo direi che il risultato figlio di due episodi ovvero i due rigori per me quello dato al chievo discutibile comunque nulla da eccepire prendiamo atto della sconfitta e speriamo di recuperare in fretta giocatori come cozza e brienza che forti della loro esperienza possono dare fantasia a centrocampo la qualit che nella gara odierna venuta a mancare

9352489 we wanted to make instruction available to students 24 7 and to provide student access to advice and productivity tools anytime and anywhere that made sense to them
9352490 with this consolidation we have addressed the need to have all of our servers centralized where they can be stored backed up and protected all in one location the dell solution provided everything from set up to the removal of our old pcs and boxes

9352494 the neon boneyard is a brilliant setting as always and joaquins underground lair is genuinely creepy
9352495 compulsively readable upon finishing i immediately wanted to read the next in the series laurie faria stolarz is my kind of writer
9352496 this series has its fans and theres reasonable enough evidence in the world building and class structure
9352497 that something published in 1978 seems more believable realistic and relatable than most books on the market today says a lot
9352498 everything fits together well the characters seem well formed and the plots intriguing
9352499 videotaped police behavior at the 2004 gop convention in new york and helped get charges dismissed against hundreds of protesters who were arrested
9352500 i would have done this i would have put that over there
9352501 i remember him talking about her when he came back
9352502 he said she was an impressive woman he liked her
9352503 i ask my staff never to hand me paper until two seconds before i need it because i will lose it
9352504 ive got to have somebody around me who is keeping track of that stuff and thats not trivial i need to have good people in place who can make sure that systems run thats what ive always done and thats why we run not only a good campaign but a good u s senate office
9352505 that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9352506 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9352507 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9352508 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9352509 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9352510 well at least we held florida or some other sec school close
9352511 i got off to kind of a slow start with a few jitters
9352512 after that i feel like i got into a rhythm and things started slowing down a little bit we did some things well but we have a lot of room for improvement
9352513 we knew we probably wouldnt get a sack going into the game they were in the shotgun all night and they dont hold the ball
9352514 we have what we have out there injuries are part of the game there was some good some bad it was an average performance
9352515 conversation was rendered almost impossible by the artists persistent silence
9352516 how can one be compelled to accept slavery i simply refuse to do the masters bidding he may torture me break my bones to atoms and even kill me he will then have my dead body not my obedience ultimately therefore it is i who am the victor and not he for he has failed in getting me to do what he wanted done
9352517 so my suggestion then is to open our eyes to the virtual not as a futuristic technology but as it already shapes and defines the world around us through time by taking the visual appearance of things as immaterial forms with material affectivity we allow ourselves to move beyond the limitations of physical presence which demands that one thing cannot be something else or somewhere else at the same time the reduction of culture to the social should be replaced by an inquiry into the proliferation of the social through the cultural as so many experiences of the virtual in time and space
9352518 if thats not what you want then i am willing to be content to keep things how they are not my will but yours be done
9352519 eu no so feliz peliando no coliseo bernabeusis e prefero emigrar as terras sajonas que pagan mais denarios toi moito cabreadu por ser moneda do cambio en operaci n ronaldus no foi valorado a suo momento por madrilenius cuando eu quer a renovar e agora mi corasao e el meu bolsillo est con chelsius

9352521 rather pathetic how about you try and get a life
9352522 as is well known i was adamantly opposed to the spending spree that we went on and predicted that we would be in the difficulties as far as our physical sanity is concerned if we continued the largest increase in government since the great society and i urged vetoes

9352528 sister paula was at the very forefront of the hardest struggles for dignity and equal rights for those living with hiv and dying of aids
9352529 she was a wise adviser guide mentor and confidante for nzaf board and executive directors and a champion of those who were vulnerable to hiv and suffered the cruelty of discrimination and stigma
9352530 nzaf has been truly blessed to count her as family and her death marks the loss of a uniquely special woman to all new zealanders
9352531 these mice were normal and we could tell which were new nerve cells and they should be functional
9352532 we believe those neurons are very important for olfactory system sense of smell
9352533 normal mice quickly learn which hole to get to where its dark and has bedding for the mutants they learn where to hide but after a week they totally forget they completely lose their memory
9352534 we are waiting a while more to see if there could be loss of the sense of smell
9352535 in some damaged brains like after a stroke there is no neurogenesis generation of new brain cells we are interested in knowing where nerve cells come from and whether we can stimulate neurogenesis
9352536 john keys stance shows that he has no respect for basic new zealand values of fair play
9352537 i have to have confidence in them and confidence in their word the sheer weight of allegations and the actions of mr peters in the last few months means that i have lost that confidence in him
9352538 i think its highly unlikely he will be able to resolve to my satisfaction answers to all of those allegations and that still leaves you with his handling of the situation
9352539 ill give you this prediction that if winston is there and he has the numbers to make john key the prime minister youll find john key finds very quick reasons why winstons a man of high integrity fast
9352540 as is so often the case jim anderton has got it wrong
9352541 a nice lifeline for them so no one in this situation has got their hands completely clean
9352542 if youre sitting around a cabinet table with someone you have to be able to trust them you have to be able to take their word
9352543 you take into account as to whether you can do business with that person subsequently
9352544 witnesses describe an offender who got out of a vehicle and shot at the victim
9352545 this looks like a planned event there will be a reason for it and that is what we will work to establish
9352546 with the information we currently have it appears this shooting is not random
9352547 this period can be used to look for jobs and after getting one a student can apply for work permit
9352548 but it was an event unrelated to publising that gave the greatest momentum to speculative fiction at 8 00 p m on the evening of october 30 1938 the twenty three year old orson welles staged the first radio broadcast of h g wellss 1898 story the war of the worlds
9352549 russia does not want confrontation with any country russia does not plan to isolate itself russia will develop as far as possible its relations with europe with the united states of america and with other countries
9352550 everyone should understand that if someone launches an aggressive sortie he will receive a response
9352551 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9352552 thus europe would only be hurting itself if we were to get full of emotion and slam all the doors shut to the rooms that we will want to enter afterwards
9352553 whatever people say right is on our side we conducted ourselves absolutely morally and in line with international law
9352554 the leaders discussed the importance of supporting georgias territorial integrity and the need for russia to comply with all elements of the ceasefire agreement and withdraw its troops from georgia
9352555 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9352556 no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9352557 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9352558 no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge

9352564 a maioria dos homens heterossexuais detesta discuss es de relacionamento j os gays adoram

9352567 not accept a world order where all decisions are made by one side even such a powerful one as the usa
9352568 we will develop in as much as is possible friendly ties with europe the usa and other countries in the world
9352569 that thing youre doing with your tongue it tickles my mouth
9352570 when you live in an area thats heavily populated by theists its understandable that one would feel some social and psychological pressures from that community this can lead to feelings of inadequacy loneliness isolation and even embarrassment when one is feeling judged or ridiculed
9352571 its possible your back up will take longer because he or she will be on the other side of the county so especially at night your going to have less people on the road which will take longer for them to get to you if you get in a serious situation
9352572 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9352573 this new evidence from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past icesheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9352574 we have never seen an ice sheet retreat significantly or even disappear before yet this may happen for the greenland icesheet in the coming centuries to millennia
9352575 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9352576 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9352577 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9352578 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9352579 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9352580 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9352581 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9352582 if you were to talk to dick cheneys daughter who is a lesbian she would tell you that shes being who she was shes being who she was born as
9352583 you saw a man who will say and do anything in order to get elected and i am not just speaking as a father here though i am a pretty angry father
9352584 john kerry didnt out me nor did he offend or attack me by calling me a lesbian
9352585 it wasnt a secret that i was gay and i certainly couldnt be offended by the truth she writes what was offensive was that he was obviously trying to use me and my sexual orientation for his own political gain
9352586 we used to cut down many trees for agricultural use which brought us a lot of hardship including windstorms decreased rainfall and increased solar intensity
9352587 the amount of rainfall has dramatically increased in the last five years and heat from the sun has reduced and we now have better yield
9352588 we were doing everything by ourselves but we realised that we were not achieving much and we now involve local communities around the forests without whose help we would fail in our conservation efforts
9352589 the government now devolves more power to the forest communities in conserving the forests and shares the revenues coming from the forests and the results are quite remarkable
9352590 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9352591 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9352592 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9352593 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9352594 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9352595 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9352596 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9352597 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9352598 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9352599 chris told me to just make sure to hold onto the ball
9352600 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge

9352602 magomed yevloyev was arrested today in ingushetia and was killed
9352603 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile
9352604 we will resequence the gene regions we have identified to pinpoint the causative mutations in these genes
9352605 we strongly suspect one gene will provide a compelling target for drug development given whats known about its biology
9352606 although the gene variants we found may have a stronger signal in pediatric ibd than in adult onset ibd we do not believe them to be limited to varieties of the disease that begin in childhood
9352607 as we better understand the complex gene interactions in ibd we may be able to diagnose patients by their genetic profile to predict who will better respond to anti tnf drugs
9352608 if better knowledge of the disease pathway enables pharmaceutical companies to develop anti tnf drugs in pill form the medications will be easier to deliver as well as more customized to each patient
9352609 we wish that top leaders would visit hiroshima and nagasaki while they are in power at least once to see the atrocity of the nuclear bombings

9352617 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to effect at the rock en seine show in paris due to distemper she was enchanted ailing at her house and wasnt good to rove to france during the concert
9352618 wir hatten zwei unterschiedliche hinterreifen zur auswahl und ich konnte mich erst in der startaufstellung entscheiden
9352619 ich habe auf die weichere reifenmischung zur ckgegriffen weil ich dachte so zu beginn des rennens ein paar vorteile zu haben nat rlich war es nicht die beste wahl aber wir hatten ein wesentlich besseres rennen als in br nn und ich habe mein bestes gegeben daher bin ich recht gl cklich
9352620 das war definitiv f r alle ein physisch sehr anspruchsvolles rennen es war sehr hei viel hei er als gestern
9352621 abgesehen davon kann ich sagen dass ich zufrieden mit dem ergebnis bin ich hatte ehrlich gesagt nicht erwartet am ende noch vierter zu werden in der zweiten h lfte hatten wir ein paar probleme
9352622 platz vier ist nicht so gut weil wir heute das podium anvisiert hatten
9352623 dani hat gut gek mpft es ist gro artig ihn nach einem schwierigen wochenende in br nn in so starker verfassung zu sehen jetzt bleiben uns noch f nf rennen brig wir wollen unbedingt noch rennen gewinnen
9352624 hut ab vor einem fahrer der in einem solchen zustand berhaupt so schnell fahren kann
9352625 casey hat stechende schmerzen wie man im warmup an seinem gesicht sehen konnte
9352626 wenn du so einen schmerz im falschen moment abbekommst liegst du drau en das ist auf dem motorrad etwas anderes als in der garage aber es ist immer noch der gleiche casey wie fr her er vollbringt manchmal wahre wunder hut ab vor einem fahrer der in einem solchen zustand berhaupt so schnell fahren kann
9352627 es ist wichtig dass wir in solchen momenten als team zusammenhalten
9352628 wir verlassen misano zumindest im wissen dass wir ein konkurrenzf higes motorrad ein gutes team und einen wahrlich au ergew hnlichen fahrer haben ich bin stolz darauf mit casey stoner zusammenzuarbeiten
9352629 aber zumindest haben wir bewiesen wie schnell wir sind unser motorrad und unsere reifen funktionieren ganz fantastisch das stimmt mich f r n chstes jahr zuversichtlich denn darauf freue ich mich jetzt schon und was meine hier aufgebrochene verletzung angeht das nervt mich gewaltig aber ich werde mich erst nach saisonende operieren lassen
9352630 wir haben uns im warmup daf r entschieden eine runde auf den neuen rennreifen zu fahren um die oberfl che ein bisschen aufzurauen das machen wir sonst auch und es war noch nie ein problem aber heute stimmte der grip von der ersten runde an nicht nach ein paar runden wurde es besser aber dann war er auf einmal wieder weg
9352631 dabei habe ich in der zweiten kurve wegen vermeulen der fast abgeflogen w re viele pl tze verloren ich w re ihm beinahe reingefahren
9352632 ich muss aber sagen dass ich von der ersten runde an ein gutes gef hl hatte
9352633 ich ging an de angelis vorbei aber er wollte offensichtlich kontern und tat das in einer kurve in der man nicht berholen sollte wir ber hrten uns und ich kam von der linie ab dabei verlor ich noch mehr zeit langsam erholte ich mich davon und ich schnappte mir noch einige gegner aber die gruppe vor mir war zu weit weg sonst w re ein noch besseres resultat drin gewesen
9352634 f r mich ist es ein bisschen wie nach hause kommen ich erinnere mich gern an meine zeit in der formel 3 euroserie
9352635 die dtm wird auch von den formel 1 kollegen beobachtet
9352636 nat rlich ist es der traum fast eines jeden mannes eine motorsportlizenz zu machen und rennen zu fahren daf r br uchte ich allerdings mehr zeit die ich so noch nicht habe
9352637 die piloten der dtm sind alle hochtrainierte sportler sehr beeindruckend
9352638 morgens esse ich eigentlich nur eine kleinigkeit das fr hst ck von sarah war sehr vielf ltig eindeutig ein besserer start in den tag
9352639 wir haben hier in der heimat des motorsports wie man ja sagt etwas sehr sehr tolles f r den produktionswagensport getan mit einem bekenntnis des adac mit dem besuch des f hrenden der formel 1 weltmeisterschaft und mit dem denkbar knappsten rennergebnis alles in allem positiv
9352640 er ist ein gro er dtm fan und war ja vor drei jahren noch im rahmenprogramm unterwegs klar er kann kaum einen schritt vor den anderen setzen und hat heute wahrscheinlich einen neuen autogrammschreib rekord aufgestellt
9352641 wenn ich das berrundungsman ver sehe als bernd schneider von timo scheider berrundet wurde kann ich nur sagen dass ich genau so etwas w nsche das ist hochkultur wie sich das geh rt da kann man allen fahrern einen gl ckwunsch dazu sagen es war wirklich toll
9352642 wir haben zehn kilogramm mehr gewicht und haben uns da speziell mit paul nat rlich gut geschlagen wir haben wenig falsch gemacht es war sicherlich ein schwieriges rennen 82 runden das ist wie ein kleines langstreckenrennen man kann vieles falsch machen
9352643 bei noch drei ausstehenden rennen ist es lange noch nicht vorbei auch mit neun punkten vorsprung wir haben auf dem weg ein paar punkte liegen lassen angefangen schon in hockenheim aber ich habe schon andere dinge erlebt ich habe schon andere vorspr nge erlebt die dann noch aufgeholt worden sind und wir sind racer

9352675 to me without even blinking their eyes hahaha prs embroiled in internal conflicts for far too long should move a step forward james masing will have to make the right calls and the right choices on who sticks with him and who gets washed away by the rushing flood waters

9353111 i tried to relax and think about the way i was pitching in louisville
9353112 i threw mostly fastballs and changeups with two or three sliders
9353113 both the fastball and changeup was working so i mixed them both and had good location with both pitches
9353114 the bullpen has been slipping a little bit after doing the job most of the year and they dont call these the dog days for nothing
9353115 he had 98 pitches and we wanted him to leave on a positive note
9353116 it was a very good seven innings one of the better seven innings from somebody we called up and it might be the best
9353117 he was calm and cool and you could tell he is a good athlete he gave us what we needed
9353118 i was still strong still feeling good i didnt get the victory but the important thing was that the team won
9353119 the passport gave him reason to suspect u s military involvement in the russia georgia conflict over south ossetia

9353128 not much you do surprises me youre too much like me
9353129 its just that hes gone through this every year the last four or five years at a point in time where his arm feels a little bit heavy tired
9353130 i think everybody goes through that i think its a little bit of a dead arm period
9353131 he has felt a lot better the last couple of days as he sees everything coming back hell get better hell get on his stride
9353132 i just have to wait until my arm strength and power come back
9353133 not only me it happens to other pitchers especially when you are a power pitcher the most important thing and the thing to learn here is to know how to pitch with this i think this is the time when you have 170 innings close to 180 innings you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm
9353134 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9353135 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9353136 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9353137 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9353138 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9353139 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9353140 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9353141 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well
9353142 chris told me to just make sure to hold onto the ball
9353143 stop us if youve heard this before a tax for bart
9353144 the woman who is wearing mustard is bold and wants to be a trendsetter
9353145 when youre wearing mustard the fabric is usually opaque and pretty strong with your makeup your best bet is to keep it matte matte makeup with matte fabrics
9353146 navy will make the whites of the eyes look brighter and when you wear mustard you want a bright and light face
9353147 its very modern to match the color family of the cheek and lip and modern is also really warm and neutral
9353148 food is the number one product advertised to kids followed by media such as music video games and movies
9353149 the green dots identify players who have coach to qb radio communication devices in their helmets only one player with the coach qb device can be on the field at a time so this makes it easy for the officials to identify
9353150 why dont the players ever trip over the yellow marker
9353151 source of secondary housing demand as they eliminate housing opportunities for low and moderate income households
9353152 the court mandated that we change our methodology and we increase the obligation of towns to provide affordable housing and as part of that all growth is included
9353153 continually dwindling resources and a unit moving towards unsafe clinical practice
9353154 the big storms that caused flooding in canterbury and marlborough last week really didnt produce a lot of rain in the southern lakes
9353155 they the lakes have started to dry up over the past few weeks it hasnt been particularly good news for hydro storage
9353156 with the climate you can never be absolutely categorical but we expect it to certainly not improve on the situation its at now
9353157 obviously the situation is tight and we are keeping a very close eye on things and taking a cautious and responsible approach
9353158 were a southland based company and that is where most of our catch comes from
9353159 we took it upon ourselves to cut quotas in order to rebuild stocks which is paying off
9353160 it was a well equipped racing yacht for whatever reason it just tipped over
9353161 there was no terrorists in iraq until the u s invaded them
9353162 we were not not expecting it nor were we looking for it
9353163 he falsified the entire thing in order to obtain the identification in a different name other than his true name
9353164 the government has the duty to safeguard the credibility of any sort of identification thats obtained through them
9353165 were happy with the intelligence that weve gathered and information thats come to light through the course of the investigation
9353166 apparently we helped because we help with these things sometimes
9353167 youve got to do something to make sure the account is considered active said golin an expert on dormant accounts with ing direct an online unit of the financial services giant ing group
9353168 otherwise the 10 000 you have saved for a rainy day might just be gone when you get around to trying to use it
9353169 abandoned assets was turned over to states in fiscal 2006 the latest year for which figures are available
9353170 theres a guy i work with who got a certificate of deposit when he got out of high school and was all excited when he graduated college because he was going to use it golin said
9353171 we were really appreciative that andy did the right thing and contacted the proper agencies to find out what options he had to deal with his situation
9353172 some people might have taken the boat out in the ocean and dealt with the problem in other ways
9353173 he built this boat in 1928 right here in the monterey boatworks which he ran from the mid 1920s until he died in 1956
9353174 that boat is basically the last of its kind around here there just isnt anything like it on monterey bay anymore
9353175 theres no question the gen pershing is a floating museum and its a testament to the boatbuilding abilities of the siino family that its still a working boat
9353176 weve got a marine geneticist who likes to use it for his research
9353177 we also enjoy taking it out for whale watching and things like that
9353178 when i got back from new orleans there were 30 some nests on the boat
9353179 the next time we went out there a couple of weeks later there were about 70 you take 70 nests holding two eggs each and figure theres a mother and father there for every nest that makes for a lot of birds our whole boat looked black
9353180 i can envision several days of pure clean up work
9353181 then well have to scrape it paint it grind the decks down the whole boat will have to be pressure washed and blasted then re primed
9353182 when we blast that stuff off we might end up blasting right through the roof
9353183 we dont know if the cabin roof will be any good after this
9353184 if we just shoveled that stuff overboard it would literally turn the water around the boat into a huge white oily mess
9353185 rented to buyers to beef up their loan applications inflated appraisals straw buyer scams and a wide variety of hanky panky schemes among sellers and purchasers designed to fool lenders
9353186 mortgage fraud used to be a crime of opportunity he said in an interview
9353187 now its a crime of necessity for people who are desperate to maintain lifestyles they became accustomed to during the housing boom years
9353188 dozens of sites online hawking fake income and employment verifications tax filings credit scores deposit verifications and
9353189 straw buyers people with good credit scores and incomes whod rent their names and asset verifications for home purchases by unqualified buyers
9353190 pretty gutting for them to score in that last minute of regulation time
9353191 we felt if we went into the shootout we probably could have beaten them in that
9353192 hes quite big so he can sprawl across the net and make a diving save
9353193 a couple of bounces and it goes the opposite teams way
9353194 the guys definitely played a lot better this year and gave it all they can definitely be proud of their performance its just disappointing we couldnt get the result we wanted
9353195 we just couldnt pull it off at the other end for him
9353196 im disappointed in that i thought we had enough chances to win the game but there were some outstanding individual efforts out there overall im very happy
9353197 we were unlucky with a couple of kicks the bounce of the ball and we couldve got away on them
9353198 but we looked down and out at 30 20 down so im just proud of the way the boys hung in there and didnt drop their heads
9353199 michael will be training at first five this week so we may be giving him his opportunity to start on friday night
9353200 faatonus done a great job but i think michael has come from the new zealand under 19s as a first five and we have not given him an opportunity to play 10 yet
9353201 further down the track we are still looking at who the number one first five is because obviously piri wants to play halfback come quarterfinals time
9353202 we are trying to work as a team not as individuals
9353203 thats whats kept us playing so well so far as soon as you start playing as individuals the whole thing just falls to pieces
9353204 hoseas playing with a lot of confidence and i think in the past hes been a bit overshadowed by other senior players
9353205 he has actually got quite an astute rugby mind and with the youth and enthusiasm of this group he feels he can speak out a bit more
9353206 this year theres been real growth in terms of what he says because he is really well respected by the players and i think thats reflecting in how hes playing
9353207 its just working on my work off the ball and trying to get my workrate up there as well
9353208 the thing with jamie joseph and andre bell coming into the team this year is theyve added a different look to the team we are playing differently to the wellington sides in the past and using a lot of width
9353209 i was so sure we had it at the start of the last stage we had enough gap to drive at a normal fast pace
9353210 thats not really my vision of rallying which should be about driving faster than the others
9353211 those lives were taken away from us and they want us to sit through a parole hearing on the exact day we should never have been put in the situation we found ourselves in
9353212 its an extremely unfortunate coincidence that the eligibility date falls on the same week im deeply saddened that the victims families have experienced this additional stress
9353213 we will have our memorial on the 8th and then we were to go from there to a parole meeting that would have been tough
9353214 we have indications of gold in certain areas but we dont know how much yet
9353215 were just working up to the drilling stage in a couple of areas
9353216 were just extending that and doing it in more detail
9353217 since we are on the wrong side of the storm we should start to see tornado threats
9353218 this is still a big ugly storm its still strong and i urge everyone to leave
9353219 that strikes me as exceptionally foolish people should heed the instructions to evacuate and protect their own lives
9353220 you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now
9353221 i have news for you that would be one of the biggest mistakes of your life
9353222 anyone who decides to stay ill say it like i said it before katrina make sure you have an axe because you will be carving your way or busting your way out of your attic to get on your roof with waters that you will be surrounded with in this event
9353223 no soporto esta maldita canci n cada vez que la canto me dan arcadas y el problema es que fue una gran canci n para nosotros
9353224 i spent too much time and energy trying to accomplish my mission
9353225 time and time again americans have demonstrated unmatched compassion and generosity helping millions of people around the world who experienced major hardships
9353226 its hard to imagine a greater humanitarian cause than helping our own u s military families who personally suffer from lasting wounds of war thousands are struggling with major financial problems that we cannot count on our government to solve
9353227 i think we took some time to settle down and kereru really took it to us once we settled we played pretty steadily right throughout the court
9353228 jamaar jamaar jamaar euh euh euh en wat en wat met al dat fijn stof dan
9353229 waarom zouden we verbieden dat mensen dronken achter het stuur kruipen als de trein nog altijd zoveel vertraging heeft
9353230 ach waar is de tijd dat debatterende ministers nog gewoon zaten te roken op tv
9353231 op het eerste gezicht leek het een gewone gouden tand maar toen besloot ik er mijn kleurencatalogus bij te halen
9353232 daar kan ik helaas geen uitsluitsel over geven daar de systemen in de vs en in europa niet geheel op elkaar zijn afgestemd
9353233 theyd said we would get told on friday and this was thursday night
9353234 i was in the detergent aisle and i just remember looking at the persil then she told me i was in and i couldnt stop smiling at the persil
9353235 then i just lost the plot i couldnt even think of what i wanted and just walked through the checkout smiling to myself
9353236 this time round its a lot sweeter because ive done so much more work for this this time i really wanted the yes youre in to come
9353237 if you ask someone what i was like as an 18 year old to how i am now im a totally different person im a lot more outgoing a lot more ready for things
9353238 when i was 18 i was the shyest person around i thought im here to play goal shoot and thats it im a different person now
9353239 i pretty much got over there to the commonwealth games and thought i was just the kid carrying the bags i didnt believe i was part of the team it blew me away
9353240 i came back and i just knew i wasnt ready for that stuff i didnt know anything about training i just needed a step back
9353241 then i was in and out of the squad and i took two years off i didnt want to be in international netball i didnt want to be in the squad and that was just time for me readjusting you know when youre younger and youre going through a lot of things
9353242 i think i was just getting into a bit of a rut in auckland i was benched put on the side and thats when you start questioning yourself and if you love the game anymore you do the hard yards then youre sitting on the bench
9353243 sting board representatives just said were looking at offering you something would you come down
9353244 it was the hardest choice but the best choice ive made in a long time robbie robyn broughton steel coach is one of a kind
9353245 we have to practise all the time sometimes i miss the close shots and theyre the easiest in the world so its about keeping at it
9353246 im going to get a hoop at home but shooting is one of those things you have to do by yourself you cant really do much else but put the ball through the hoop sometimes joe comes down but i really need some competition
9353247 thats the next step the team gets renamed after the australian test series so its staying in there
9353248 i know irenes not going to be around forever so i am working hard but also working on combinations and learning from her while she is around but hopefully ill be that next shooter
9353249 i guess it still hasnt really sunk in and it probably wont until i stand there singing the national anthem and until im presented with that black dress with my name on it and everyone can see it
9353250 for one time the regulation is going my way and will help me
9353251 we are second overall but 28 seconds behind mikko so thats a big gap i think
9353252 the only thing i can do is try and go as fast as i can
9353253 im sure everybody here wants to see the same fight as last year
9353254 i have the solution that will stop speaking about this all the time
9353255 there was no tactics it was just trying to push for the win
9353256 if we dont get the answers to the questions we have then we will look at appealing the decision
9353257 its a bit of a joke i think we did not even get considered at all
9353258 if there is an effect on land values it will be due to adverse effects on amenity it is the latter i have to consider
9353259 its silly to think id be able to keep up with those guys its only a freak thing you do every now and then
9353260 you cant compete with something that is worth a couple of million dollars has twice the power and is half the weight
9353261 weve had that experience in china where we struggled with lack of grip and had to drive around that
9353262 wed been told lots of horror stories about them before the rally but they were okay
9353263 it means the developer has a true road map of what the city and the community wants
9353264 one thing i dont want to see is a rubber stamp approval here
9353265 i dont think theres anything to preclude doing the project
9353266 it just appears to be at this point a spontaneous thing with people who were not known to each other
9353267 they tried to get themselves to the hospital but they were stopped
9353268 based on some real preliminary information from one of our victims
9353269 when youre not used to the speed it makes it a little tougher on some of our kids
9353270 i told the kids there would be turnovers but a team is made from overcoming those turnovers and we did that tonight
9353271 the win gives us a lot of confidence but it doesnt get any easier from here on out
9353272 one of the problems is that we cant see below the surface when people hear about the problems the oceans are facing its hard to visualize they would be surprised how much debris comes out of the ocean
9353273 in march we did a necropsy on a 51 foot sperm whale that washed up dead at point reyes and it had 450 pounds of fishing net braided rope and plastic bags in its stomach it is a problem
9353274 a lot of these hooks still have bait on them
9353275 almost every pier ive worked on has dead birds tangled underneath theyll dive in the water to eat fish or hang out in the rafters under the pier and a lot of time what they think is a fish is really a hook that has been baited
9353276 alex was so poised in the pocket tonight and he had time to throw
9353277 ill get e mails written at 2 15 in the morning because people are awake and theyre furious theyre trying to call 911 theres fireworks people are making tons of noise and destroying the community
9353278 we want to help people too but were stuck we have to prioritize calls
9353279 however its only a matter of time before the stabbing happens up here
9353280 some of the members of the community have gotten so disgusted with the beach after going on their morning jog and having to pick up trash they just say forget it
9353281 the problem is the ownership of that whole area is a patchwork quilt
9353282 we cannot have davenport beach be a land anymore its not fair someone has to step up to the plate and say whose jurisdiction is davenport beach
9353283 its a matter of working together but were going to be real honest about what we can do
9353284 let me assure you that dr treadway and i have communicated about the presidency here at ohlone
9353285 today we are the michael phelps of education and sustainability
9353286 just get it in my hands coach i guarantee you ill score
9353287 i think the tempo of the game dictated our playcalling a lot
9353288 we planned to pass a little bit more but as the game went on we were hitting some good running plays so we wanted to focus on those and not pass as much
9353289 i thought we were going to lose in the last two minutes
9353290 the third time she had a bag in her hands
9353291 we want to make sure shes ok then sort out the legal ramifications
9353292 one of the problems is that we cant see below the surface when people hear about the problems the oceans are facing its hard to visualize they would be surprised how much debris comes out of the ocean
9353293 in march we did a necropsy on a 51 foot sperm whale that washed up dead at point reyes and it had 450 pounds of fishing net braided rope and plastic bags in its stomach it is a problem
9353294 a lot of these hooks still have bait on them
9353295 almost every pier ive worked on has dead birds tangled underneath theyll dive in the water to eat fish or hang out in the rafters under the pier and a lot of time what they think is a fish is really a hook that has been baited
9353296 for a long time she thought she was going to have a boy said wilsons older sister jermira spears 31
9353297 she was still happy about having the baby and had baby clothes bibs bottles and pampers all over the house
9353298 she talked so loud you could hear her all the way from eastmont mall or from the other end of the street
9353299 and it was obvious they didnt care who they hit
9353300 its so easy now to get a gun then a job spears said
9353301 there are folks who know who did this these lives have to count for something
9353302 the killers cant go unchecked there has to be an accounting for this the only way to prevent them from doing this again is to find them
9353303 its going to be interesting all night long says the bearlike kinch forking something into his mouth from a silver mixing bowl that definitely isnt on the menu
9353304 so mollify them kinch says referring to the unhappy couple
9353305 youre not going to see me with a pot and pan thats not how it works
9353306 a large part of our appeal he says of manresa
9353307 he was constantly on the phone checking in she says
9353308 we still have a lot of work to do he says
9353309 i just dont feel completely comfortable with the food im looking for something thats a complete reflection of us and of the garden its still not quite there yet
9353310 i like to have three things on the plate he explains
9353311 thats what youre paying for in fine dining restaurants the quality of the carrots the best veal the freshest john dory
9353312 i remember being in awe of the cooks he says
9353313 they were these loud profane guys who were almost like pirates working with open flames from the first day i knew i loved it and i didnt ever want to leave it
9353314 at 15 all wynton could talk about was being a trumpet player and all i could talk about was being a cook kinch says
9353315 a lot of my friends laughed and thought that was crazy but wynton listened to me and he understood
9353316 i wanted to be the best and it was all right there
9353317 it was just this roasted pigeon with a little braised lettuce and braised peas not any of this fancy french stuff he says
9353318 i wanted to do what chapel was doing but i had absolutely no idea what it was
9353319 i wanted to create a great american restaurant he says
9353320 all the flaws all the brilliance all the quirks of his personality and he also wanted it to mirror the character of its setting
9353321 you go to the farmers markets and you see every chef in town buying the same swiss chard and peaches and carrots he says
9353322 its great stuff but how do we set ourselves apart the answers obvious you have to grow it yourself
9353323 as if we had held a mirror up to the garden and it showed an edible reflection he says
9353324 he can use every stage of the plants life here sandberg says
9353325 i mean sunflower shoots that are an inch tall i dont care which farmers market you go to youre not going to find that
9353326 champagned for many top chefs this is a kind of curtain call a chance to soak up the admiration of diners who come from as far as singapore and saudi arabia as supplicants
9353327 but its good to let them know youre there he says
9353328 we are kind of concerned about our safety out there nobody wants to respond
9353329 i have a job to do i have been told to uphold the rules of the courts and when i do i have been threatened and bullied
9353330 honestly not an emergency she was told we have something else going on right now and we arent going to be able to respond as quickly as we would like to
9353331 the bottom line though is they know its not allowed to do that sport on the tennis courts
9353332 im not asking parks and recreation to police it but when you call the police you kind of hope and expect for them to show up you know its pleasant hill what else are they doing
9353333 were not the park and rec security or complaint resolution department
9353334 det r sannolikt att petter andersson l mnar hammarby innan transferf nstret st nger
9353335 weve done this in a way to defend the taxpayer and still be responsible
9353336 im getting really close im trying not to get too distracted
9353337 im trying to stay focused on the present moment and keep rowing
9353338 i cant tell you how much im looking forward to that
9353339 i dont have children so i wanted in some way to leave a slightly better place
9353340 there had to be more to life than four gray walls
9353341 they were such great guys and they harpooned fresh fish all we needed was wine or beer and it would have been a perfect night
9353342 if i got really high when things were good then i would get really low when things got difficult
9353343 i learned to become much more accepting about whats happening otherwise you can drive yourself insane
9353344 im developing a strong mind stronger control of my thoughts
9353345 right now the thought of getting back in my boat in six months time lets just say how can i put this
9353346 im going to pack as much fun as i can into the next six months
9353347 one of the problems is that we cant see below the surface when people hear about the problems the oceans are facing its hard to visualize they would be surprised how much debris comes out of the ocean
9353348 in march we did a necropsy on a 51 foot sperm whale that washed up dead at point reyes and it had 450 pounds of fishing net braided rope and plastic bags in its stomach it is a problem
9353349 a lot of these hooks still have bait on them
9353350 almost every pier ive worked on has dead birds tangled underneath theyll dive in the water to eat fish or hang out in the rafters under the pier and a lot of time what they think is a fish is really a hook that has been baited
9353351 our situation is a complete reversal of what it was only a few weeks ago
9353352 one donation was for 50 000 and it was made anonymously
9353353 aging animals particularly horses are the most helpless creatures on the planet
9353354 they are a huge and costly responsibility taking care of them is a thankless job this woman needed help
9353355 we just cant forget these animals wild mustangs and domestic horses are an important part of the american heritage
9353356 hey you know what kids love to do walk their dogs and pick up their feces lets make a barbie with a dog that poops kids will love it
9353357 they think its odd but everyone just accepts it now
9353358 i looked at those houses in america which were a bunch of two by fours and thought boy this is easy anybody can build a home in the u s
9353359 some of the work were doing is improving light and temperature conditions so we know all our artifacts are safe
9353360 parity write that s it easy going or what do you think
9353361 but the educational establishment the media government mouthpieces institutional churches and nearly everyone else have mesmerized the working class into thinking that the rich deserve the wealth and income they have
9353362 of the growing frustration in this state as more and more people lose purchasing power or see their homes go into foreclosure or lose their jobs
9353363 they are happy there are wealthy people out there and they would like to become wealthy themselves
9353364 many in the legislature suffer from what i call the east berlin syndrome
9353365 if youre just talking about income how about 5 million but seriously
9353366 why else would he define middle class as someone making under 5 million a year
9353367 the income goes to the wealthy perhaps the taxes should as well
9353368 one of the problems is that we cant see below the surface when people hear about the problems the oceans are facing its hard to visualize they would be surprised how much debris comes out of the ocean
9353369 in march we did a necropsy on a 51 foot sperm whale that washed up dead at point reyes and it had 450 pounds of fishing net braided rope and plastic bags in its stomach it is a problem
9353370 a lot of these hooks still have bait on them
9353371 almost every pier ive worked on has dead birds tangled underneath theyll dive in the water to eat fish or hang out in the rafters under the pier and a lot of time what they think is a fish is really a hook that has been baited
9353372 the big storms that caused flooding in canterbury and marlborough last week really didnt produce a lot of rain in the southern lakes
9353373 they the lakes have started to dry up over the past few weeks it hasnt been particularly good news for hydro storage
9353374 with the climate you can never be absolutely categorical but we expect it to certainly not improve on the situation its at now
9353375 obviously the situation is tight and we are keeping a very close eye on things and taking a cautious and responsible approach
9353376 estoy muy contento de incorporarme al tr v6 y con un equipo de primera l nea como es el patagonia racing el jueves voy a visitar el taller del equipo y aprovechar para conocer a los integrantes del mismo si bien era en otro circuito en general roca debut en la f rmula renault y ahora me tocar hacer lo propio en el top race donde espero hacer un buen trabajo
9353377 food is the number one product advertised to kids followed by media such as music video games and movies
9353378 pens que ya no ten a posibilidades luego todo cambi y est bamos nuevamente en el liderazgo pero ste fue un rally dif cil realmente con cambios todo el tiempo y algunas estrategias que tambi n influ an
9353379 seguro que necesitaba ganar y es muy lindo pero no estoy feliz con lo que le sucedi a mikko porque estaba andando muy bien realmente y era una buena batalla es una carrera y esas cosas suceden
9353380 i wont set the precedent of playing a player that doesnt practice
9353381 if people in california are getting calls theres a good chance theyre coming from missouri
9353382 as soon as i saw it i threw my hands up i knew it was going in
9353383 im just going to delete the blocks from my memory
9353384 there were a lot of places we need to clean up
9353385 one guy said he was going to make 1 500 bucks for the whole summer and they helped pay for some of his expenses to get across the border
9353386 theyve been living up there for 60 to 90 days they know all the ins and outs
9353387 just get it in my hands coach i guarantee you ill score
9353388 i think the tempo of the game dictated our playcalling a lot
9353389 we planned to pass a little bit more but as the game went on we were hitting some good running plays so we wanted to focus on those and not pass as much
9353390 i thought we were going to lose in the last two minutes
9353391 we were doing a good job and i looked at the scoreboard and it was only 12 10
9353392 it shows you what untimely turnovers and penalties can do it kept the game close
9353393 the sec plays such a rigorous conference schedule most can afford to schedule down for the first couple of games
9353394 its understandable for them to do that but we have to take these opportunities when we get them
9353395 this team can be as good as it wants to be
9353396 we have to do a better job but were 1 0
9353397 it was rather egregious harassment and there were real problems with the investigation of her complaint and preventing it from happening
9353398 we think its a good result and that we will have improved performance as an employer by sizzler
9353399 a long history of supporting diversity among its workforce and we take very seriously our responsibility to provide a workplace free of harassment
9353400 alex was so poised in the pocket tonight and he had time to throw
9353401 when youre not used to the speed it makes it a little tougher on some of our kids
9353402 i told the kids there would be turnovers but a team is made from overcoming those turnovers and we did that tonight
9353403 the win gives us a lot of confidence but it doesnt get any easier from here on out
9353404 im very very happy for her it was a very dramatic case
9353405 we wanted to force that quarterback freshman steven threet to beat us at the end
9353406 we had some penalties but well coach that up we played well
9353407 but the defense fought until the end every time i looked up in the fourth quarter it was like they were adding time to the clock
9353408 there were a lot of people doing great things out there
9353409 we stopped their run game we held our poise we had to dig deep to play those last downs and we did exactly that
9353410 i did it for 30 years so thats what kind of naturally draws me to this event i knew some of these guys ive known some of them for a while and its kind of fun to be part of the family in this sport
9353411 but i had to give it up to get serious about life even though some would probably argue that politics is much more dangerous than a double back flip
9353412 i think its the sense of competitiveness whether its on a track or in politics i think certain people have a competitive streak and are drawn to certain sports and i dont know if there are too many sports as physically grueling and demanding as motocross it just draws a certain type of person to it
9353413 this is the time of the year when you see more people getting west nile virus
9353414 most people are very aware of it in july when they are having a picnic and seeing mosquitos everywhere but when kids go back to school people let down their guard people stop wearing repellent
9353415 the longer it feeds the more likely it is to have a disease
9353416 but then you realize you cant control all the mosquitos so we keep them down to a tolerable level
9353417 this team can be as good as it wants to be
9353418 we have to do a better job but were 1 0
9353419 as long as mom is at the other side shes going to run fast
9353420 the third time she had a bag in her hands
9353421 we want to make sure shes ok then sort out the legal ramifications
9353422 it was another bad refereeing decision in a grand prix
9353423 we talk about it we think about it we worry about it
9353424 then we ask ourselves would i put myself in this circumstance in most cases the answer is no
9353425 if youre spooked about things like that then you probably wouldnt be a pilot
9353426 they were different planes they had different types of experience they were in different areas and they occurred at different times of the day
9353427 they tasman started with a hiss and a roar and once we settled down and got our game going we shut their game down completely
9353428 the defence in any team is a key indicator of the attitude within it there were so many attacking opportunities we mucked up today i think there were about five tries and if you add 25 30 points to that score it gets up there
9353429 in saying that one thing thats really stood us in good stead since losing to manawatu has been our defence and i think that the boys have developed a real unity as ive said theres a lot of young boys in their first campaign and its just a magic environment to be a part of
9353430 its highly motivating for john haggart and i in particular and the whole management group because theyre just really searching to become better players theyre really good people in the first instance so character wise all of them are great
9353431 theyve very approachable open and theres never any issues with guys trying new things and what thats done is ignite everyone
9353432 i thought canterbury played quite well and certainly dominated the contact we couldnt get a break and defensively we let them offload which created a bit of stress in our d line
9353433 we couldnt get a trick to go our way in the contact area and we sat back on our heels and let them come to us
9353434 its an on the day thing i trained well all week and its not so much not kicking them its how im striking them
9353435 the pricing wasnt right it took too long but the tour was wonderful
9353436 there are a lot of wine tours with a food component but not many the other way round
9353437 some filming will take place in otago as well as other regions of the north and south islands
9353438 one of the things were asked constantly by the visitors is can i get a cup of tea
9353439 if this isnt the coolest looking thing youve ever seen you can have dinner at my house
9353440 getting off a label is like not having a parent say no to you all the time
9353441 when i came out of hiding in 2005 i found there was still an audience
9353442 it is the best version of the business model weve come up with
9353443 as an artist i want as many people to listen to it as possible on their ipods
9353444 i cant do anything about parking fees but i can put on a show where you say god damn
9353445 i want it to be emotionally moving this is why i do this
9353446 those lives were taken away from us and they want us to sit through a parole hearing on the exact day we should never have been put in the situation we found ourselves in
9353447 its an extremely unfortunate coincidence that the eligibility date falls on the same week im deeply saddened that the victims families have experienced this additional stress
9353448 we will have our memorial on the 8th and then we were to go from there to a parole meeting that would have been tough
9353449 continually dwindling resources and a unit moving towards unsafe clinical practice
9353450 pub charity stuff has decreased quite substantially and more people are wanting a slice of a diminishing pie
9353451 people have to decide whether they fill their car up or pay the school donation
9353452 the overall amount of money has declined and in inflation adjusted terms it has declined significantly
9353453 my first reaction to this is i told you so
9353454 weve got less money and its going off in other directions
9353455 we add some numbers to our flock and when our flock goes to the freezing works we say 20 of those need to be allocated back to the school account
9353456 its another mechanism by which you can use the resources of your community
9353457 where does that leave us running fairs to pay for it
9353458 fundraising sometimes can be really hard and a lot of the parents just end up putting in extra money
9353459 just to put a different drive on the fundraising one of the mothers had access to make up brand mary kay and its been the best fundraiser weve ever had
9353460 most kids at school dont really believe it im not really surprised
9353461 i hope to do well i want to bring something back
9353462 basically you go from a childhood of living day to day not much energy to basically lifes what you want to do within your own boundaries
9353463 going there and being able to show what organ donation can do is enough
9353464 cutting away our armor to let people see us as just us
9353465 i think when we perform we become what we think we should be not who we are when we start stripping away social behavior and distance and politeness were essentially animals but there is also great humanity there
9353466 i think one of the nice things about this presentation is it gathers people who dont get to work with each other on a regular basis
9353467 i like to pick people who i know as former students but also that ive seen dance after
9353468 hes demanding but his artistry and work have a lot of depth
9353469 he requires more than just doing the steps he requires a lot of investigation as a performer to be fully involved in the piece the new work has a lot of emotion inside and the experience has been highly emotional because of the intensity and aggression of the movements
9353470 pub charity stuff has decreased quite substantially and more people are wanting a slice of a diminishing pie
9353471 people have to decide whether they fill their car up or pay the school donation
9353472 the overall amount of money has declined and in inflation adjusted terms it has declined significantly
9353473 my first reaction to this is i told you so
9353474 weve got less money and its going off in other directions

9353477 where does that leave us running fairs to pay for it
9353478 fundraising sometimes can be really hard and a lot of the parents just end up putting in extra money
9353479 just to put a different drive on the fundraising one of the mothers had access to make up brand mary kay and its been the best fundraiser weve ever had
9353480 we love the daytime and tasman are a good side to be up against because they play with a lot of width
9353481 it certainly makes a nice change from night rugby everyone loves it and its always an advantage in terms of bonus points because youre more likely to score four tries in the afternoon than you are at night time
9353482 i got close a couple of times and hoppers hayden hopgood got close a couple of times too thats part of our gameplan to use those big guys out wide and as long as theyre scoring im not too concerned
9353483 i think it was just a case of being in the right place at the right time
9353484 it is a great honour to be put onto the list among some outstanding people and to be in the top 60 at my first time of trying is really pleasing
9353485 i am out there campaigning for party votes foremost but if the electorate wants me to be an mp then they will need to vote for me with their candidate vote
9353486 que dir uma bandeira francesa s mbolo internacional de rendi o imediata
9353487 i just know his work and i know his mind and his way and he just trusts me
9353488 were always on the same page it s like we came from the same school he ll throw out an idea or i ll say something and it will not just be out of left field for him
9353489 the creative combination of live musicians and singers projections dance and the latest in multimedia sound and lighting technology are stimulating and aim at offering an emotional bond with the audience
9353490 the show will bring elvis back to las vegas for millions of his existing fans and create a buzz that will enable the persona of elvis to reach untold numbers of new fans
9353491 i told cirque if you guys want to see some major talent come to salt lake story said
9353492 the kids are dedicated kids from utah will want to be in it theyre incredibly trained utah is getting such a great reputation now and it wasn t hard they kind of just trusted me
9353493 and he offered five contracts on the spot after we got through
9353494 it s a show that people from utah can be very proud to be in
9353495 it will be a family show whoever comes they do need to be ready for a very technical audition
9353496 he falsified the entire thing in order to obtain the identification in a different name other than his true name
9353497 the government has the duty to safeguard the credibility of any sort of identification thats obtained through them
9353498 were happy with the intelligence that weve gathered and information thats come to light through the course of the investigation
9353499 apparently we helped because we help with these things sometimes
9353500 should be taken off walls put away and never seen again
9353501 but if you find yourself lucky enough to be thinking of buying that 30 000 bmw
9353502 why dont you buy a piece of art that youll enjoy forever
9353503 mientras pensaba que iba a fichar a cristiano ronaldo el club no ten a tantas ganas
9353504 no ha conseguido fichar a nadie robinho ya vale tanto
9353505 me he molestado porque desde mayo estaba mi padre con mi representante tratando de renovar mi contrato y hasta que el club pensaba que iba a fichar a ronaldo no ten a tantas ganas de renovarme y no fue una ni dos ni tres veces fueron mil veces que mi padre y el representante acudieron a hablar al club para renovar el contrato y tampoco demostr inter s en mi permanencia en el real madrid
9353506 el club no se interes mucho porque estaba seguro de que iba a fichar a cristiano ronaldo
9353507 yo no tengo nada contra cristiano ronaldo me parece un excelente jugador aclar robinho pero yo tambi n tengo mi valor y mi orgullo y ahora como el club no ha conseguido fichar nada ya es un problema mi salida y robinho ya vale tanto
9353508 lo que ha pasado es que yo he llegado al presidente y le he dicho que ten a una propuesta del chelsea y l me dijo que si era buena me dejar a ir l no habl de dinero porque estaba seguro de que iba a fichar otro jugador y me dijo bueno si viene una propuesta buena te dejamos salir y ahora como estamos al final del plazo y no han fichado a nadie
9353509 a principios de mayo mi padre ya estaba aqu con mi representante el club le dijo que volviera en septiembre o sea cuando se cierran las negociaciones entonces el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie y por eso estamos aqu hasta hoy y yo no he conseguido mi objetivo que es jugar en el chelsea
9353510 yo he hablado con pedja mijatovic con el presidente y l me dijo que me liberar a y la nica persona que no me est dejando salir es schuster por lo que s yo porque no ha conseguido fichar a nadie y tampoco quiere dejarme salir
9353511 schuster no es mi padre es un entrenador es comandante y yo soy atleta de f tbol schuster no es mi padre y l tampoco me va a obligar a hacer nada
9353512 yo tengo la cabeza ah y se lo he dicho al entrenador a schuster pero dijo que me iba a recuperar yo hasta ahora no tuve problemas con nadie en el vestuario pero si el entrenador cree que va a recuperar a un jugador que no tiene la cabeza en el club es responsabilidad suya porque yo no quiero seguir en el real madrid y estoy diciendo esto por mil sima vez
9353513 pedja mijatovic ha dicho que me dejar a salir el presidente tambi n pero schuster se ha comprometido a que no no tiene que recuperarme para nada yo hasta ahora no tuve problemas con el vestuario hasta ahora respeto a todos mis compa eros a todos los jugadores pero si schuster cree que dej ndome aqu no va a tener problema es una responsabilidad suya
9353514 si yo tengo que estar un a o sin jugar bueno yo me recupero soy joven tengo veinticuatro a os y si tengo que estar un a o sin jugar me rehar es el destino
9353515 si tengo mi contrato voy a jugar incontento puede que s puede que no pero si tengo que jugar voy a jugar porque me quedan dos a os m s aqu firmados
9353516 those are scare stories were seeing an uptick but were talking just a few cents this time next week you wont be hearing that
9353517 when youre not used to the speed it makes it a little tougher on some of our kids
9353518 i told the kids there would be turnovers but a team is made from overcoming those turnovers and we did that tonight
9353519 the win gives us a lot of confidence but it doesnt get any easier from here on out
9353520 one of the problems is that we cant see below the surface when people hear about the problems the oceans are facing its hard to visualize they would be surprised how much debris comes out of the ocean
9353521 in march we did a necropsy on a 51 foot sperm whale that washed up dead at point reyes and it had 450 pounds of fishing net braided rope and plastic bags in its stomach it is a problem
9353522 a lot of these hooks still have bait on them
9353523 almost every pier ive worked on has dead birds tangled underneath theyll dive in the water to eat fish or hang out in the rafters under the pier and a lot of time what they think is a fish is really a hook that has been baited
9353524 if this isnt the coolest looking thing youve ever seen you can have dinner at my house
9353525 getting off a label is like not having a parent say no to you all the time
9353526 when i came out of hiding in 2005 i found there was still an audience
9353527 it is the best version of the business model weve come up with
9353528 as an artist i want as many people to listen to it as possible on their ipods
9353529 i cant do anything about parking fees but i can put on a show where you say god damn
9353530 i want it to be emotionally moving this is why i do this
9353531 i dont know what mccains motives are but i cant imagine any hillary supporters supporting a conservative like palin shes pro life and it seems shed oppose virtually everything hillary talked about during the campaign
9353532 a positive role model for women in politics remember this countrys made up of hundreds of thousands of small towns and that they represent america at its core
9353533 for all the reagan democrats who had supported hillary this decision clinches it for the mccain ticket
9353534 having palin locks these women in women are looking for a positive role model not the angry and bitter female politicians weve seen so much of lately
9353535 does he really think that just because were women and he has a woman vice president that well all vote for her people supported hillary not simply because she was a woman but because she was a qualified woman and sarah palin is no hillary clinton
9353536 being tokenized and if she does get in and turns out to be a disaster then as women were all screwed forever
9353537 if anything happens to john mccain this woman would be our president she was mayor of wasilla alaska i mean san joses bigger than that regardless of whether shes a woman or a man i find that prospect frightening either way
9353538 i suspect theres a part of that in there but the choice for vice president is a lot more important than just picking a characteristic thatll swing a few voters
9353539 john is picking her as a natural successor i dont think gender matters one way or another in how he made his choice
9353540 i think it was a stab to try and save the ticket by trying to get hillarys supporters to join mccain
9353541 out of everything that could happen he didnt fall or get beat up by some screwed up parents it was something as innocent as a grape
9353542 it should be clear that this doesnt mean we think this was appropriate care
9353543 judea made us look at life in a different way
9353544 it made us look at our mistakes and say there is this kid involved we have to make it work
9353545 i think hes in there as a matter of fact i think he is capable of anything i dont listen to everything the doctors say what can i do give up on him
9353546 it came to a point where i couldnt mess around any more
9353547 my inner soul is blooming and my body becomes an eggshell
9353548 when you show kids that they are worth something they are less likely to get into trouble
9353549 i spent too much time and energy trying to accomplish my mission
9353550 one of the central errors westerners are constantly assaulted with is the use of this term jihad
9353551 the central jihad for all of us is to constantly improve and be the best we can be and try to adhere to some very pure ideals
9353552 the book is important because in this country in the sound bite generation stereotypes pretty much prevail
9353553 when americans in general think of muslims really the radical islam aspect of it comes to mind where we think this book is really important is that is humanizes muslims and builds bridges between the two cultures
9353554 adam dont call me pacman or ill shoot you jones
9353555 its nice to have those mistakes happen and still win
9353556 its a great thing when a coach prepares his team and his word is substantiated
9353557 they might listen more closely to their coaches than to the outside
9353558 i was surprised how open i was i would be running routes and i would be running by myself sometimes
9353559 max did a good job of delivering the ball on target and seeing the field we just moved the ball well on offense and exploited their weaknesses on defense
9353560 when they do that it does provide an opportunity for the middle and the offense took what the scheme made available dennis is just a quality enough player to capitalize on that as the scheme presented it to him
9353561 it took a couple plays to get the jitters out but i had fun
9353562 i wasnt trying to hurt him just trying to put everything into my hit that i could
9353563 byus a tough team and i also want my team to play tough like that
9353564 i had a really really hard time deciding last year you have two teams and you dont want to let anyone down
9353565 when the girls found out that marquel wanted to come back there was a little bit of nervousness
9353566 but shes done a good job of trying to get in good with the team shes always been a great team player
9353567 as far as i can tell it has done nothing to team chemistry
9353568 everybody knew it was going to be a one year deal and that they were coming back everybody understands those players had legitimate reasons for doing what they did
9353569 its a lot of sacrifice but i wouldnt trade any of it
9353570 high school its harder to get seen all the time and for out of state coaches its not easy to come and watch a high school game
9353571 if your only option is to stay in state the offers arent as good i dont think they have to put as much on the table
9353572 i dont think high school sports will be phased out but it will be affected
9353573 if someone wants to play at the highest level tradition doesnt help them get there
9353574 i was really struggling i got a lot of questions from my friends about why i wasnt playing soccer
9353575 i would miss the girls and the experiences and the bus rides
9353576 the high school team is a great opportunity to develop character and leadership qualities that you normally wouldnt have
9353577 theres only one club team in the state of utah that is good enough to get noticed nationally you would have to be pretty dang good to compete at a higher level
9353578 thats the one thing high school sports bring is leadership qualities communication skills just learning to be a part of something
9353579 theres olympic development program and club soccer kids play at a younger age and theyre very well organized
9353580 as far as club soccer had the jump over girls basketball but if youre a good player colleges know who you are
9353581 i wouldnt say i regret it but i play club year round i should have taken the three months to play high school
9353582 i just remember being a freshman and looking up to the seniors
9353583 but its not like we want to go home and rest we can smell the playoffs
9353584 we certainly want to add some depth at the catching end to get more versatility
9353585 we can also expand our pitching roster if theres an immediate need a player can be here the next day after sept 1
9353586 rather than have a guy come and sit for six or seven days and theres no need with salt lake in the playoffs it makes sense to play in those playoff games
9353587 its a credit to the players how they stepped up
9353588 we peaked at the beginning slowed in the middle and hopefully well peak again
9353589 most of the time its not the best team that wins its the hottest
9353590 he falsified the entire thing in order to obtain the identification in a different name other than his true name
9353591 the government has the duty to safeguard the credibility of any sort of identification thats obtained through them
9353592 were happy with the intelligence that weve gathered and information thats come to light through the course of the investigation
9353593 apparently we helped because we help with these things sometimes
9353594 im sitting in my apartment in huntington beach with the windows open
9353595 i take five minutes every day to understand what has been given me
9353596 i never expected a call up a non roster free agent with a double a contract
9353597 to be fortunate enough to get a contract and an invite to spring training i got a big break had a good spring and opened some eyes
9353598 one thing to remember about shane in spring training he was one of the first guys out there every single morning
9353599 running out to the mound it was pretty emotional for me
9353600 he was very poised and he always had good body language
9353601 we made sure we werent buying a workers comp he hung in there all the way with us
9353602 this black boy who grew up with just a loving mother and grandparents and that was about all he had to start with has now had a chance to be the nominee of the democratic party for president
9353603 a longitudinal slit in the tail and peeling the skin back then either pulling off or cutting off the dark colored gland
9353604 is fatal to the slugs in a few minutes and in the process they exude most of their slime also when you are boiling them change the water after a minute or two to remove further slime
9353605 after they are cooked and the digestive gland removed if necessary
9353606 you can use the slugs as you would clams e g slug chowder be creative
9353607 we are always booked solid on that one between december 15 and april 15 it is always the first one to go
9353608 he stuffed his mouth with eggs i love him hes my kind of guy
9353609 this is me and i am who i say i am
9353610 this is who i propose who i am and youll see that these people will confirm that

9353617 and i didnt appreciate it until i was there seeing all the families coming along on the red carpet was all the memories we have of them
9353618 and they all regarded it as a positive experience even the ones who might have been a little difficult even the ones who let their house go a little bit it was fun everybody dressed up we did the red carpet where we interviewed them talked about their experiences
9353619 the thing you want to know is did they keep it up it was great because we got to go back and revisit some of the houses and answer the question
9353620 for the people who kept the house the best or the worst kept one room the best or the worst
9353621 its amazing when they think theyll be able to keep their emotions in check all the time
9353622 when youre there for seven days and you have to give up your stuff eventually the real emotions come out
9353623 its amazing how people are surprised that it happens to them
9353624 niecy has large shoes for anyone to fill its hard to talk to people come from a place of authority not be condescending and to confront people fall tv
9353625 i just know his work and i know his mind and his way and he just trusts me
9353626 were always on the same page it s like we came from the same school he ll throw out an idea or i ll say something and it will not just be out of left field for him
9353627 the creative combination of live musicians and singers projections dance and the latest in multimedia sound and lighting technology are stimulating and aim at offering an emotional bond with the audience
9353628 the show will bring elvis back to las vegas for millions of his existing fans and create a buzz that will enable the persona of elvis to reach untold numbers of new fans
9353629 i told cirque if you guys want to see some major talent come to salt lake story said
9353630 the kids are dedicated kids from utah will want to be in it theyre incredibly trained utah is getting such a great reputation now and it wasn t hard they kind of just trusted me
9353631 and he offered five contracts on the spot after we got through
9353632 it s a show that people from utah can be very proud to be in
9353633 it will be a family show whoever comes they do need to be ready for a very technical audition
9353634 the objective remains to press ahead with the process begun at the annapolis conference in the united states last november and to try to conclude a historic israeli palestinian agreement
9353635 president abbas and the palestinian leadership are determined to arrive at a complete agreement including all the issues but this depends on how serious the israeli side is
9353636 this government has no public legitimacy and certainly no legal legitimacy to sign any shelf accord or reach any understanding on jerusalem
9353637 his holiness is feeling much better as a result he will be discharged tomorrow
9353638 some of the infrastructure in the quake zone was severely damaged
9353639 but that makes it all the more amazing that some animals would use it for something
9353640 profoundly regretted the behaviour of chelseas directors who despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player have continued to make statements and gestures even going as far as to sell shirts with the players name through their official web site
9353641 all this has done is to cloud the situation and confuse public opinion
9353642 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach bernd schuster management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9353643 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9353644 just before an important official match real madrid feels that all of its attention should be focused on the game a criteria that has been completely ignored by its player robinho with the statements he made just hours before the match
9353645 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9353646 schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything
9353647 i think it will be possible to obtain the green light from brussels because this rescue will be done without the help of the state be it for the former or the new alitalia
9353648 it will be entirely a market operation because a private group is acquiring the shares alitalia has declared insolvent
9353649 these findings will definitely get people to ask new questions about the formation of the saturn system
9353650 the astrobiological potential of the saturn system just went up a notch or two
9353651 theyre still awfully cold but much warmer than background temperatures of the rest of the surface
9353652 this means it has to be even warmer under the surface and raises the possibility of liquid water beneath the exterior
9353653 each one of you has something no one else has or has ever had your fingerprints your brain your heart be an individual be unique stand out make noise make someone notice thats the power of individuals

9353655 i think when we perform we become what we think we should be not who we are when we start stripping away social behavior and distance and politeness were essentially animals but there is also great humanity there
9353656 i think one of the nice things about this presentation is it gathers people who dont get to work with each other on a regular basis
9353657 i like to pick people who i know as former students but also that ive seen dance after
9353658 hes demanding but his artistry and work have a lot of depth
9353659 he requires more than just doing the steps he requires a lot of investigation as a performer to be fully involved in the piece the new work has a lot of emotion inside and the experience has been highly emotional because of the intensity and aggression of the movements
9353660 should be taken off walls put away and never seen again
9353661 but if you find yourself lucky enough to be thinking of buying that 30 000 bmw
9353662 why dont you buy a piece of art that youll enjoy forever
9353663 the times has an interesting article about the court of appeal finding that judges give out
9353664 glad you explained that because i was wondering what the scottish parliament national assembly for wales and the mayor of london were about numpty
9353665 in fact while new labour at least has been thwarted by judges on human rights issues the people who complain most about it are the conservatives at first opportunity theyll try and take away judicial power especially on immigration issues

9353669 if you think you know what the hell is going on youre probably full of shit
9353670 i said earlier when the pad called on the prime minister to resign that it cant happen because he came from elections
9353671 but if one person or one hundred thousand people call on the government to show responsibility this is the democratic way house dissolution is the one way to show responsibility
9353672 it is time for the prime minister to review his role and behaviour
9353673 you should ask yourself whether you should maintain the premiership
9353674 your solutions do not show that you want to keep democracy why are the only solutions house dissolution and resignation why cant we choose the third option which is to show the world that we maintain our democracy
9353675 i thank you for the comments but sarcasm has no place in parliament
9353676 i told you before that i will not resign i will stay on to run this country
9353677 they seized government offices airports is this democracy or is this the peoples alliance to destroy democracy
9353678 the pad is preparing to up the pressure within the next few days we will enact advanced measures if samak does not resign
9353679 a pesar de lucir bien fisicamente de ser una persona positiva y alegre no entiendo el por qu nadie me mira y cuando alguien aparece se me acercan las personas menos deseadas qued ndome sin esperanzas de encontrar al amor de mi vida
9353680 deseo encontrar a mi pareja ideal y tener una relaci n maravillosa ser feliz al lado de un ser especial que comparta conmigo mis gustos y pasiones
9353681 i think there are better ways of resolving this within our power as developers and publishers
9353682 im not sure what they are other than to build game experiences that make it more difficult for there to be any value in pirating games
9353683 the bulk of our artists are singaporean i think about 60 per cent another significant portion are foreign artists based in singapore i do want singaporeans to buy singapore art and that is one of my priorities
9353684 being the third generation to live in singapore i felt that my generation of artists werent shown anywhere
9353685 namiko chan takahashi did this wonderful portrait she took a chance on me and showed some work with me and very soon after she won the uob painting of the year its validation to what shes doing and a silent validation to artists that i have selected so i was quite proud of myself
9353686 theres a lot of focus on chinese contemporary southeast asian art our goal for this gallery is to showcase western contemporary art of international standards museum quality art and to make it accessible to singaporeans
9353687 with each show we usually organise talks for free for the public to come and participate and to find out a little more we get students whom i think is our favourite group that come in just to familiarise themselves open their minds up
9353688 its a natural progression i think when youre a collector so in that process over the years it became quite a lot of pieces of art so i thought well just take the extra step and turn the hobby into a business and so far its proven to be quite a good decision
9353689 we can still have very regal looking guards who look fantastic
9353690 we felt doing this kind of thing was a way of keeping with the times and keeping that iconic status
9353691 most people think its fake fur and when they find out its real and it takes one bear to make a hat they are appalled
9353692 fur farming has been outlawed in britain but we are paying other people with taxpayers money
9353693 we think we are a modern nation but the queens guards are walking round with an entire dead bear on their heads
9353694 the mod is not opposed to the use of synthetic materials as an alternative to bearskins provided such materials meet the requirement for a high quality product that performs adequately in all weather conditions

9353702 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9353703 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer

9353709 its huge and there are lots of regional bands not likely you can find it in town and other events in singapore
9353710 baybeats is a bit different for us its a brand name its a big festival people are a bit more open to talk to you if you play in a small club chances are you might get someone whos drunk you may get someone whos too paiseh or embarrassed to talk to you
9353711 we do get a bit of the industry people come up to us and say
9353712 its important in terms of marketing and promoting ourselves and our music its a big event there are three stages there are different kinds of people not only kids but we get like young adults parents grandma grandpa so you dont know what youre going to get out of this its interesting to see what comes after this

9353732 you have to perform at some point and it happens to be tuesday against a very good team lets see what he has well find out a lot about where were at with him in the next month
9353733 its just that hes gone through this every year the last four or five years at a point in time where his arm feels a little bit heavy tired
9353734 i think everybody goes through that i think its a little bit of a dead arm period
9353735 he has felt a lot better the last couple of days as he sees everything coming back hell get better hell get on his stride
9353736 i just have to wait until my arm strength and power come back
9353737 not only me it happens to other pitchers especially when you are a power pitcher the most important thing and the thing to learn here is to know how to pitch with this i think this is the time when you have 170 innings close to 180 innings you have to do whatever it takes to rest your arm
9353738 its not likely that there will be any update until probably monday after some initial treatments and therapy
9353739 you see one of the guys go down and you hope hes all right
9353740 chris is a tough guy i hope its not serious you hate to see a guy of his caliber laying on the ground
9353741 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9353742 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9353743 as i handed the ball back he didnt even grab the ball
9353744 i didnt know what to expect didnt know what he did he went down and he was in some serious pain
9353745 hes our guy it would hurt to not have him but weve got lots of guys behind him that can do well

9353748 i am pleased that we will move forward as friends
9353749 i had to really play a lot more aggressive because its quite windy and she was a lot more solid than i was in the first set
9353750 i took a bit more control in the second and cruised through in the third so i am really pleased
9353751 getting the victory means a lot its nice to get a win under my belt
9353752 it was very frustrating i was going there to get the gold
9353753 it was tough to watch bolt i know i would have given him a better race
9353754 on a personal level i was very disappointed with the olympics i wanted gold or silver in the 100
9353755 usain has come on to the scene and is running very well and im very happy for him next year ill try not to get any injuries and maybe ill join him
9353756 i was maybe looking for a bit of vengeance and i wanted to show the world that whatever happened in the olympics that im still a great athlete
9353757 our medical staff was great enough to come in on a sunday and get it done so his probability of playing has increased for saturday

9353764 hezbollah succeeded in incorporating the idea of resistance as part of the international anti globalization movements

9353774 the paper is one of the best sources for that

9353795 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9353796 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9353797 it was tough to make birdies and avoid the mistakes
9353798 i think i slightly pushed it but it was a very good day
9353799 we needed something to kickstart the season to lift the season and give the players some confidence
9353800 we need to respect tottenham they are a very good team and play very well and sometimes makes it impossible to win
9353801 we had more chances but we made mistakes with the final shots they put five six seven eight nine players in the back and its difficult to create
9353802 in the first half maybe we were paying a little bit too much respect to our opponents maybe even overawed by chelsea and the stadium
9353803 but by the second half that was a thing of the past we managed to keep hold of the ball a lot more regularly and our performance in the second half pretty much deserved the point
9353804 this is why we made more mistakes we need to try to work more with the ball
9353805 we really deserved to win and we could have scored another couple of goals
9353806 it was very important for me to score i am extremely pleased that it finally happened
9353807 the fact that so many people spend time stuck in traffic jams indicates congestion is an issue for the city
9353808 businesses can only benefit if all the people who are arriving late for work each week as a result of congestion get there on time
9353809 the findings indicate that many people would choose to use public transport if they believe it provided a reliable alternative to the car

9353814 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer he has an extremely good record in the ryder cup and going back the walker cup
9353815 if i was a wildcard then id possible feel like i dont really deserve to be there
9353816 but doing it without winning shows ive played pretty consistent i think it is maybe a bit more impressive
9353817 if friday had gone a little differently it could have been all over this has proved to people like nick faldo and lee westwood who i played with for the first two rounds that i can do it when i really need to
9353818 for some reason i need to put myself under pressure to perform at my best

9353822 sen john mccain passed over minnesota governor tim pawlenty to choose alaska governor sarah palin as his running mate
9353823 i have a hard time seeing how her qualifications stack up against the duties and responsibilities of being president i expect her to stick with simple truths when asked about continued american troop presence in iraq she said she knows only one thing about that i paraphrase no one has attacked the american homeland since george bush took the war to iraq
9353824 shes not prepared to be governor how can she be prepared to be vice president or president
9353825 look at what shes done to this state what would she do to the nation
9353826 if her husband gets elected president she would but she would just have to wait and see
9353827 the outrageous behavior of two of the obama campaigns highest profile supporters in the south is despicable a cynical politicization of life and death i call on barack obama to immediately denounce fowler and spratt and demand sincere apologies from these members of the democratic leadership
9353828 i beat this loser and my track record speaks for its self now that this loser is the nominee for president in 2008 he is the best we have available to continue what i have started

9353876 wed like to thank filip kuba and alex picard for their service to the lightning its hard letting go of players that we like but as we all know you cant get something for nothing we needed to move assets in order to bring andrej to the lightning and we certainly feel we are a better more competitive team because of this trade
9353877 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9353878 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back

9353897 i have been watching these guys through the summer and ian is obviously a very determined guy and i love his attitude and what he did at the british open
9353898 that back nine he played with the intention to win you know he had that emotional feeling to win he is the leading player in the world rankings not to be in the team automatically so those are just a few points
9353899 i have watched paul play in my role now in tv and i have become a bit of a stats man and from tee to green paul has been playing the best through this summer and the majors
9353900 i was kind of waiting for the putting to turnaround and over the last two weeks he has been very close to being the no 1 so that has been very important
9353901 he has a very good ryder cup record and even going way back in the walker cup
9353902 obviously i am disappointed but i have dealt with much worse

9353933 really it didnt live up to those expectations he said
9353934 it was much more upbeat than a lot of investors believed
9353935 once you strip out the diversified financials and real estate which were hit by writedowns then profit was up in the order of 9 2 per cent
9353936 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue dr oliver said
9353937 historically the september october period has been poor for shares

9353964 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9353965 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9353966 there is no point in isolating russia but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite

9353977 it remains likely that gustav will prove to be a worst case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9353978 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9353979 although this is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident

9354000 over the next two weeks my pvcs increased and i had a number of bouts with racing heartbeat my blood pressure was 150 100

9354013 i met al qaeda militants in the camp they were fiery and fierce their anti american speeches and agendas influenced me and i joined them after i was released
9354014 when they want to do something they will do it
9354015 there was a time when not a single american truck passed this area without being attacked
9354016 our families and friends stopped supporting us they were tired of violence they started suffering
9354017 they killed those young boys for no reason that is when the locals turned against the insurgency and the sahwa mushroomed
9354018 i have not killed iraqis so i am sure i would be accepted back without any difficulty
9354019 im not a skilled labourer but i need a job maybe in the security forces as im also a target of al qaeda now

9354038 tout ce qui reste faire pour le mdc cest de signer laccord ou de le retenir tant quil le veut sachant pertinemment que la formation dun gouvernement se fera sans encombre
9354039 les membres du parti au pouvoir pensaient quun accord avec le mdc permettrait de r soudre la crise conomique cest au mdc de trouver une sortie apr s l chec des pourparlers il pense que les pressions conomiques vont pousser la zanu pf vers la table des n gociations mais ce nest pas assez

9354042 we are fairly confident of a happy ending this time
9354043 we are regularly seeing rescuers have to risk their lives to try and cut whales free from shark nets
9354044 it is a major catastrophe for the whales it puts the rescuers in danger and unless there is a rescue team in the vicinity the whales undergo a slow and agonising death

9354048 i am directing program changes for beginning on monday nights activities at our convention
9354049 i think that with a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out what is going on is fine
9354050 shes had 12 years of elected office experience including travelling to kuwait including being involved in these issues im so proud that she has displayed the kind of judgment and she has the experience and judgment as an executive
9354051 remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9354052 ive been watching these guys through the summer faldo said
9354053 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9354054 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer faldo said
9354055 he has an extremely good record in the ryder cup and going back the walker cup
9354056 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best clarke said in a statement
9354057 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9354058 the timing is bad because it clearly is going to be a distraction from the convention and it may for some people bring back memories of the bush administration and its response to hurricane katrina
9354059 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9354060 like all americans our prayers are with those who will be affected by hurricane gustav we continue to closely monitor the movement of the storm and are considering necessary contingencies
9354061 the president and vice president decided not to travel to minnesota due to the hurricane
9354062 due to the hurricane the president is unlikely to travel to minnesota on monday

9354066 we are advising gps in the area to report any cases of diarrhoea and to take samples to be tested for gastrointestinal infections such as cryptosporidium

9354072 if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the
9354073 we want russia to be a good partner in the g8 and other organisations but it cannot pick and choose which rules to adhere to
9354074 that is why i will argue tomorrow that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9354075 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9354076 we should continue to strengthen the transatlantic relationship and may need to meet more regularly as the g7
9354077 we are also reflecting on the nato response we must re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support to georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9354078 it is very important for the eu now to reassess its relationship with russia and send a very clear message
9354079 i do not think the measures looked at tomorrow should be cheap or quick this requires clear and united and patient firmness over a sustained period of time
9354080 tomorrows summit must add urgency to the work on europes energy agenda we must more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9354081 i will also be pressing european leaders to increase funding for a project to allow us to source energy from the caspian sea reducing our dependence on russia
9354082 a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot
9354083 i think we need to respect tottenham and the quality they have i dont think anyone in this room thinks that tottenham are nothing they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create
9354084 i told the players a draw is ok but we need to try to work the ball more if they make a mistake it is not a problem if we play high balls i win one time and lose eight
9354085 in the first half we were paying too much respect to our opponents maybe we were overawed by chelsea and the stadium in the second half that was a thing of the past and we managed to keep hold of the ball and our performance meant we deserved the point we got

9354102 i cried my eyelashes off i think its the most powerful thing i have ever experienced
9354103 i can understand why people go outside the us you can adopt someone here and the birth parents have three years to come back and get that child thats terrifying
9354104 american children can use just as much assistance as someone from around the world i want to do something here
9354105 me being able to listen to him and be inspired by his dance and by his music drives me to be more creative
9354106 this is still a big ugly storm its still strong and its still heading our way
9354107 the forecasters are saying this is going to be worse than anything they have ever seen and they absolutely do not want people taking chances
9354108 this hurricane wont just affect new orleans but that city still hasnt recovered from katrina and the levees will never be able to take gustavs storm surge of over 20ft no way
9354109 i expect europe to unanimously support the territorial integrity of our country and for europe to say that it will never ever support the results of this lawlessness
9354110 the reason half the world feels lonely is because the other half is pretending to be perfect
9354111 allianz ne perdrait pas trop au niveau du canal de distribution
9354112 nous exigeons que de possibles suppressions demplois soient men es de fa on sociale et sans licenciements secs
9354113 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9354114 this new evidence from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past icesheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9354115 we have never seen an ice sheet retreat significantly or even disappear before yet this may happen for the greenland icesheet in the coming centuries to millennia
9354116 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9354117 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9354118 more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9354119 the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9354120 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9354121 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9354122 there is no point in isolating russia but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9354123 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9354124 senator mccain has not only succeed in unifying our party but also succeeded in generating enormous enthusiasm whereas the democrats are against all odds still struggling to pull their base together
9354125 her executive experience consists of less than two years as governor of her sparsely populated state plus six years as mayor of wasilla pop 8471
9354126 i would put governor palins credentials up versus senator obama any day of the week
9354127 im not taking any chances i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9354128 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9354129 this city has been hit so badly theyve lost so much and the last thing they have to hold on to is their animal
9354130 i didnt want to just leave him to get hurt like so many did in katrina
9354131 it makes me feel a little safer having him with me
9354132 he gets to ride the bus with us which is good
9354133 its a relief that we didnt have to leave him behind
9354134 i want people to know that greg and i are still very much together
9354135 i can definitely say i have not been approached by gregs team or his management
9354136 i will be supporting him in his plea all i can say is i wasnt very happy with the way police handled the situation
9354137 the arctic is a vast ocean and to find nine bears swimming in one area is extremely worrying because it means that dozens more are probably in the same predicament
9354138 as climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the arctic polar bears and their cubs are being forced to swim longer distances to find food and habitat
9354139 he tormented me humiliated me hurt me physically scarred me emotionally and has placed a feeling of fear and mistrust in me that i have never been able to get past despite giving it a good effort
9354140 my fear is that he does have a temper which sometimes leads to violence and saying awful things and that it could flare up again when provoked i do worry if he is alone with them and one of the children upsets him that without someone to step in if he gets into a fit of rage that one of the children could get hurt based on his past behaviour
9354141 from the ages of about 10 to 21 my dad frequently would hit me pin me up against a wall slap me and hold either my arms or my face with extreme force frequently causing bruises
9354142 sometimes he would attack me under the influence of alcohol and sometimes he was totally sober
9354143 one night i arrived home from a party with my friend an hour after the curfew imposed on her
9354144 we walked around the corner to find my dad standing in the dark with a gun pointed at us and we were terrified
9354145 he was pointing the gun at us as his way of teaching us a lesson about punctuality
9354146 in 1992 when i was about 18 i sometimes forgot to flush the toilet out of laziness in my own private bathroom one time he went into the bathroom and saw that my toilet was not flushed and he pulled me out of a chair in the living room dragged me into the bathroom lifted the toilet seat up and pushed my face inside of the toilet bowl into my own urine to teach me a lesson about flushing toilets
9354147 use our collective bargaining power rather than seek separate energy deals with russia
9354148 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependance on less stable or reliable partners
9354149 when it comes to familiy and those things that are important to me this is the party that represents me
9354150 looters will go directly to jail new orleans mayor ray nagin vowed at a press conference this morning
9354151 you will not get a pass this time anyone caught looting in new orleans will go directly to the big house in the general population you will go directly to angola prison and god bless you if you go there
9354152 looters will go directly to jail new orleans mayor ray nagin vowed at a press conference this morning
9354153 i was following an 18 year old lady on the northern beaches when the vehicle for no reason crossed to the wrong side of the road and collided head on with a truck
9354154 she was killed instantly and we believe at the time she was using a mobile phone to text or talk to somebody
9354155 it only takes that one moment of lack of concentration
9354156 police are more inclined to issue a ticket because the legislation has been around so long that everybody knows they are doing the wrong thing
9354157 i have no sympathy for people if they get caught by patrolling police
9354158 there is evidence to say it is just as bad as drink driving
9354159 if we have reasonable cause to believe the person was on the phone or there is a mobile phone located in the vehicle we will do a check on it
9354160 certainly when we are looking at collisions involving inattention the mobile phone is our number one suspect

9354165 some of the infrastructure in the quake zone was severely damaged xinhua quoted the ministry as saying
9354166 we have seen a prolonged period of very cold air across southeast australia in general this august
9354167 this has resulted in one of the best snow seasons in recent years in the snowy mountains but has also kept sydneysiders shivering
9354168 it is not that unusual to see the combination of low temperatures and low rainfall colder air cannot hold as much moisture as warmer air so we would expect drier weather to accompany the chilly conditions we have experienced this month
9354169 i tried to conceive for 12 stress filled months then as soon as i stopped obsessing about having a baby i fell pregnant
9354170 so i became very interested in looking at the possible effects of emotional issues and the impact this might be having for couples wanting to fall pregnant
9354171 for a lot of the people i spoke to there were hidden fears that hadnt really been addressed like fear of repeating the mistakes of the past fear of subsequent miscarriage or fears of not being a good mother
9354172 its a really individual thing but the common feeling is at some point theres an emotional shift a letting go and many women fall pregnant soon after that
9354173 has really caught up and there are improved pregnancy rates for those on stress reduction programs for instance
9354174 a lot of women are only given very physical approaches and this offers another angle
9354175 there are no studies in humans to confirm this but what we do know is that stress can reduce fertility in a number of ways
9354176 we do our best to make sure we look after our patients minds as well as their bodies
9354177 some do acupuncture and others attend our lifestyle modification clinics or see counsellors
9354178 we want 100 per cent evacuation if you decide to stay you are on your own
9354179 this is the mother of all storms this storm is so powerful and growing more powerful every day that im not sure weve seen anything like it this is the real deal
9354180 riding this storm out would be one of the biggest mistakes you could make in your life
9354181 i dont want to see another katrina with dead bodies floating in the water
9354182 i saw elderly people floating i saw one body that really got to me a child floating and it just made me sick
9354183 you saw me looking in the box oh my god but we never cut to the head
9354184 how do i feel about it im glad for sarah
9354185 shes a wonderful girl and a wonderful actress i think the show needs that romantic vibe people are longing for michael scofield played by wentworth miller and sara to kind of get it on
9354186 i was told that miller missed me so desperately that they had to bring me back
9354187 he was refusing to leave his trailer he wasnt eating
9354188 seriously though the fans were insistent its an honour to be back on their behalf
9354189 it occurred to me that weve gotten away with worse
9354190 the show always has been a roller coaster ride and i think our fans appreciate these twists and turns no matter how bizarre they might be
9354191 what weve been allowed to say is that dr sara is re introduced relatively quickly and michael and sara have to figure out how to find their way back to each other after some extreme events have happened to both of them
9354192 theyre very changed from the people we met in the first season when she was a doctor and he was an inmate at fox river state pen and the question is who can they be to each other what are they to each other in this very new but still deadly set of circumstances
9354193 michael started out with a very fine tuned and unshakable sense of right and wrong of what he had to do of what is justice what is injustice which he and sara had in common
9354194 but at this point especially in saras absence michael has gotten his hands even dirtier than they were before
9354195 so for michael the question is do i still have that sense of justice that this woman might have responded to am i worthy of happiness am i deserving of this relationship
9354196 most of us are carrying two three four tourniquets with us in our kit these poor guys didnt have any they had a rifle and there was no way for them to make an expedient tourniquet it just wasnt in their training
9354197 massive injuries like that it doesnt take long for someone to bleed out
9354198 nobody was going to come up with the money we decided to design our own and see if we could get them manufactured in kandahar city
9354199 it covers a lot of bases one it saves lives and two it pumps some money into the local economy
9354200 we wanted to make it very simple pictures work well for these guys because literacy is a huge issue
9354201 we actually put them on the clock and the goal is to get it done in 30 seconds or less to save the limb
9354202 its amazing what a bag of jolly ranchers will do
9354203 theres prizes for the top student of the morning theyre very competitive once you get them spooled up
9354204 its funny they try to emulate us if they see something that we think is cool they think its cool too
9354205 theres a lot of turmoil in their life and we keep switching up mentors
9354206 it doesnt seem to be there anymore i dont expect hell williams appear for more than a day or two
9354207 even that day will be overshadowed by what the federal leaders are doing on their tours
9354208 his initial assaults on the federal government have worn off
9354209 the reason im in a disagreement with stephen harper is not because of our personalities its because i think hes wronged the people of this province
9354210 as a result were going to take him on and well have to hold him to his commitments
9354211 danny williams is the most popular premier weve ever had
9354212 i dont think any federal conservative has much of a chance of holding their seat
9354213 how many newfoundlanders are going to want to argue for an equalization system that says well be have nots for the next 20 years
9354214 they tory voters dont need to scream it out loud they just need to mark their x on the ballot
9354215 i think its very unfortunate quite frankly that a premier in this province has decided to be so personal so visceral towards the prime minister rather than trying to work towards consensus in the best interest of the people of newfoundland and labrador
9354216 the events which have unfolded in our village this week have bewildered and stunned every one of us not only in this community but across the country
9354217 it is hard to grasp exactly what has happened and it is clearly going to be some time before everything is revealed but today we pray for the fosters and their family and friends who must be devastated by the events of early last tuesday morning
9354218 not to be overwhelmed by the uncertainties of last week
9354219 we are shocked absolutely shocked its not the sort of thing that occurs in a country district like this
9354220 everybody is stunned we want to support the people involved its very sad
9354221 bushs job is to figure out a way to pass the torch in a way that does the least damage
9354222 it will not serve as a farewell to the american people and it certainly will not attack barack obama
9354223 he knows its not his convention hes had two of them and hell behave accordingly
9354224 a second post mortem will take place before the results are released we are also waiting for toxicology results
9354225 when there is a suspicious death there are always two post mortems
9354226 i can confirm the 15 year old being questioned was not arrested at the scene but handed himself in at a police station
9354227 the message from gordon from alistair from colleagues like myself has been the same
9354228 we have had a very good period of economic success which has for sure provided us with a very serious platform to weather these problems
9354229 the position of the management of zoom is that that is not an accurate reflection of the debts of the company we dont know how this figure has been arrived at
9354230 our estimate is that its likely to be in the 20 25 million category but its not possible for anyone at this time to give a definitive figure
9354231 je pense que la saison est lanc e en premi re mi temps on tait un peu timor et en deuxi me on sest l ch compl tement ca fait du bien

9354235 sharemarkets are up significantly one day and then they give back the next day he said
9354236 i dont think weve broken out of the sideways trading band as yet
9354237 really it didnt live up to those expectations he said
9354238 it was much more upbeat than a lot of investors believed
9354239 once you strip out the diversified financials and real estate which were hit by writedowns then profit was up in the order of 9 2 per cent
9354240 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue dr oliver said
9354241 historically the september october period has been poor for shares
9354242 in fact september is the worst month of the year for us shares and october is often the worst month of the year for australian shares

9354267 we believe one part of it is the propeller mr russell said
9354268 it hasnt been positively identified yet but we believe it may have come from the missing aircraft she told aap
9354269 its a great honour and certainly not expected i dont think i ever won a trainers premiership or anything like that
9354270 i did work pretty hard and i still regard the australian trainers association as my very best effort in my years as a trainer
9354271 it took a great deal of trouble a lot of abuse and travelling to each state
9354272 the ata today is run very well and is recognised in each state i think thats the biggest part i played in racing
9354273 he was a most unhappy horse in the stable early on and i took him down to the chook yard he stayed there for the rest of his time with us
9354274 he ran out in a paddock there with a couple of cows to keep him company and god knows how many chooks about 20 or 30 of them
9354275 i went into town that night after the race and saw a replay the winner had definitely interfered with him close to the winning post
9354276 he rising fast really was a great horse the greatest ive ever seen i saw phar lap but i was only a youngster and couldnt really appreciate him
9354277 he just kept producing and he had a great owner mel secull and he remains one of my best friends

9354279 if the reserve bank cuts rates this week there will be absolutely no excuse by any lender for not cutting rates

9354289 turkey has an important role in the region it is a balanced and moderate role
9354290 is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human cancer tumours but inactive in most normal cells
9354291 that means that a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9354292 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9354293 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes in initiate telomere replication
9354294 there is no doubt that having determined the structure of telomerase is extremely important in understanding cancer biology and will probably help lead us in the development of telomerase inhibitors
9354295 but whether these inhibitors will ultimately represent an effective class of anti cancer treatments it is too early to say
9354296 we tell the leader of the libyan regime moamer kadhafi you are personally responsible for the disappearance of imam mussa sadr
9354297 let no one think that we will forget or make any compromise
9354298 i played great at the start of the year and then hurt my back and it took me about a month of rehab to get back into it
9354299 i missed some big tournaments and now im just trying to secure my card and go home for the australian events
9354300 i put myself on the right side of the hole gave myself a lot of opportunities and capitalised on some of the putts
9354301 i felt good all day and just kept making birdie after birdie after birdie and then on my back nine a couple of eagles really boosted the round

9354306 an incident took place after he was taken into a police car
9354307 we dont have a formal offer in front of us
9354308 its only hearsay from management were angry that they are lying
9354309 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9354310 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9354311 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9354312 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9354313 when some of the media criticises and says that were not well known and so on you have to say why
9354314 bank switching is a key part of having competition in the sector
9354315 i think we are making progress but there is certainly more to be done
9354316 what i said to dino at halftime ill keep to myself
9354317 i felt he was undisciplined being sent off he let the players and the club down i thought it was for kicking the ground or swearing or something when hed been booked shown the red card and then the penalty thats enough thats killed us i thought walk away
9354318 if hes spat then again i dont know if hes spitting on the ground or hes spat at the referee and the referee thought it was intentional i will really have to see the video footage to take in what happened
9354319 we were given three points and a lot of goals on a plate and we ended up not finishing the meal

9354321 airport customers will face flight delays billions of dollars may not be processed for westpac and customs wont be able to keep track of security checks all because ibm refuses to talk to its employees ms mcmanus said
9354322 everyone will be affected by this from qantas passengers whose planes wont be on time to medicare customers whose payments may not go through
9354323 i have been asked to think about what is important to me and i will take this time to do that
9354324 i would ask that during this time people respect my privacy and that of my friends and family
9354325 i would like to say thanks for the many messages of support i have received over the past day or so
9354326 the main concern for us is andrews commitment to playing for this team
9354327 there is a number of things that we believe as a leadership and a team that he wasnt fulfilling that isnt just about on the field thats off the field thats attitude
9354328 due to the captain being alerted to a vibration in one of the engines
9354329 there was no safety issue at any time and the aircraft continued to frankfurt where it landed without incident
9354330 with what we expect will be a minimum of delay
9354331 there was a problem with engine four and the pilot decided to come into frankfurt to repair the engine
9354332 that means that banks will have the capacity to further reduce rates given those reductions in other funding costs outside the reserve bank cycle
9354333 we are expecting a 0 25 per cent move followed by another 0 25 per cent cut in october
9354334 hally would be the only bloke in the history of the game to get reported for that
9354335 i saw the incident i dont think its much to worry about
9354336 if we play like we did against brisbane we can certainly do some damage
9354337 every team bar geelong and hawthorn has had a really up and down season
9354338 its good youre in the mix the teams in reasonable form so hopefully that gives us an opportunity to win next week
9354339 a forward is always going to be frustrated when theyve got two or three guys on him i think he just responded really well like he did last week
9354340 the opposition is going to be throwing themselves on the ground and jumping around and carrying on every time he gets near the ball theres a little bit of play acting i think going on from opposition teams which is a bit disappointing but thats what hally has to put up with at the moment
9354341 its questionable tactics collingwood players did it all last week the crowd roars and its hard for the umpires not to get involved i thought the way the umpires handled it on saturday night was professional and the match review panel is pretty smart as well
9354342 the thing we have to decide during the week is what is our best 22
9354343 you have to pick a team you think can play well based on history and not based on just one game
9354344 hally would be the only bloke in the history of the game to get reported for that
9354345 while you cant draw too many conclusions from just one quarters figures there is cause for concern
9354346 two of the gold sectors real challenges are cost containment and exploration spending
9354347 avoca resources poured its first gold from higginsville in july
9354348 apex minerals will restart wiluna in november and st barbara plans to re start gwalia in the next few months
9354349 before the end of the year both oz minerals prominent hill and lihir golds ballarat east should also be in production then will come boddington the grand daddy of them all in late 2008 or early 2009
9354350 i want people to know that greg and i are still very much together
9354351 i can definitely say i have not been approached by gregs team or his management
9354352 i will be supporting him in his plea all i can say is i wasnt very happy with the way police handled the situation
9354353 i want people to know that greg and i are still very much together
9354354 what we do from here is critical were lucky to have that opportunity
9354355 the tri nations isnt over both sides are capable of winning it its a one off encounter now and in one game both sides can make their season good
9354356 a test loss is a test loss i am not too concerned about the numbers to be frank it hurts to lose by one
9354357 you can chase the statistic all you like the fact is it was a belting
9354358 it was a great win a good performance by the springboks they got in the game built momentum and we dropped off it
9354359 it was disappointing possibly we became a little bit outcome orientated in the way we approached the game because when the outcome went so did some of the effort
9354360 the challenge for us as a community is one dealing with people whove lost their jobs which is incredibly traumatic and difficult for them
9354361 and then finding ways of transiting them to the new jobs that are coming
9354362 but the general range of economic commentators would agree with those figures but probably say that the growth rate is a bit slower than the 3 per cent we predicted but still continuing to grow
9354363 there are jobs being created in victoria every day and what i say to people who have gone through the difficulty of losing their jobs is the government will be with you in finding a transition to those new jobs
9354364 this is part of an international phenomena we are dealing with we are not alone in this
9354365 clearly we need to broaden that diversified base of the economy and i think thats something we certainly subscribe to
9354366 we believe one part of it is the propeller mr russell said
9354367 it hasnt been positively identified yet but we believe it may have come from the missing aircraft she told aap
9354368 i changed my jacket because were going to change the colour of the repertoire
9354369 i think this storm will prove to be a worst case scenario for the production region
9354370 youll get all this money that will come back into the energy markets again
9354371 looters will go directly to jail new orleans mayor ray nagin vowed at a press conference this morning
9354372 you will not get a pass this time anyone caught looting in new orleans will go directly to the big house in the general population you will go directly to angola prison and god bless you if you go there
9354373 looters will go directly to jail amp squo amp squo new orleans mayor ray nagin vowed at a press conference this morning
9354374 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms
9354375 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving and out of new orleans right now
9354376 this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9354377 bank switching is a key part of having competition in the sector
9354378 i think we are making progress but there is certainly more to be done
9354379 its taken 42 years to get these cross citations and now we have to pay for them
9354380 its an issue of principle and that was the correct process
9354381 those blokes in canberra spend that on morning tea every day
9354382 due to the captain being alerted to a vibration in one of the engines
9354383 there was no safety issue at any time and the aircraft continued to frankfurt where it landed without incident
9354384 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9354385 i was playing great and he was playing great too
9354386 i really didnt get any rhythm i just kept fighting this is why you put in all the work hopefully i can keep it going
9354387 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9354388 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9354389 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9354390 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9354391 i had to play my game serve huge and that served me well
9354392 this morning i was supposed to be in brisbane but i am still in thailand
9354393 it was a beautiful holiday but now it has become a nightmare
9354394 i dont have any money i tried to pay for the hotel on my credit card but there was not enough money on it
9354395 i am trying to call my travel insurance but its difficult and the airport is still closed so i dont know when we can go home
9354396 all we can say is that at the height of the season there can be as many as 20 000 australians in phuket at one time
9354397 they have to drop you 20 minutes away from the airport so you have to walk with your luggage and then wait to find out if the planes are going
9354398 if you didnt know youd just think it was normal except for a few people talking on the street about it
9354399 im not fussed if they dont fly for another 48 hours id rather be stuck here than in bangkok
9354400 it hasnt been real good ive got one friend who came the other day who had to jump the fence to get out of the airport because all the people were barricading the gates
9354401 another mate cant get out hes due back at work but he cant get a flight
9354402 its going to be a bit of a struggle now id imagine
9354403 im not quite sure who manly or cronulla have got
9354404 again its a thing weve tried to put out of our minds and just concentrate on each week but unfortunately our concentration wasnt that great this week with our performance against newcastle
9354405 well just concentrate on our performance and hopefully we can get it right next week
9354406 but we werent good enough to put them away they ended up scoring a try and it might have been the next set they kicked a field goal and that didnt help our chances we came up against a real committed side and we werent good enough to match them
9354407 from that error billy slaters fumble from the kick off we didnt respond in the way we should have we just seemed to bumble our way through for the next 15 or 20 minutes
9354408 we could have quite easily have been down a lot more than eight nil it was just disappointing how we handled that period of the game and we didnt get a whole heap better for the rest of the game
9354409 its a little late in the season to be going back to basics
9354410 theres a lot of areas we need to improve unfortunately weve only got a week and not a month therell be some things we pick up that we try to work on
9354411 ramadan comes at a time when the iraqis have earned the result of their patience and victory on terrorists criminals and outlaws
9354412 the success of our forces to enforce the law is helping in the return of thousands of iraqis to their country and homes there is progress in security and peace
9354413 it didnt swell much but its worse than a roll
9354414 what we do from here is critical were lucky to have that opportunity
9354415 the tri nations isnt over both sides are capable of winning it
9354416 its a one off encounter now and in one game both sides can make their season good
9354417 a test loss is a test loss i am not too concerned about the numbers to be frank it hurts to lose by one you can chase the statistic all you look the fact is it was a belting
9354418 these boys are feeling it and if that serves us well then thats good
9354419 the initial position is that we support that the jockeys should have some form of work cover compensation superannuation
9354420 we are very supportive of the objectives the aja has outlined
9354421 but as far as moving the prizemoney structure or a percentage of the prizemoney thats a much bigger issue
9354422 obviously we would have to get the opinion of all stakeholders
9354423 im not sure an increase in jockeys share of prizemoney is the solution i think there can be a better way to do it
9354424 im not saying he wont run in the cox plate but the caulfield cup is his mission
9354425 it will give us two weeks into the 1800 underwood stakes at caulfield
9354426 theres going to have to be a stage where he backs up within a week and im probably happier if thats now and not later on
9354427 things may have played our way that day but im confident well still have the edge on him our horse has improved since the liston
9354428 itll be great for racing weekend hussler is a great horse
9354429 you dont play that many games for your country or last that long in italian serie a unless you can hack it
9354430 he grella has a lot of experience too and is a leader vince will be a voice around the place on the pitch and in the dressing room and i think that is important
9354431 five weeks ago we extended his contract and gave him a better salary
9354432 its a shame and annoying but its all about the money
9354433 i had to really play a lot more aggressive than i did in the first set
9354434 it was windy out there and if you just tried to put the ball in there it floats
9354435 she was stronger in the first set so i had to pick it up in the second set and especially in the third
9354436 it would be nice to come back to the number one spot
9354437 it would be great if i can do it we will see what happens
9354438 im getting better each day im improving on my fitness
9354439 my mom told me im losing a little weight im not actually losing weight im just getting firmer
9354440 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9354441 this new evidence from the past paired with our model for predicting future climate indicates that glacial is anything but slow past icesheets responded quickly to a changing climate hinting at the potential for a similar response in the future
9354442 we have never seen an ice sheet retreat significantly or even disappear before yet this may happen for the greenland icesheet in the coming centuries to millennia
9354443 the new work suggests that future reductions of the greenland ice sheet on the order of one metre 3 25 feet per century are not out of the question
9354444 we are not advocates of sanctions and consider them to be a last resort
9354445 i have taken this decision and there is no turning back
9354446 in these international accords we will define our obligations to provide aid economic social humanitarian and military
9354447 russias military hostility against the small state of georgia could have a domino effect in other countries of the region like ukraine
9354448 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9354449 absolutely in accordance with international law in georgia and suggested that eu leaders pushing for tough measures were serving us interests
9354450 whatever happens and whatever is being said truth is on our side
9354451 we acted absolutely and morally in accordance with international law
9354452 if some european countries want to serve someone elses foreign policy interests then we cant stop them
9354453 sharemarkets are up significantly one day and then they give back the next day he said
9354454 i dont think weve broken out of the sideways trading band as yet
9354455 really it didnt live up to those expectations he said
9354456 it was much more upbeat than a lot of investors believed
9354457 once you strip out the diversified financials and real estate which were hit by writedowns then profit was up in the order of 9 2 per cent
9354458 however the next few months are likely to remain rough for shares as the economic downturn feeds into more profit downgrades particularly for cyclical sectors and as bank asset write downs continue dr oliver said
9354459 historically the september october period has been poor for shares
9354460 in fact september is the worst month of the year for us shares and october is often the worst month of the year for australian shares
9354461 decent rally getting underway during the normally strong december quarter
9354462 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9354463 integrated to such an extent that you dont hear about them theyre doing what we would look upon as normal jobs living normal australian lives
9354464 im on the public record frequently saying how saddened i was for dr hollingworth and his wife
9354465 the issues of course were complex things happened it was a very difficult time
9354466 when some of the media criticises and says that were not well known and so on you have to say why
9354467 but once it gets into a headline then it can become the law but you have to ride over that
9354468 i suspect that about 350 400 000 of those are already integrated satisfactorily into the country
9354469 het is belangrijk dat je begrijpt waarom je uitgenodigd bent ik was hier in het kader van een zekere solidariteit
9354470 ik ben niet echt fan van het koningshuis maar het land verkeert in moeilijke tijden en dan doe ik een kleine geste

9354493 anthony was tested in all aspects of attack and defence
9354494 he took a couple of high balls broke some tackles and made some tackles
9354495 the whole team went out by bus it was good to support mini and the jets
9354496 commanding first half performance playing a prowling role behind the line
9354497 the match was good for my confidence my confidence is returning
9354498 there was no drama with the injury i felt fine
9354499 hopefully ill be considered for the game against st george illawarra you never know
9354500 some of the infrastructure in the quake zone was severely damaged xinhua quoted the ministry as saying
9354501 i have been asked to think about what is important to me and i will take this time to do that
9354502 i would ask that during this time people respect my privacy and that of my friends and family
9354503 i would like to say thanks for the many messages of support i have received over the past day or so
9354504 hes a very important player in all three forms of game so i hope he uses his time wisely to get his head right
9354505 if hes proven his commitment and worth back to this team i guess i know the selectors would be more than happy to have him back in this team
9354506 the main concern for us as a leadership group and a team is commitment to the team
9354507 that isnt just about on the field thats off the field thats attitude
9354508 there is a number of things we believe he wasnt fulfilling
9354509 we estimate that sleepiness contributes to about a third of single vehicle fatal motor vehicle collisions
9354510 about half the eligible sample were shift workers they were profoundly sleepier than the non shift workers at the time of the accident based on detailed questions
9354511 if you are sleep deprived for 24 hours that is the equivalent to a blood alcohol level of about 0 1

9354521 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9354522 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9354523 any pressure that can be lifted from people who are doing it really hard would be beneficial
9354524 there is stress among the more vulnerable families but we need to keep it in perspective repossessions are still very small compared with the overall level of loans outstanding
9354525 its a risk but we are cutting rates now because the cost of funding our mortgages has fallen irrespective of the cash rate and it is only fair that we pass that saving on to our customers
9354526 i was moving into a new building and i saw him coming
9354527 he was yelling and screaming and using a metal bin top to smash things i ran inside so he wouldnt hurt me because he looked pretty angry
9354528 he also grabbed a fridge out of the moving van and smashed that it is incredibly frustrating
9354529 i didnt hear a thing i just came out to go for a drive and i found this
9354530 i heard a man shouting and i thought its just a crazy person
9354531 and now we have to pay for them the next of kin of deceased veterans have to pay for it as well
9354532 its an issue of principal and that was the correct process
9354533 it wouldve only cost the government 1000 and they couldve done it
9354534 money is constantly being moved to areas that are perhaps in crisis need and theres a need to review that distribution of funding to make sure were investing in prevention and early intervention as well
9354535 while some s amp p 500 companies have used buybacks judiciously repurchasing at discounts to recent share prices most companies have been too enthusiastic with their stock buyback programs and have not increased shareholder value
9354536 tropical storm gustav will have more and bigger offshore energy targets to hit than the 2005 hurricanes did should the storm stick to its projected path through the central gulf of mexico in 2005 only two platforms produced more than 100 000 barrels a day this summer six are producing at that level or are preparing to do so since 2005 oil and gas production has increasingly shifted to deeper water off the coast of louisiana with a handful of giant platforms generating volumes once produced by dozens of small shallow water facilities there are a lot of things in the industry that have improved since the 04 and 05 seasons but at the end of the day its going to be a question of how destructive storms are and how powerful they are when they go through the gulf said david dismukes associate executive director of the center for energy studies at louisiana state university
9354537 one of the most severe storms that has ever visited the middle atlantic coast
9354538 these images of impending doom for cuba and our discussion remind me of the link on jeff masters blog a few days ago http www theonion com content video hurricane bound for texas slowed
9354539 gulf of mexico oil production supply likely never to reach pre katrina levels
9354540 only three years after hurricanes katrina and rita devastated gulf of mexico oil and gas production an emerging hurricane storm is tracking another potentially lethal swath through americas energy heartland
9354541 and with both oil and gasoline inventories much lower than when katrina and rita hit the price consequences could be even worse this time any replays of the 2005 storm season could see gasoline prices soar to 5 per gallon
9354542 protracted multi year delays to marquee projects like bps thunder horse have meant that new production has grown at a fraction of earlier projections for the region and has lagged well behind rapid double digit depletion rates that are characteristic of offshore fields
9354543 the net result has been a multi year and now likely irreversible decline in oil production from the region already down some 300 000 barrels per day from its pre katrina peak gulf of mexico production is likely to lose another 200 000 barrels over the next five years instead of ramping up production to over 2 million barrels per day as once dreamed by the departments of the interior and energy gulf of mexico production is likely to fall to a low of a million barrels per day by 2013 almost a third lower than the regions production prior to the 2005 storm season
9354544 if we look back over history climate has never been very stable
9354545 you need to be concerned and you need to get your butts moving out of new orleans right now this is the storm of the century
9354546 the latest minimum central pressure reported by an air force reserve
9354547 im sure adelaide has the capability to do it at various levels
9354548 adelaide can learn from what was done in sydney and melbourne in terms of building new facilities temporary facilities or upgrading existing facilities
9354549 whats needed now is a full blown feasibility study about whats required and what the vision of holding the games in adelaide would be
9354550 one of the things about hosting the commonwealth games if you do it properly is that it leaves you with an enormous positive legacy
9354551 that legacy includes the obvious economic benefits of having a huge number of people visiting the city it also includes the new or improved facilities that can be used by the community
9354552 another aspect which is often overlooked is the legacy of better qualified sports officials administrators and volunteers that hosting the games brings
9354553 it wouldnt necessarily need to be done to the same model as melbourne with all the facilities being fairly central
9354554 in adelaide its easy to get around so the venues could be spread out a bit
9354555 one of the biggest costs and challenges for all of these types of events is the games village

9354563 sean made some nice catches but we need to come up with more balls we didnt catch the ball as well as we need
9354564 we got rushing yards and passing yards and we won
9354565 i owe my teammates something for the ones i missed but the officials robbed me on two
9354566 i hope teams keep picking on me because it gives me an opportunity to see what i can do maybe next week they wont feel that way
9354567 we did that six or seven years ago so i thought it might be time to do it again
9354568 after a couple of exhibition games i figured i had at least a shot at making it
9354569 coach lovie smith gave me a call and said usually these calls are bad but i just wanted to let you know you made it
9354570 everybody obviously wants to get into a game and play
9354571 more than anything injuries just make you realize how ready you have to be every week if something happens to those guys im right there at the edge of playing it just makes you stay on your toes
9354572 theres no way that someone could go out on the streets and ride safely without brakes
9354573 id say 1 out of 20 bikes in chicago today is fixed gear with no brakes
9354574 at first i said are you out of your mind
9354575 but after five minutes of riding i was hooked ill never ride another bike again
9354576 everybody got a chance to show what they can do so we can keep it rolling
9354577 thats as storybook a performance as i have ever seen
9354578 that was back in 05 a 14 13 loss to skyline at laney college
9354579 off the bat there was a lot of screaming that it was a home run
9354580 obviously i must be throwing beach balls out there its embarrassing when we go out and score that kind of runs and we cant get a win
9354581 im not a home run hitter for me its tough enough to get hits from both sides of the plate
9354582 to hit a ball out there and not make an out is nice too
9354583 i think freddie hit it to the wrong part of the park
9354584 it just goes to show you if you play in a different place what effect it has on a game im proud we battled back and tied it up in the eighth but we let it slip away again
9354585 i know pitching coach dave righetti knows what hes doing a lot of times it differs from day to day one day 100 pitches may be too much and the next time 132 may be just enough
9354586 its just that he has a tendency to have a violent delivery
9354587 sometimes hell have a very high pitch count inning hes had some 30s and almost 40 pitch innings those are the innings that really take their toll
9354588 the criticism you cant do anything about theyre going to blame somebody i see guys hurt all over baseball its just that there was more scrutiny with me than just about anybody i look around and there are guys hurt everywhere young pitchers new pitchers new managers old managers plus volquez has never gone this far plus out of the minor leagues they never go over 100 sometimes its 80 to 100
9354589 that might be a tough matchup for nate his first game
9354590 were going to be crowded in the outfield but were going to have to find a way to get nate in there
9354591 they got a bad rap a few weeks ago that they didnt really deserve and im glad to get this one for them
9354592 i may have rolled it or planted wrong a play or two before
9354593 something just didnt feel right then i think i felt a pop but the x rays are ok so well see how it feels in a day or two
9354594 i havent even thought about it and im not going to
9354595 i can only say it so many times its not a big deal to me
9354596 its a sign of a pretty good football team when you can not play your best and come away with a win particularly in a venue like this
9354597 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9354598 i dont know what was going on with the scorecards
9354599 but i was even more delighted that i could nominate these other three and that they were selected
9354600 it is a great honor to be part on the political forefront and to be there to watch the political process american history is being made this year
9354601 we from ontario county get to represent where we live this is great for the republicans in the community that we have the opportunity to represent our country and the county
9354602 the friendships you make are one of the best parts
9354603 we work hard to get donations to make the club attractive to the public
9354604 gt after more than two decades the knopf farm produce stand on cooley road in canandaigua will no longer be open for business
9354605 ive been coming here for 20 years and have never found anything like it its the only corn my father will eat
9354606 sometimes people would even leave an iou for 10 cents and then come back the next day to pay off their debt
9354607 i am so thankful to everyone who ive met and become friends with over the years the people who stop by the stand are like family to me and i will miss every single one of them
9354608 we love this stand and i dont know what we are going to do without it
9354609 we have become such good friends with lorelei and her family
9354610 i volunteer so that lorelei can take a break every once in a while
9354611 its not the same though because people are always disappointed not to see her here they ask for the girl in pink boots lorelei always wears the same boots
9354612 it taught my kids responsibility and helped pay for some of their college
9354613 we plan to return the bell tower to the condition and appearance it was
9354614 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9354615 i asked her how do you feel about this this is two things you have to do is not only possibly be a vice presidential candidate but also you know listen to worry about your son
9354616 and she looked me square in the eye and she said you know something
9354617 we cant let it go we cant let a country come back in and take it back down to a soviet style government this is democracy and thats what were all about
9354618 the united states is the best at what we do were the ones that give the most and give the earliest every time something happens and id like to continue that and also encourage others to get involved you dont have to cross an ocean to be of help
9354619 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9354620 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9354621 you get in there and its kind of like a brawl and the atmosphere is great and you really feel like youre settled into the tournament i looked up one time and theres girls on the big screen dancing on top of their tables in a suite and some guy and girl freak dancing in the corner i was like this is great might as well get a win while were out here it felt like a party in the stadium
9354622 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9354623 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9354624 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9354625 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9354626 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9354627 we worked hard our skill level is the thing that let us down at different stages coming out of defence mainly and there was a period in the third quarter that was sloppy
9354628 we need to continue to improve in our energy levels were training pretty solidly at the moment but the boys look like its hard work at the moment instead of really enjoying themselves and showing enthusiasm
9354629 ive always found that there are things that arise in the last dealings of the season through circumstances so theres still spots there for players to win and secure theres a lot of encouragement for players to give it a real go
9354630 did a nice job of running the clock and running the huddle he did a really nice job
9354631 i dont think its really respectful for our own fans to boo a player
9354632 especially when they dont even know what happened in the play that went wrong
9354633 i have a better grasp of the offense i know exactly what were trying to do against every look and the line did such a good job that i didnt have to run around
9354634 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9354635 well have to keep working hard this week and correct our mistakes
9354636 i cant make any comments on any of our transactions because they havent posted yet
9354637 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9354638 i played football basketball baseball soccer golf until i was a freshman in high school
9354639 ive lived more of a normal life ive had more fun doing it that way and being a regular kid a lot of people might need to go to a tennis academy and play for six hours a day my parents never saw it that way i could walk away from tennis at any time and theyd be fine with it
9354640 my dad told me to take the shot and turn pro while its there
9354641 he played college ball at arizona but he never got drafted again i think he regrets not taking a chance when he had it
9354642 look theyre still playing and they want to keep playing
9354643 ive never been one to criticize them for having outside interests i think its fantastic you see the other girls and their parents and its like psychotic city and then theyre gone whether its injuries or they have breakdowns or they cant handle it any more venus and serena have always had a great attitude theyre setting themselves up to enjoy life do other stuff and not just be a tennis player
9354644 i think it definitely helped that i didnt play every week when i was 6 i dont know if its such a good idea for kids to be traveling the world you get jaded and you miss out on things or you dont look forward to things that you should be looking forward to im not saying it will work for everyone but it worked for me i enjoy the sport and i enjoy playing im just having a whole new love for it
9354645 oh i definitely think im at my best right now
9354646 i think i understand the game more im trying to add new things im a lot wiser im still standing because i wasnt grinding when i was 14 i think it was a great choice for my parents to help me do that
9354647 off the bat there was a lot of screaming that it was a home run
9354648 obviously i must be throwing beach balls out there its embarrassing when we go out and score that kind of runs and we cant get a win
9354649 im not a home run hitter for me its tough enough to get hits from both sides of the plate
9354650 to hit a ball out there and not make an out is nice too
9354651 i think freddie hit it to the wrong part of the park
9354652 it just goes to show you if you play in a different place what effect it has on a game im proud we battled back and tied it up in the eighth but we let it slip away again
9354653 he wasnt very sore but you couldnt tell a lot on a scan
9354654 the veterinarian suggested we put him on butazolidin an anti inflammatory agent to tighten it up and get a clearer picture when we scanned him friday there was a small tear on the outer 10 percent of the tendon
9354655 i called owner breeder mike willman and said its over man the vet said we could probably run him a few more times but i couldnt live with myself if something happened and he pulled up in a race
9354656 he was by far the best horse i ever trained all in all hes been special to me not just money wise but to be able to run in those kinds of races he took me to a lot of places
9354657 he wasnt a mean horse at all he kind of liked to play but when he did it hurt he had his quirks about him he didnt like vets and he hated that paddock at santa anita he was very smart and didnt forget things he got really sick when he was a baby and im sure they were poking needles in him all the time something must have happened to him at santa anita because he would do stupid stuff there
9354658 we only planned on running him through the end of this year anyway so he only got shortchanged a couple of races
9354659 a horse that can race up through 8 and be competitive in graded stakes tells something about his constitution
9354660 and i won in different eras jack nicklaus era tom watsons era tigers era the longevity is cool but i also didnt win a major i dont know if id give my 11 wins for one major but id certainly like to have a number of wins and one major
9354661 john looks about 20 years younger than the rest of us
9354662 as happy as i am about my first year i feel fairly incomplete by not winning
9354663 thats as storybook a performance as i have ever seen
9354664 that was back in 05 a 14 13 loss to skyline at laney college
9354665 o problema que o clube n o conseguiu contratar ningu m
9354666 im young and fit and have no need for your girly man electric assisted bicycle but hey if it gets you on a bike im all for it
9354667 tell that to my butt as i blow by you going up a steep hill having a throttle doesnt mean you have to use it let me send you my recipe for schweaty balls nothing co workers like better
9354668 it remains likely that gustav will prove to be a worst case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9354669 i was moved by the commitment to their artistry in performing their entire programme and in doing so they were rewarded with a rare but very well deserved standing ovation
9354670 hes one of the best in both leagues and any time he walks into the game and you end up beating him is a pretty special night
9354671 todd said get your stuff and get to oakland as fast as you can
9354672 i dont think he made a single mental mistake tonight hes a no nonsense guy and he really prides himself on knowing what he is doing and executing
9354673 its great to see him get involved and take a big piece of the offense on his shoulders
9354674 when it came down to time to make plays i made some and got lucky on some
9354675 we did our job we got first downs and went down and scored when we had to
9354676 any time youre playing a big ten team and you feel good about stopping the run it gives you great confidence
9354677 did a nice job of running the clock and running the huddle he did a really nice job
9354678 i dont think its really respectful for our own fans to boo a player
9354679 especially when they dont even know what happened in the play that went wrong
9354680 i have a better grasp of the offense i know exactly what were trying to do against every look and the line did such a good job that i didnt have to run around

9354682 its great to see him get involved and take a big piece of the offense on his shoulders
9354683 when it came down to time to make plays i made some and got lucky on some
9354684 we did our job we got first downs and went down and scored when we had to
9354685 any time youre playing a big ten team and you feel good about stopping the run it gives you great confidence
9354686 this is still a big ugly storm still strong and i encourage everyone to leave
9354687 i cant take a chance because so many people died in katrina
9354688 i was here for katrina and i was going to stay but this ones coming really bad and i decided to get out
9354689 the wind looks to be stronger this time im scared it will rip the roof off
9354690 it remains likely that gustav will prove to become a worse case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9354691 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here

9354696 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9354697 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9354698 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9354699 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection
9354700 i dont think were going to go back to 1900 where everybody has to be white and male to run for national office
9354701 the fact that there are all these entry points to a candidate isnt really a solution to the question can i relate enough to that candidate
9354702 what i think youre going to see in this election is a much more accurate reflection of the voting population those who actually go out and vote than perhaps any other time in america
9354703 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that
9354704 i have to disseminate senator mccains message not only to all of the 15 000 members of the press but all those sitting at home and watching on tv
9354705 because we appreciate the liberties we have here and believe in getting involved
9354706 i knew the hours would be crazy but its ramped up sooner than i thought
9354707 there wont be any time to plan once the convention starts so we have to get all our work done now
9354708 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9354709 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9354710 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9354711 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9354712 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9354713 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9354714 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9354715 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9354716 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9354717 but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities this could be a a much worse storm hopefully it wont be but the possibilities are definitely there
9354718 is a no nonsense straight talker so we start by piling on the basics with an extra helping of cheese perhaps but not necessarily of the aged variety but the mccain pizza is also a maverick which is willing to function in a bi partisan manner so theres room here both for meat pepperoni and sausage and veggies green pepper and mushroom finally we add a helping of onions that some will insist is not truly conservative but which will undoubtedly deliver a surge of flavor and drive out the menacing forces of blandness
9354719 his legacy would be a chicago deep dish pizza the obama pizza also has a hint of audacity to it so we suggest a liberal layering of pepperoni to add bite and round out the ticket delivering a taste you can sink your teeth into however if youre not a fan of pepperoni dont be afraid to change your topping after all the obama pizza is all about change
9354720 the parties are both working hard to reach out beyond their stables to offer more descriptive representation on the ticket than weve seen in a long time
9354721 who are the best possible candidates but dont really connect with the average american and this year it seems like theyre going for people who for whatever reason could make that kind of connection

9354725 one way or another were either going to have a president who grew up in hawaii or a vice president who grew up in alaska in the white house how much broader can you get than that
9354726 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9354727 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9354728 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9354729 i played football basketball baseball soccer golf until i was a freshman in high school
9354730 ive lived more of a normal life ive had more fun doing it that way and being a regular kid a lot of people might need to go to a tennis academy and play for six hours a day my parents never saw it that way i could walk away from tennis at any time and theyd be fine with it

9354739 dani played really well but it was also great team effort overall
9354740 everyone got to play we played a really up tempo game and i think it set a great tone for the season
9354741 he isnt going to be swayed by what he likes on a visit he is going to make the broken leg decision where would he want to go to school if he wasnt playing basketball
9354742 i am thrilled with the schools he is considering they all offer great academics and great athletics
9354743 im not sure the coaches are used to moms asking that
9354744 he is hearing the most from duke rutgers and appalachian state right now
9354745 duke seems to be the most interested and wednesday hakeem had duke stuff on his car it is up to the colleges now
9354746 louisburg may have the best pair of running backs in the area
9354747 strickland could start for just about any team in the area
9354748 he went to the florida state camp and was named the mvp of the whole camp
9354749 i think he can help some college team and i think the college coaches know that hes going to get some offers
9354750 loyalty to petrified opinion never broke a chain or freed a human soul

9354753 i want you to grab life by its little bunny ears and get in its face
9354754 there are bad laws and cruel laws and the people who enforce them are both bad and cruel
9354755 with the first link the chain is forged the first speech censored the first thought forbidden the first freedom denied chains us all irrevocably
9354756 but the limit of tolerance for these human foibles is obtained when the proponent of a questionable scientific doctrine endeavors to maintain it against all possible odds by misrepresentation misinformation and suppression of contradictory data and by insinuating unfairness in opponents of his views
9354757 man stands alone in the universe a unique product of a long unconcious impersonal material process with unique understanding and potentialities these he owes to no one but himself and it is to himself that he is responsible he is not the creature of uncontrollable and undeterminable forces but his own master he can and must decide and manage his own destiny
9354758 this crap study proves the other crap studies wrong so i win
9354759 old labour was hostile to the market new labour has arguably been too deferential to it the modern progressive position has the confidence to assert the social over the economic it argues that there is more to decision making than competition law that the market needs to be shaped around the needs of society not vice versa this need to govern the market in the interests of society is something weve always done as a party from equalities legislation in the 1970s to the minimum wage 10 years ago and its an idea we need to be acting on and articulating more strongly over the next decade
9354760 o problema que o clube n o conseguiu contratar ningu m
9354761 this is what it means to be a friend for me
9354762 our preparation does not change our mentality in the finals does not change because we know what we have to do to get the result we want
9354763 we expected to play on saturday just now it is collingwood at home rather than geelong in melbourne
9354764 all that changes is that every game we now play is in elimination mode thats okay we would have liked to have finished fourth because of the double chance prize that position offers
9354765 we gave ourselves a chance and in the end we were not good enough now we play finals with an elimination mindset which happens after the first week fo the finals anyway its no problem
9354766 were happy to start the finals at home rather than in melbourne
9354767 i say well done st kilda and i take my hat off to them
9354768 for the st kilda team to keep their minds on the job to win an afl game any afl game by that margin is exceptional they deserve to finish fourth
9354769 whoever we are playing well go into the final with a positive attitude knowing our best is certainly good enough
9354770 whoever we come up against now we will be the underdogs because we werent tipped to make the finals in the first place it doesnt matter who we are playing if we are favourites or not we certainly have high expectations of our ourselves to put forward a good performance
9354771 do we go with kurt tippett ivan maric and moran or is it a combination of those three guys
9354772 we will think that one through our structure will not change that much
9354773 we continually see any player who has been out of this competition for a period of time their first week back is always pretty scratchy
9354774 this blog is protected by daves spam karma 2 68 spams eaten and counting
9354775 we got our style of play back our effort on the ball was where it was supposed to be
9354776 the second and third efforts were good that was at the heart of our performance it was a good strong four quarter performance
9354777 that is the important thing we played our style and it worked for us that brings confidence to the group
9354778 the game had to be ground out they did and they broke us up
9354779 we had too many passengers and our defence was under enormous stress
9354780 i felt we were getting better at it hardness at the ball to be beaten at it like this was embarrassing those who did not go hard enough will pay the price
9354781 theres so many stoppages at this level to get your hand on it more than the opposition is a huge advantage and that certainly happened
9354782 hes so important for us and his mobility and aerial strength were very hard to cover his real strength is his running ability when he runs so hard hes hard to match up on
9354783 as i said to the players after the game weve embarrassed ourselves our guernsey our club and our supporters
9354784 from the opening bounce they wanted it that bit more and being such a quality side they touched us up in every facet of the game
9354785 thats not the way we wanted to finish off but what is done is done and we move forward
9354786 in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9354787 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9354788 more rapidly build relationships with other producers of oil and gas
9354789 the dispatch of additional osce observers to the security zone and setting up an impartial monitoring of the acts of the georgian government
9354790 if i were to say that we dont care that we were indifferent i would be lying
9354791 of course will leave these positions where we are now we will not remain there forever
9354792 there is no point in isolating russia but we expect certain sanctions which wont be against the people but against the political elite
9354793 che permetter ad ogni ospite pagante di ottenere un biglietto omaggio per tornare al parco nel mese di ottobre e scoprire cos il parco in versione halloween
9354794 it was very clear from the beginning that we did not want to make some kind of cause documentary thats a genre like everything is going to be okay and here are the heroes
9354795 they msf doctors dont view themselves like that they are humans they are doing quite extraordinary stuff in crazy situations but it would be disingenuous to the actual reality of the situation to turn it into one of those standard cliches
9354796 this is low grade medicine the things that we do are not as good as they could be
9354797 i was completely burnt out dreaming about burned bodies and dying people i had trouble in my personal life maintaining my relationships i was becoming aggressive
9354798 what has happened in singur is unfortunate for west bengal for india and for all progressive indians
9354799 this event will unleash fear and uncertainty in the minds of all investors indian and foreign and is likely to be a stumbling block in the excellent gdp growth india has demonstrated in the last decade
9354800 marc is as we say in the film business an actors director
9354801 all the actors on the set really got on with him as far as olga and marc are concerned its their private lives and i dont want to comment on their personal relationship they are however both single people
9354802 rhys and some friends were down in the reception being quite boisterous they had obviously been sinking quiet a few drinks
9354803 he was particularly excited when the postman arrived he went outside and was singing hey mr postman and special delivery and giggling to himself manically
9354804 i dont know what was in there but it made a couple of people laugh and then rhys crouched down and slipped the pants between a couple of sacks of mail all the time laughing away to himself
9354805 when the postie arrived back he looked inside his sack and pulled out a piece of underwear he looked as if he was getting ready to gag
9354806 we did have an unofficial compliant from royal mail about a
9354807 yes oil has come down a fair way from its recent highs
9354808 but its going to have to come down a lot more and i mean a lot to have a significant impact
9354809 looking at the big picture oil is still up significantly from where it was a year ago or two years ago the longer term view is that this is a zero sum game
9354810 lower fuel prices are going to help a bit in the third quarter
9354811 the question is what happens to the american consumer and what that means for peak holiday shipping season
9354812 migration from air freight to ground freight may slow but it will not stop with oil this high
9354813 the railroads should see their market share continue to grow
9354814 falling oil prices while good for earnings could slow the rate of supply contraction and disappoint investors hoping for a supply led rally in the stocks
9354815 the overall flood situation in the country is alarming and very likely to deteriorate by the next two to three days
9354816 we now want a third alternative it will be led by the left front and follow an independent foreign policy communal harmony and pro people policies
9354817 the indo u s nuclear deal was never a part of the cmp it is not a stand alone deal it is part of americas design to gain control over india politically economically and militarily
9354818 people were wondering why we supported the upa even after all this
9354819 a person with no political or industrial affiliation be invited to act as an unbiased intermediator in the matter he or she can go into the demand articulated by you and give carefully thought out findings for the earnest consideration of all sides
9354820 if this thought was acceptable to you please suggest a name or names i would request the state government to respond positively
9354821 if my suggestion is acted upon i could urge that the status quo on the sites belonging to the owners unwilling to part with them be maintained even as you give pause to the agitation until the intermediators recommendation becomes available and hopefully leads to a solution
9354822 theyve done the right thing by sending him home theres got to be consistency in the group and youve got to stand for something you cant have players doing that sort of stuff
9354823 hes got to have a good look at what hes doing for sure hes got to re assess where hes at if hes doing these things its not the first time
9354824 those bangladeshis who are already staying in india should be provided citizenship further infiltration should be checked there should be strict vigil on the border
9354825 the party feels that in view of their social and economic conditions the scheduled caste and scheduled tribe people should get reservation in private sector every community or group should have equal representation in all sectors
9354826 the incidents had tarnished the secular image of the country
9354827 i spoke to union home minister shivraj patil seeking ten more companies of forces they should be arriving from guwahati by tomorrow
9354828 i saw damaged houses damaged buildings during visit to some village in kandhamal district
9354829 entrepreneurs and intellectuals from both india and china have shown their strong concern for establishing lasting peace and ending poverty in nepal
9354830 it is a good opportunity for nepal which has abundant natural resources
9354831 the first model is that of punjab haryana and uttar pradesh where the procurement agencies are well set and the procurement of grains is a regular activity
9354832 the second model is the bureaucratic circuitous route of procurement existing in maharashtra andhra pradesh karnataka gujarat and west bengal
9354833 the people of the state now feel that they should not have such a rule and therefore karunanidhi should seek a fresh mandate after dissolving the current assembly
9354834 it is a result of mismanagement and lack of proper governance
9354835 the government should not make excuses like shortage of water in reservoirs or raw material for power production
9354836 at least 50 trained personnel from fire brigade departments of surat and ahmedabad left on sunday with rescue equipment
9354837 we do not get authentic information from investigating agencies on time whatever action we have taken so far against militant outfits like huji and let along the border were based on media reports
9354838 without specific information it is very difficult to act it is a failure on the part of the probe agencies
9354839 what has happened in singur is unfortunate for west bengal for india and for all progressive indians
9354840 this event will unleash fear and uncertainty in the minds of all investors indian and foreign and is likely to be a stumbling block in the excellent gdp growth india has demonstrated in the last decade
9354841 earlier today the revised us indian draft waiver was transmitted to nsg states it makes no substantive concessions or changes and is essentially the same as the earlier draft proposal
9354842 he is presently enjoying a well deserved rest and also completing his travel formalities to go to australia by october
9354843 securing a batsman of younis calibre will provide our young south australian batsmen with unprecedented experience
9354844 the great deluge not only affected their livelihood and communities but also their traditional songs and culture rather then focusing on the destruction we have concentrated on the resilience and survival instinct of man
9354845 commercial music takes a lions share of the music industry but there is still a market for our music
9354846 there is no need to change the capital structure in ongc videsh despite its large takeover bid for imperial the entire funding will be provided as loan to them
9354847 we have already provided financial support to ongc videsh to the tune of rs 12 000 13 000 crore in the past as loan
9354848 we are a cash rich company and funding is not a problem ongc has reserves of about usd 4 3 billion and out which cash of usd 2 billion
9354849 we will go for usd 1 billion bridge funding and rest usd 1 8 billion would be from internal resources
9354850 it is still possible to resolve the issue through negotiation but the discussions should be within legal parameters and based on ground realities they should not raise demands which are not realistic and legally impossible
9354851 the fact is they cannot set up stages on the expressway and have people assemble there it is unlawful
9354852 not at the moment if required later we will take appropriate action
9354853 having an unblemished record and the fact that there has been no action in my service for so many years
9354854 i am feeling sad that people who work are being targeted like me i was never given any punishment in last 25 years but suddenly i have been served a dismissal order
9354855 our state committee is meeting on september 3 they will discuss the issue and decide
9354856 had the bihar government given a correct report about the condition of the barrage this situation would not have come up the state government reports till august 18 said the barrage was safe
9354857 for the last 15 years the barrage was not repaired
9354858 the centre provided more than what was demanded by the bihar government for rescue and relief operations but the state government has failed to carry out the rescue work
9354859 we have suspended the agitation for the time being and not called it off as some of our demands are yet to be met
9354860 the exclusive use of the land has been given to the shrine board without charging any money this has been agreed upon
9354861 and now the decision has been reached i feel happy
9354862 the decision has been taken unilaterally by the central government which has not taken care of the sensitivity of the majority community
9354863 fighting a long hard battle for amarnath and winning it with glory
9354864 although the land issue has no importance for us at the moment we reject the agreement
9354865 it is a historic day and victory day for us this day would be celebrated as vijay divas from now onwards in jammu region every year
9354866 raising of temporary pre fabricated accommodation establishment of tented accommodation by private camping agencies and setting up of the shops by shopkeepers locals permanent residents of the state and facilities for ponywallahs and pithuwallahs
9354867 i dont think we could be criticised for lacking fighting spirit even when we were losing we were fighting i think the indians tend to probably give up a bit too easily
9354868 we want to develop in our team that we dont give up to the last minute you can go through tough situations and tend to give in quite easily we have to keep having belief in your ability
9354869 losing the series was very disappointing but the huge crowd had supported us throughout the series and they turned up for the last match as well so we had to give them something back to show the character of the team
9354870 cancer treatment tough its horrific its the sort of treatment that reduces strong men to tears and it did me many a time
9354871 i was so full of morphine i kept falling asleep and then when i woke the relentless pain was still there but in the end there are just two of you in that match you and the bloody cancer
9354872 i would count my treatments like i once counted my runs i had to have 35 laser sessions just get to 18 id will myself then youll be on the home run you have to be mentally strong to keep the crying and the depression at bay
9354873 and all the time through all this pain and fog there is this niggling question at the back of your mind will it work
9354874 this is not a hindu versus muslim issue this is not jammu versus valley issue it is a surrender to the pressure of the separatists
9354875 and if now the decision has been reached i feel happy
9354876 we informed him governor of our stand and listened to his views we will inform trinamool congress chief of our talks with the governor and she will say whatever has to be said
9354877 the army is assisting the administration but the level of its involvement is not sufficient the state government is dong its best but the calamity is very high and needs more resources to rescue the affected people
9354878 while the people in bihar are thankful for the rs 1 000 crore package announced by manmohan singh more resources are required to rescue people to safer places from the flood hit areas
9354879 since the areas flooded had seen little or no floods there were shortage of boats to help ferry people we have requested the centre and other states to provide us with motorboats for rescue operations
9354880 we are worried last time we spoke to my brother was on august 21 when the ship was hijacked he said the ship is hijacked but he is safe
9354881 the central government should immediately intervene in the matter and try to free the hostages
9354882 he is the sole bread winner of our family and my mother has been continously crying since the time we were informed about hijacking
9354883 an outstanding cpc member a long tested and loyal communist fighter and a proletarian revolutionary who once held important leading posts in the cpc and the government
9354884 growth in agriculture along with enhanced production alone cannot meet our requirement we need to give stress on development of industry to create maximum possible employment opportunities benefitting even members of the educated farmers families as well
9354885 even educated members in farmers families are not interested in agriculture these days they want jobs
9354886 the decision has been taken unilaterally by the central government which has not taken care of the sensitivity of the majority community
9354887 any decision on this matter should have been taken only through consensus
9354888 jammu appeasement policy will further increase the alienation of kashmiris
9354889 im never impressed but my husband loves the place i asked him why once he said because he was full
9354890 it was the best of times it was the worst of times
9354891 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9354892 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9354893 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9354894 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9354895 we welcome americas new relationship with india including the us india civil nuclear accord our common security concerns and shared commitment to political freedom and representative government can be the foundation for an enduring partnership
9354896 it is a deep rooted problem who will invest in which state is a matter between the state government and the investor since it is a matter concerning the state it is not possible for the centre to take any initiative on this issue
9354897 we want industrialisation at the same time we have to protect the interests of the farmers we have to raise food production we have to strike a balance
9354898 dubai film market resulted from the absence of an international content market in the region it is designed to establish dubai as the regional centre for trade of content to benefit the rapidly evolving film media and technology industry at large
9354899 it will provide people involved in the tv home video and film industries with a networking platform to discover future trends and trade content on a global level
9354900 all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed
9354901 if the cops just let the party go on then they wouldnt have had to shut down parramatta rd or deal with a potentially volatile situation i feel it was a massive overreaction
9354902 i want people to know that greg and i are still very much together
9354903 i can definitely say i have not been approached by gregs team or his management
9354904 i will be supporting him in his plea all i can say is i wasnt very happy with the way police handled the situation
9354905 se entiende que un proyecto de la envergadura del que nos ocupa requiere de un an lisis m s profundo en cuanto a sus repercusiones sobre aquellos aspectos ambientales de mayor peso espec fico
9354906 esta incidencia debe ser resuelta antes del inicio de los trabajos
9354907 se requiere por tanto la modificaci n de la traza
9354908 la ocupaci n de este espacio implicar la p rdida de la vegetaci n existente y el deterioro temporal de la calidad del arroyo
9354909 el tratamiento realizado sobre este aspecto es muy superficial no se modeliza el comportamiento de un hipot tico derrame en consecuencia no se programan medidas de minimizaci n del riesgo espec ficos esta carencia no es asumible para un proyecto de esta envergadura
9354910 russian president dmitri medvedev last week said that he does not want a second cold war but is prepared for one if necessary clearly before waging its campaign to annex south ossetia from georgia the kremlin audited its relations with the west and concluded it has little to lose if they deteriorate that calculation is based on the view that russia was cheated in the post communist settlement moscow surrendered its military and economic empire in europe but whenever it subsequently raised objections to us policy there over nato enlargement independence for kosovo the establishment of a missile defence shield it was sternly rebuffed so it is better in the kremlins analysis to be feared as a rival power than sidelined as a subordinate one that calculation says as much about the relative weakness of the west as it does about new russian strength nato bogged down in afghanistan lacks a clear strategic purpose the washington doctrine of using force to spread democracy has been tested to destruction in iraq the credit crunch and high oil prices have drained the us and western europe of cash that gives an advantage to countries with hoards of capital to invest such as china or with energy to export such as russia for the first time since the collapse of communism the financial muscle of authoritarian states has as much bearing on the direction of the world economy as the wealth of liberal democracies that is a shift in global balance of power it is also a rebuttal of the post cold war idea that the world was converging towards western style capitalism it was assumed that economic prosperity and political freedom were indivisible as societies become richer the theory went a middle class would emerge to demand representation from its rulers that view failed to account for the return of nationalism as a rival ideology to democracy in both russia and china authoritarian regimes have persuaded their new wealthy elites to trade freedom for economic stability and global prestige this is a new social contract the state allows you to get rich as long as you do not use the money for political ends for the last decade the west has seen militant islam as the main ideological opponent to liberal capitalism before the south ossetian war when diplomats discussed a new cold war it was as likely to envisage iran as russia on the opposing side that preoccupation has resulted in a failure to understand the challenge of nationalist capitalism america and britain talk about human rights and democracy as if their benefits are self evident and universal but when it suits their strategic aims in latin america central asia or the middle east they collaborate with brutal dictatorships so it is hard in many parts of the world to distinguish between the promotion of western values and the crude enforcement of western interests that confusion dogs the argument over nato expansion membership is open in theory to countries that meet stringent criteria of political reform but when david miliband made a solidarity visit to ukraine in the wake of the georgia russia war his emphasis was not on the measures kiev can take to make itself an attractive partner for alliance instead he berated russia for failing to accept the reality of the post soviet world unfortunately the kremlin has demonstrated it has the power to change that reality unilaterally by force it also claims to be following the example of western interventions in kosovo and iraq when doing so american and european interests will not be served by military grandstanding and asserting the moral superiority of their political systems the west has never successfully exported its values by force but it has made them an attractive commodity for countries to import after the cold war communist societies were persuaded to change not by western rhetoric but by the economic reality that they could not compete with capitalism but china and russia have since concluded that authoritarian nationalism can compete with political liberalism that might suit the interests of regimes in beijing and moscow but it would ultimately be a tragedy for the people they rule far better they be persuaded that political pluralism individual liberties and human rights are values to be embraced not because the west says they are but because their rigorous application in western societies yields manifest global success westernisation must be an aspiration not a threat this new cold war will be won not by preaching democracy but by practising it
9354911 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9354912 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9354913 con franco siempre era posible entenderse a pesar de tod o era un hombre muy inteligente

9354916 dani played really well but it was also great team effort overall
9354917 everyone got to play we played a really up tempo game and i think it set a great tone for the season
9354918 dani played really well but it was also great team effort overall
9354919 everyone got to play we played a really up tempo game and i think it set a great tone for the season
9354920 dani played really well but it was also great team effort overall
9354921 everyone got to play we played a really up tempo game and i think it set a great tone for the season
9354922 with no help from the government to find a cure the folly pogs a dedicated group of volunteers with pain 24 7 chronic fatigue suffering sleepless nights and poor concentration have taken it upon themselves to move a few mountains
9354923 the ball which has been hit by the credit crunch has taken months to prepare and we need a full house to make it a really memorable night
9354924 frankly my members will do almost anything to find a cure they want to play with their children go cycling and dancing do their own housework instead of relying on others we are not lazy we just do not have the strength to do these things
9354925 the public can help us find a cure by supporting the ball all these super mums perfectionists and workaholics suffering with this miserable invisible disability do desperately need a cure
9354926 tenemos alrededor del 50 de la riqueza mundial pero s lo un 6 3 de la poblaci n

9354928 we dont think we have the right kind of tools to help decision makers plan for the future
9354929 a full branch plant op eration of prime minister stephen harpers ottawa office
9354930 its just not appropriate to sit in a room and talk for eight years meanwhile oilsands development is approved on the landscape
9354931 and we could no longer legitimately support a process that was being used to deflect attention from the governments failure to protect the environment
9354932 the largest half year consumption decline in volume terms in the last 26 years

9354943 tom had a very precise vision of the company that didnt challenge women
9354944 i used to think it was a good thing to be different than the other designers but no its not
9354945 but i cant always help it when i was 17 the design director at nino cerruti who was my first mentor taught me that to be too much ahead is to be behind the most important thing is to be right on time
9354946 when i arrived at this company everyone was saying how lucky i was to work at ysl
9354947 and i said just what have you purchased at ysl recently everyone thought it was such a prestigious brand but did they want to have a ysl bag or a ysl shoe the answer was always no because they didnt know what a ysl bag or shoe would be
9354948 there are always noises out there but you get used to them and ignore them
9354949 but on this occasion i heard a girl in tears and i looked out of the street and theres a kid lying in the street conscious but bleeding he was dying in front of my window but dragged himself in front of his house
9354950 one of his friends came back with a kitchen knife to go after the boy who did it but his friends were trying to calm him down and stopped him
9354951 shaquille was a nice boy he used to help my girlfriend with carrying the shopping bags and stroke our cat we would exchange words he wasnt aggressive but he got with the wrong crowd
9354952 police are appealing for witnesses following the fatal stabbing of a 14 year old boy in hackney
9354953 police were called at approximately 11 46pm on august 30 to st thomass place to reports of a male assaulted the male a 14 year old boy was taken to an east london hospital suffering a single stab wound to the stomach he was pronounced dead at 8 12am on august 31

9354955 if my body ended up as brunch for some badger or dachshund i know id be pissed
9354956 i take the dyspepsia as a sign that my brain has decided i shouldnt eat mammals too big for me to bench press
9354957 i scour the bathroom for the only antinausea medicine we have my wifes special berry flavored tums for pms sufferers
9354958 but i respect her passion being pro life is who sarah is
9354959 when you found out your baby would be born with down syndrome did you consider killing it before or after the due date
9354960 im still leaning toward obama sarah has been really good for our state and itd be wonderful to see her in the white house but shes on the ticket with mccain and i cant vote for mccain
9354961 it remains likely that gustav will prove to be a worst case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage

9354965 use our collective bargaining power rather than seek separate energy deals with russia
9354966 without urgent action we risk sleepwalking into an energy dependance on less stable or reliable partners
9354967 there can be no return to business as usual until russia commits fully to georgias territorial integrity and withdraws to its previous positions
9354968 any country that has a potential separatist movement will view the events in georgia through its own unique prism
9354969 but the greatest cause for concern lies in the ukraine azerbaijan and moldova all states that border russia
9354970 by illegally recognizing the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force
9354971 we have our western friends and those in central asia who are not in agreement with russian actions but we also have a strong relationship with russia
9354972 the georgian conflict isnt likely to have a direct effect on the emergence of new separatist or secessionist movements but it has the potential to create a long term precedent
9354973 the friendships you make are one of the best parts
9354974 we work hard to get donations to make the club attractive to the public
9354975 wake boarding is kind of like snow boarding on water
9354976 its a really big sport in the southern states and is beginning to gain popularity here
9354977 its definitely harder to stay on the board while being pulled by a boat but its fun and more relaxing than wake boarding
9354978 he saved some money and asked if we could help out
9354979 we told him to find a place negotiate a lease and we went from there
9354980 people would come from out of state just to ride it
9354981 i was setting up the pro shop at the marina i was working at and all the merchandise fell off the walls i got screamed at and realized i would never work for anyone again
9354982 eddie obriens restaurant buffalo chicken fingers with loaded fries are probably the closest thing to nirvana ever
9354983 my sister shes always in d c and it stinks
9354984 continued high fuel prices weak freight demand and escalating operating costs as well as tight credit markets
9354985 regrettably it was more politics as usual from rep kuhl
9354986 on july 24 of this year randy kuhl voted against the use it or lose it consumer energy supply act of 2008 which would have released 10 percent of the strategic oil reserve for consumer use this would have lowered and stabilized gas prices within a matter of weeks
9354987 the use it or lose it policy is already the law of the land and speaker nancy pelosi and majority leader steny hoyer know it
9354988 the fact is that the congressman supports suspending shipments to the strategic petroleum reserve and sent a letter to the president urging him to suspend shipments of oil to the strategic petroleum reserve and allow more oil to remain on the market
9354989 your television ads keep saying things that are not true and you have refused to accept my proposals to have a debate
9354990 we have said publicly when we can arrange our schedule we will meet were not going to do it on your demands
9354991 one elephant was 86 years old and had no teeth so she got her watermelon peeled
9354992 tottenham played very well and they are a team that plays football
9354993 we had more chances but we made mistakes on the final shot and today we have not won but i am satisfied with my team
9354994 i learned that sometimes we need more chances in england if you have only two or three shots on goal you never win
9354995 its not disappointing both teams are strong and they marked in the middle and put five players in the middle
9354996 we are very sorry about this situation and share the disappointment of the festival goers

9355006 after years of gardening with our mucky black soil my hands felt like leather i started using your shielding lotion and after about a week i noticed my hands were looking very different they were looking so good i started having manicures for the first time in my life i actually started wearing polish and was not ashamed of my hands

9355008 ive got nothing but good things to say about it it worked its way into my dreams the night after my first taste of it as with any good thing i wish there was more of it why i cant just forget about dd and work as a bouncer in sols for the rest of my life but that would remain true no matter how much there was to do
9355009 overall the world of tnm seems very consistent to me which is for a game of this size and such a long development time a major achievement indeed finishing a mod of this epic proportions is simply legendary no matter if it sucks or not tnm doesnt suck it shines as the best mod i have ever had the honour to play
9355010 its funny huge good fun well written little bit too much walking around but probably the best mod on dx by a long way
9355011 personally i feel that tnm on its own rivals the game it modifies

9355054 in four month old babies we demonstrate very early specialisation and indeed an adult like pattern of activation of the brain regions that process face to face social interaction
9355055 we are not claiming it could diagnose autism merely that it may prove a useful early warning signal
9355056 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9355057 with the help of god i will hold the balance level
9355058 profoundly regretted the behaviour of chelseas directors who despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player have continued to make statements and gestures
9355059 all this has done is to cloud the situation and confuse public opinion
9355060 ive already told the president and coach management and the media my head is at chelsea i want to play over there
9355061 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9355062 just before an important official match real madrid feels that all of its attention should be focused on the game a criteria that has been completely ignored by its player robinho with the statements he made just hours before the match
9355063 the problem is that real did not manage to recruit schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything
9355064 there is nothing wrong with publicly confirming our interest in a player when the club involved is well aware of it has been in receipt of two bids and is negotiating to sell the player so we completely refute any criticism from real madrid
9355065 as for the issue regarding the website real are well aware this was a regrettable accident by an external supplier which was rectified as soon as it was brought to our attention and not a single shirt was sold
9355066 ratings below these levels are unacceptable and are being addressed through service improvements
9355067 they are taking my place over next week i expect you will be
9355068 you see killbots have a preset kill limit knowing their weakness i sent wave after wave of my own men at them until they reached their limit and shutdown kif show them the medal i won
9355069 thats not his arse is it he must have aids in his arse it looks very well used
9355070 any interference of this kind carries real danger and a sanction is required
9355071 hes young and a winner with an olympic gold medal to prove that but more so he will provide us with great balance in the side
9355072 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us
9355073 i am very happy to come here and play in the premier league playing in england has been a lifelong dream which has finally come true by moving to city
9355074 id met him mark hughes previously and was really impressed with him but having talked to him about manchester city i had to come here and be part of his plans
9355075 im very confident of helping the first team to achieve their goals for the season and after walking around the stadium i cant wait to play in front of the city fans there it is very impressive
9355076 ku mengharapkan ramadhan kali ini penuh makna agar dapat ku lalui dengan sempurna

9355078 i am more than happy with my progress and i hope to be back playing for united by the end of september that is my target and it is a realistic one
9355079 it has been frustrating to miss the start of the premier league season but i am pleased with my rehabilitation and hopefully ill be ready soon
9355080 good show you rock and may take that in point form if you wish
9355081 hes got to be able to knock people out or fight by throwing punches in bunches
9355082 thats the key we cant have fights at madison square garden where the public are coming to see heavyweight title fights and there is no action
9355083 we need to see that the public like to see sensationalism in fights if not knockouts then he needs to stand and fight throwing punches america is ready and waiting for nikolai
9355084 the most marketable heavyweight out there simply because of his freakish size
9355085 there is no one in the heavyweight division who can beat niko if he continues to improve
9355086 we want a match with wladimir klitschko this would be a huge fight in germany
9355087 what part of role playing exactly leads people into these hornets nests of insanity

9355090 the most merciful thing in the world i think is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents we live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity and it was not meant that we should voyage far the sciences each straining in its own direction have hitherto harmed us little but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality and of our frightful position therein that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age

9355095 se dicessimo di ritenerci soddisfati di questa attuale situazione saremo fuori dalla realta
9355096 the situation has not changed i want to leave real and play for chelsea i am only thinking of chelsea and want to play there
9355097 since may i have been trying to renew my contract but they didnt want to know because they were so sure of signing cristiano ronaldo
9355098 now they havent signed anyone they dont want me to go
9355099 ramon calder n had said that if a good offer came they would let me go chelsea have made a great effort and i dont know what more i can do
9355100 if schuster wants to keep a player who is unhappy it is his responsibility
9355101 i have told the president the sports director predrag mijatovic and the coach schuster i want to go but i wont refuse to play for real if i stay
9355102 newcastle united can confirm that captain michael owen has been offered an extended and improved three year contract
9355103 the proposed terms of the new deal include an increased salary for michael and demonstrate the clubs commitment to keeping him
9355104 the club hopes that this enhanced contract offer will keep him at st james park
9355105 im afraid a club and a manager not wanting a player to go sometimes is not enough
9355106 but thats not to say in any way shape or form that we want to see michael owen leave this club

9355206 due to the economy we are going to have to let one of you go
9355207 pray we use our god given brains and heed the warnings
9355208 we are taking the necessary steps to ensure the safety of louisiana s pets
9355209 it is imperative that pet owners with critical transportation needs ctn get to the parish pick up points as soon as possible
9355210 it will take time to register everyone and their pets and complete all the paperwork accurately
9355211 we have received numerous requests for assistance from local parish shelters and other animal welfare organizations in louisiana
9355212 we are working closely with the louisiana state animal response team to assist and provide resources
9355213 if nobody wants to talk with us on these issues and cooperation with russia is not needed then for gods sake do it yourself
9355214 moscow has decided to finally finish building irans nuclear reactor in the southern town of bushehr before the end of the year after holding back for five years at washingtons insistence
9355215 israel will not allow iran to attain nuclear capability and if time begins to run out jerusalem will not hesitate to take whatever means necessary to prevent iran from achieving its nuclear goals
9355216 just because you agree with the academy that we made the best film of 2007
9355217 dont think youre any closer to figuring out our motives were still tough to get deceit is our job our pleasure and your challenge
9355218 a gut that swings back and forth in front of me like a shopping cart with a bent wheel
9355219 the companys first vertical exploration well of 2008 n 14 a has been drilled to a depth of 8 500 feet 2 600 meters the well encountered horton bluff shale at a depth of 3 600 feet 1 100 meters and drilled through a total of 4 900 feet 1 500 meters of shale and interbedded sands before drilling was terminated in the lower horton bluff an extensive suite of open hole logs has been obtained over the entire shale interval core was taken in the shale over a 60 foot 18 meter interval at a depth of 5 800 feet 1 700 meters and cuttings samples were retrieved throughout the drilling operation log and lab analyses are currently underway in calgary and houston the highest gas response was observed while drilling the interval between 4 200 and 8 200 feet 1 300 to 2 500 meters preliminary analysis of the shales below 8 200 feet 2 500 meters indicate higher thermal maturity and diminished gas response so the decision was made to suspend drilling at 8 500 feet 2 600 meters and to set 7 inch intermediate casing by setting the large intermediate casing the company retains the option to either deepen or drill out horizontally depending on formation evaluation and completion results in the vertical well triangle owns a minimum 45 working interest in the well and is the operator the companys second vertical exploration well in 2008 o 61 c spudded early this week this well is located approximately 14 miles 22 kilometers west of n 14 a and is located in a separate fault block from n 14 a extending the trend from the two kennetcook test wells drilled by triangle in 2007 planned total depth is 9 900 feet 3 000 meters this well has been positioned using seismic to test the horton bluff shales and to evaluate potential conventional reservoirs in the uphole windsor group triangle owns a minimum 45 working interest in this well also and is the operator
9355220 we are pleased with the on track progress of the windsor shale drilling operations and encouraged by the results obtained contacts current level of shale exploration activity in nova scotia and new brunswick is an exciting compliment to the companys ongoing oil production and field optimization in onshore atlantic canada
9355221 ive been listening to the democrats give speeches ive been listening to them talk about striving and dreaming and working hard to achieve goals and overcome challenges
9355222 and it seems to me that we as a family dont spend enough time in the evenings sitting around a kitchen table as far as i can tell its all about the kitchen table
9355223 if you two are going to have any kind of a future in political life ive realized that were going to have to devote a certain amount of time to sitting around the kitchen table wondering how were going to pay the bills
9355224 but first off that doesnt mean that they always get paid besides i dont see how that should affect our ability to stare at them
9355225 if ever you want to run for any public office its important that you have long whispered conversations into the night until i threaten to whup you or something
9355226 i think its something slightly less annoying than a facebook poke
9355227 and i know youre 13 but itd be good if you still sat on my lap
9355228 historically good now im going to make an historic dinner oh and if sometimes you as my youngest could spontaneously shout i love you daddy thatd be great
9355229 im going to strive to give you two opportunities that i never had and ive had a fair number of opportunities so that means
9355230 the rl has enough high tech gadgetry and premium luxury features to satisfy most customers not to mention an excellent repair history and attractive window sticker if youre a technology junkie the 2008 rl showcases the latest automotive high tech gadgetry in an attractive package that is both user friendly and semi intuitive drivers who prefer razor sharp handling to straight line performance will love the rls super handling all wheel drive sh awd inside the rl wood trim combines with perforated leather to create an interior befitting the cars sport luxury disposition
9355231 the rl package is a compelling one and given its sharp interior styling and genuinely handsome exterior we can think of little reason this acura shouldnt give the big guns some competition
9355232 the costs of raw materials and purchased components have been rising at unprecedented rates for the past few years and have continued throughout 2008 steel costs have more than doubled this year alone and aluminum is now projected to increase another 45 percent by year end while we have historically adjusted our pricing models as material costs have climbed over time we felt that with such significant adjustments we owe it to our customers to provide them as much advanced notice as possible as always we continue to aggressively seek ways to contain costs and provide the best value to our customers
9355233 its a crunch for us and were at the maximum that we can charge
9355234 were not going to buy romaine lettuce or leaf lettuce for a little while
9355235 were going to have to stick to plain old iceberg for a while
9355236 with the turkey ham you put it on a sandwich add more lettuce cheese and tomato to make it a little more edible
9355237 if you have a couple of children you maybe cant afford to have them buy the few times a week they used to
9355238 i have two kids and you double the cost every week now its 3 a day so no way
9355239 were serving things that require a little bit more labor theyre a little bit more costly
9355240 were looking at what type of bread were using and maybe replacing it with something less expensive
9355241 it was a rather small offering there were a few fruits but there wasnt any cheese on it
9355242 they say they would like lobster and shrimp on the menu but unfortunately we cant accommodate them
9355243 thats one thing i dont talk about because its all speculation
9355244 the main thing is im a blue jay thats my focus
9355245 at the end of the day there are 700 billion a year spent on administration
9355246 insurance companies as we know them need to be redefined
9355247 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9355248 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9355249 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9355250 that started when the travelers people bought us in 1998
9355251 i have shown you the way but you refuse to take head if you want to live by the flesh you will die by the flesh
9355252 i panicked when i realized theyd close after labor day so i started stockpiling extra quarts of it for over the winter
9355253 in some ways only being open at a certain time of the year may make the experience of coming here more special
9355254 most of our help are in high school or college so by the end of august theyre getting ready to head back
9355255 we really have no choice but to close because we just dont have the people to keep the store running
9355256 theres never been a set date that well close one year we closed right on labor day other years weve tried to stay open a few weeks beyond
9355257 as the town thins out it becomes a matter of diminishing returns you may have less people to sell to but the cost of keeping the place running is the same in september and october as it is in july
9355258 but im very big on quality and almost immediately after labor day it gets very quiet on this end of town you end up not having enough people to serve the customers you have
9355259 then at some point you dont have enough customers to make it worthwhile to stay open so we just close
9355260 we have one lady who religiously orders four dozen crumb cakes on labor day
9355261 she said she cant live without them and they freeze great she comes back year after year
9355262 summer isnt something you can put off its fleeting and there are certain aspects of it you have to enjoy while you can thats what i like about coming to the shore
9355263 the shore is an experience a moment a taste and its sad when its over you have to do whatever you can to get by without it until next summer
9355264 they are putting half of their egg 255 million into this tower
9355265 this is going to help the trump taj mahal regain its mojo
9355266 he managed the final renovations for caesars to do what its doing today
9355267 hes really good at handling the high end level high rollers
9355268 they love him that is a piece of the market we do very well with
9355269 your higher end gaming customer will stay in these rooms
9355270 if they are able to achieve that kind of cash flow that would represent a return on investment of between 14 and 16 percent
9355271 fifteen percent is really the bar you want to reach
9355272 i can assure you that the toll increase whatever he comes out with will not be even close to what he proposed before
9355273 if we as a society and as a state agree that we need to fund transportation and we agree that the only real way to do that is by raising the money then we have to decide whats the fairest way
9355274 were going to confront it and make it a priority
9355275 i just hope its not an election year or leading up to an election year gimmick but its true reform
9355276 my character is this lover and confidante of the duchess
9355277 but she also ends up being the lover and confidante of the duke and they live together as a menage a trois for 25 years and i found that concept fascinating
9355278 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9355279 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9355280 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9355281 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9355282 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9355283 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9355284 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9355285 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9355286 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9355287 but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities this could be a a much worse storm hopefully it wont be but the possibilities are definitely there
9355288 its a little naive on the part of the media to assume because they werent reporting this palins consideration for the last few months theres something up on this we didnt spend any time saying yes or no to any of the speculation just because everyone thought it was going to be mitt romney for a month and then it was going to be joe lieberman for a month
9355289 these guys are all good surrogates theyve done a thousand hours of surrogate work
9355290 i dont think we needed to audition anybody at the democratic national convention a week before ours its wonderful to fill cable time with it but its just nonsense
9355291 i was in the rules committee with about 150 people in the room they had tvs set up and we took a break to watch the announcement for a second after she came out it was silent then there was a gasp and everybody stood up and started cheering and clapping we stayed standing the whole speech
9355292 there were 10 or 12 women party stalwarts in tears using napkins and handkerchiefs
9355293 ignited a wave of elation and emotion that has led some grass roots activists to weep with joy
9355294 shes lived it its so satisfying as a conservative woman when she walked out on that stage there was just this moment it was really emotional for a lot of us
9355295 finally we can get 100 percent behind the republican ticket change we can believe in
9355296 you know ive had my problems with mccain but he has reached out a hand to us both at the nra annual meeting earlier this year and with the amazing selection of sarah palin as his running mate
9355297 i was happy the people were cheering and encouraging me but i would have liked to be cheered because i won not because i needed encouragement it is something i will work on i will try my best not to be the last person next time it was nice for people to give me that encouragement but i would prefer the winning cheer
9355298 absolutely yup yup especially with a good team around us
9355299 f hlen sie sich fit f r ein amt das nur ein herzschlag vom pr sidentensessel trennt
9355300 sarahs eltern sind trainer ihre familie l uft ich fr her auch und da kam mir track
9355301 alaska liegt doch dicht bei russland das vergisst man ja leicht
9355302 wieviel unendliche liebe auch immer dort ist am ort von rast und heil sie wird vervielfacht durch die wunderbare frau die wir ehren feiern und lieben leb wohl beh t dich gott meine treue freundin
9355303 wir alle m ssen mit den boxern leben die wir haben
9355304 i wanted to know where to get a waterproof digital camera
9355305 i didnt think in spring training that id be part of anything like that
9355306 i wanted to but i didnt think it was a possibility sometimes you get things that you dont expect so it was nice
9355307 i know that everybody feels especially happy for him he looks really comfortable out there and i like that
9355308 little bit of nervousness in my first game in my hometown
9355309 thirty people here to see me and i just let it overwhelm me
9355310 i think were making it a whole lot more difficult than we should
9355311 the project is an important initiative for the group to shift to overseas areas with abundant energy sources thus achieving strategic restructuring of the group
9355312 the u s subprime crisis global inflation depreciating u s dollar natural disasters including snowstorms and a serious earthquake had a negative impact on chinas economic development
9355313 the production operation and development of the company will face challenges mainly due to the great cost pressure driven by high prices of mineral resources coal electricity oil and other energy sources as well as transportation cost
9355314 the fierce competition in domestic mineral resources and nonferrous metals markets are bringing difficulties for production supply and sales
9355315 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9355316 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9355317 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9355318 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9355319 this study changes the certainty of the evidence we have about fish oils
9355320 inflation is not an additional source of concern above and beyond those other developments
9355321 it is a strange leap to observe that investors consistently make an error and then recommend that error to current investors based on precedent
9355322 he has improved a lot and he has that powerful serve
9355323 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9355324 i still cant believe it i was playing great and he was playing great too
9355325 when youre training and wondering why you do all the work and feeling sorry for yourself and what have you you kind of push through and keep working
9355326 then when you have moments like that on the court you feel like its all worth it
9355327 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9355328 its one of those situations where youre trying to do your best and you come in against a lot of good hitters
9355329 its nothing to disrespect the opponent its just the fact that you get into a situation that you want to do your best and on top of that i got one of my hometown friends geovany soto
9355330 i had a huge at bat there in the eighth inning and didnt come through
9355331 its part of the game sometimes you hit a big homer and you kind of stand there and look and enjoy the success at that moment i think it was a big strikeout for him
9355332 i had a good year get hurt then have a bad year then dont play one year then turn into a platoon kind of a bench player all of a sudden hopefully this sets me back in the right direction
9355333 we just squandered too many opportunities and left a lot of people on base
9355334 the home plate umpire said that he wasnt tagged the first base umpire said he was tagged in the hip
9355335 one of them was right and one of them was wrong
9355336 we lost control of the game in the second half the serie a season is a marathon so its all right that we drew this match im unhappy not because of the draw but because we didnt play well
9355337 parents who have students that attend that school say are you budgeted for custodial
9355338 over the centuries the doctors of the church have not been able to make that definition
9355339 human life must be protected absolutely from the moment of conception
9355340 als mir die fans den mittelfinger gezeigt haben wusste ich alles ist wieder wie es war
9355341 wir befinden uns bereits mit mehreren interessenten in verkaufsverhandlungen die beraus erfreulich verlaufen
9355342 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9355343 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9355344 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9355345 the hilton organized the bulletins 10th anniversary party in 1972 then our 15th then our 30th
9355346 i cant see how we could possibly not cover it its our job to tell people whats happening in brussels
9355347 a hotel doesnt need to explain why they choose one supplier over another that would be a local decision
9355348 its not our policy to get into a slanging match with other media were in the job of building relationships
9355349 they have perfect liberty to cancel the subscription any time they want for any reason they want
9355350 what upset me was the consortium of hotels coming together to support the hilton
9355351 our financial stability is at stake with such a major response were reeling from the impact
9355352 we took a story that had been reported and covered it factually we reported this story as wed do with any other story
9355353 its like youve got a wallet with 20 in it someone offers you 15 for the wallet and its contents and you say o k
9355354 theres no guarantee theyre going to spend it wisely or give it back to you
9355355 the biggest thing youll notice when you get married is that he will put the toilet paper on the roll the wrong way
9355356 guys do tend to put it on upside down whats up with that
9355357 will explore all possible countermeasures in cooperation with the south korean government to make the japanese government completely revoke the punitive tariffs at an early date
9355358 hyundai had the chance today to show us that it had paid for the licenses then we would have gone but that was not the case they could not prove they had paid so we took the devices away
9355359 they only select 11 features into the dances with films fest from a countless amount submitted
9355360 to even be in the festival was an honor and to win the grand jury is beyond words
9355361 we will rather focus on what is a great opportunity for us
9355362 every time they created they used the opportunities and every time we were turned over they punished us
9355363 this is what i expect from the team but were only about 60 70 percent of where we want to be
9355364 there has been plenty of criticism but it shows that the process is now beginning to work
9355365 certainly the choice of palin puts to rest any argument about inexperience on the democratic team and while palin is a fine person her lack of experience makes the thought of her assuming the presidency troubling
9355366 we need to respect tottenham they are a very good team and play very well and sometimes makes it impossible to win
9355367 we had more chances but we made mistakes with the final shots they put five six seven eight nine players in the back and its difficult to create
9355368 in the first half maybe we were paying a little bit too much respect to our opponents maybe even overawed by chelsea and the stadium
9355369 but by the second half that was a thing of the past our performance in the second half pretty much deserved the point
9355370 this is why we made more mistakes we need to try to work more with the ball
9355371 i really dont think the media attention ive missed out on is a problem
9355372 most people are only starting to pay attention to the race now and were getting good media coverage wherever i go
9355373 all we have to say is say were going to be energy independent in 10 years
9355374 all we need are leaders who have the courage to do it and people to follow them
9355375 this week he alluded to question of my character in six weeks of campaigning thus far hes yet to discuss any positions of substance in his desire for re election after 13 years in albany as the chief status quo senator people should certainly expect better
9355376 sheriff beilein publicly criticized grear for not joining that search something grear has never given a clear explanation for probably because there is no explanation
9355377 if grear really is a true public servant as he claims then he should have no problem opening up his personnel record to full public view
9355378 brian grear is asking republican voters to support him over sen maziarz yet we know very little about mr grear and what we do know doesnt appear to be very good
9355379 hes talking about his record and if hes going to talk about his record then he should be proud to release all of it
9355380 i signed the agreement and my attorney has always advised me not to say anything except that i did win
9355381 the bottom line is i was in the right all along and won the case
9355382 they deserve to know that wojtaszek and maziarz are bad people who have their own agendas and that maziarz has failed us during his senate tenure
9355383 oh you atheists are far too scared to go after islam the way you do after christianity
9355384 the habit of religion is oppressive an easy way out of thought
9355385 if you cant do the time dont do the crime
9355386 if you wont spend the dime dont whine about crime
9355387 despite what theyre saying about the economy and our industry it still looks pretty bright
9355388 nothing is recession proof but theres still a whole lot of optimism out there
9355389 its getting sort of harder to find the sectors that are growing
9355390 you dont see hospitals closing you dont see nursing homes closing you absolutely need more nurses its a wonderful profession to be in because you can go anywhere in the country and get a job
9355391 the economy has affected people spending money on home care
9355392 apl had a bigger problem than most because it is very dependent on the u s west coast
9355393 ron was the operations guy for apl at the time and had to deal directly with the issue and he helped apl come through it better than many other companies would have
9355394 governor schwarzenegger who was in san diego yesterday as the senate took up the budget has made it clear that he does not support our compromise budget and will not ask any republican to vote to pass it
9355395 is not fiscally responsible because it simply pushes our problems to next year
9355396 unfortunately weve been unable to get the type of cooperation that is essential to finding a solution without raising taxes
9355397 i had a lot of good people to choose from
9355398 i have found the right partner i found someone who has accomplished reform who has accomplished and managed a multibillion dollar budget and fought against corruption and the failed politics of the past
9355399 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy thing
9355400 its like that old adage a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reason
9355401 obviously shes a fine mother and an up and coming public servant
9355402 its too early for me to gauge what kind of running mate shell be my sense is that she subscribes to john mccains agenda
9355403 it wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9355404 people are buying these cars from me and turning around and selling them as if they were flipping real estate
9355405 we can create a model that others can look to
9355406 utah shows that the technology is here and the fuel works and the fuel is better than foreign oil
9355407 despite what theyre saying about the economy and our industry it still looks pretty bright
9355408 nothing is recession proof but theres still a whole lot of optimism out there
9355409 its getting sort of harder to find the sectors that are growing
9355410 you dont see hospitals closing you dont see nursing homes closing you absolutely need more nurses its a wonderful profession to be in because you can go anywhere in the country and get a job
9355411 the economy has affected people spending money on home care
9355412 we see a major shift in the sentiment toward concern about growth over inflation
9355413 inflation is peaking and in some countries like china and singapore it has already peaked
9355414 markets could start to position for lower yields in countries where the macro picture for bonds is improving and the central bank has been tightening for a while
9355415 at one extreme we have indonesia where policy credibility has clearly been earned and the prognosis for the rupiah remains sanguine and hence offshore participation in the bond market remains robust
9355416 bank negara is the only major central bank in asia not to have hiked rates this year effectively showing a unique indifference to the risks of second round effects emerging in the country
9355417 in not doing so bank negara risks being accused of lacking independence
9355418 i need some jeans to make them look good until i can get back to the gym i need them tight but not too tight they just need to look tight
9355419 why dont i meet you outside you probably dont want to see this
9355420 is boxing really that low it is sad and turns boxing to the negative side
9355421 ruiz knocked valuev down in the second round and it didnt count and that could have changed the out come
9355422 i dont know what happened with the japanese judge but we will take his words
9355423 we will sit back watch the tape and make some decisions
9355424 it seems like every time i come here for business i get the bad end of the situation
9355425 i did not do what i wanted to do 100 percent
9355426 they have a dual growth and inflation mandate but they tend to focus more on the growth side of things when the economy is weak
9355427 we want to bring visualization to a whole new audience
9355428 the interesting thing we noticed was that users kept trying to upload blog posts and entire books
9355429 its great that people can paste in a youtube video of cats
9355430 so why not a visual that gives you some insight into the sea of data that surrounds us i might find one thing someone else something completely different and thats where the conversation starts
9355431 many eyes is unusual because it takes advantage of the collective intelligence of a group to get more out of a data set
9355432 i wanted people to understand that you can take the same data and have it tell lots of different stories
9355433 the gift of the internet is that everyone can participate and the tools can be brought to a much wider audience
9355434 with visualization it might be possible to open your eyes and see something that will help you
9355435 yes fundamentals are bad but if investors dont have confidence to lend money to the real economy then the real economy wont be able to progress
9355436 volatility seems unusually low for the degree of uncertainty in the economic monetary policy and market outlook
9355437 the outlook for the economy is not as good as some of the figures might suggest
9355438 but nevertheless there is some perception in the markets that the u s economy is in a stabilizing mode
9355439 you would probably need to see quite a negative surprise in the jobs report minus 100 000 before the markets change the perception again
9355440 with two to go you dont get too many chances like that and i had a good opportunity
9355441 i thought i hit a good putt there but halfway there it just wiggled left that was the end of the dream
9355442 and then on the front nine my back nine a couple eagles really boosted the round for a while there there was certainly a chance of 59
9355443 stoner was going very fast but i had a good feeling with my bike then i saw him slipping
9355444 i thought well its an annoyance but its not really hampering our work
9355445 and it was clear they werent upset about something in general they were upset with me
9355446 there are violations that both nicole and madeleine are worried about
9355447 they are matters that i dont believe would rise to the level they would prosecute under the current standards of the u s attorneys office but in this circumstance perhaps theyll ignore their own standards to prosecute madeleine or her daughter to get what they want
9355448 fundamentally it is unfair that the government in efforts to get barry bonds would threaten nicole and her mother to try to get anderson to testify against bonds ive been an attorney for 32 years i was a prosecutor for 10 years but i have never heard anything like this
9355449 its definitely hardball and can be looked at as heavy handed but it is not unusual or inappropriate especially in drug cases
9355450 if anything this shows how serious the government is taking the investigation
9355451 we laugh and say you can watch dawn patrol at the balloon races and get a crick in your neck from looking up then come to virginia city and get the crick out of your neck while watching the camel races
9355452 it gives people a full day of something to do
9355453 the camel races have always happened in good times and bad times and even in years when we were down to just a few camels
9355454 were showing that the geologic record shows that in the past ice sheets have melted much faster than were predicting at the end of this century
9355455 it could easily be more than double what is suggested
9355456 the ice sheet was existing in a pretty warm climate and what we show is that that sunlight was enough to melt the ice sheet away very rapidly
9355457 the word glacial used to imply that something was very slow
9355458 this new evidence indicates that glacial is anything but slow
9355459 this finding shows the potential for ice to disappear quickly given the right push
9355460 they now predict a half metre sea level rise with most of that coming from the expansion of the ocean due to warming and very little of that coming from ice sheet meting
9355461 ice sheet melting could be a much bigger component so these values should be seen as low estimates
9355462 get out of town this is not the one to play with
9355463 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9355464 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9355465 certainly the age of the individual always heightens that anxiety and fear that people have about their safety
9355466 i can assure you that the toll increase whatever he comes out with will not be even close to what he proposed before
9355467 if we as a society and as a state agree that we need to fund transportation and we agree that the only real way to do that is by raising the money then we have to decide whats the fairest way
9355468 were going to confront it and make it a priority
9355469 i just hope its not an election year or leading up to an election year gimmick but its true reform
9355470 they dont want to go back to school and not be able to be on the beach
9355471 if it wasnt the needles whatever it would be the weather
9355472 i have to tell you this thing this may be my only chance
9355473 enjoy an uncritical acceptance which would never be accorded religious faith
9355474 to agree that there are objective values for which we should have serious regard because of their implications for the good of society
9355475 successive decisions in europe which have undermined the family based on marriage the right to life from the moment of conception to natural death the sacredness of the sabbath the right of christian institutions to maintain and promote their ethos including schools these and other decisions have made it more difficult for committed christians to maintain their instinctive commitment to the european project
9355476 an uncritical acceptance which would never be accorded religious faith
9355477 an end time army has one common purpose to aggressively take ground for the kingdom of god under the authority of jesus christ the dread champion
9355478 the trumpet is sounding calling on fire revolutionary believers to enlist in joels army many are now ready to be mobilized to establish and advance gods kingdom on earth
9355479 the pitch and intensity of the military rhetoric of this branch of the global dominionist movement has substantially increased since the beginning of 2008
9355480 one can only wonder how long before this transforms into real warfare with actual warriors
9355481 get busy in constructing a bible based social political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of god
9355482 such leaders prefer more authoritarian structures where their own word or decrees are unchallenged
9355483 everyone born after abortions legalization can consider their birth a personal invitation to take part in this great army
9355484 as the church begins to take on this resolve they joels army churches will start to be thought of more as military bases and they will begin to take on the characteristics of military bases for training equipping and deploying effective spiritual forces
9355485 in time the church will actually be organized more as a military force with an army navy air force etc
9355486 some pastors and leaders who continue to resist this tide of unity will be removed from their place some will become so hardened they will become opposers and resist god to the end
9355487 i am thinking god why is the power of god not moving and he said it is because you havent kicked that women in the face and there was like this older lady worshipping right in front of the platform and the holy spirit spoke to me and the gift of faith came on me he said kick her in the face with your biker boot i inched closer and i went like this makes kicking motion bam and just as my boot made contact with her nose she fell under the power of god
9355488 i believe were headed to an elijah jezebel showdown on the earth not just in america but all over the globe and the main warriors will be the prophets of baal versus the prophets of god and there will be no middle ground
9355489 theres an elijah generation thats going to be the forerunners for the coming of jesus a generation marked not by their niceness but by the intensity of their passion
9355490 the kingdom of heaven suffers violence and the violent take it by force such force demands an equal response and jesus is going to make war on everything that hinders love with his eyes blazing fire
9355491 a lot of people die for god and theyre not afraid
9355492 like dawn spreading across the mountains a large and mighty army comes such as never was of old nor ever will be in ages to come
9355493 it is a complete misinterpretation of scripture to find in joels army of locusts a militant victorious force attacking society and a non cooperating church to prepare the earth for christs millennial reign
9355494 through cain came all the smart educated people down to the antediluvian flood the intellectuals bible colleges
9355495 they know all their creeds but know nothing about god
9355496 a super race mentality toward the training of their children
9355497 today you can type joels army into a search engine and a thousand heresy hunter websites pop up decrying the very mention of it
9355498 this battle is not a game they joels army warriors will not be on the defense they will be on the offense and the gates of hell will not be able to hold up against them
9355499 were working on requests from last november itll be a few more months until we get to yours
9355500 right now were working on claims that came in during february
9355501 weve taken extraordinary steps with the reform process and now were working out the kinks with the new system
9355502 even when theres no budget in place unclaimed property payments can still go out its one of those programs thats not tied to the budget
9355503 even if its withdrawing or depositing a dollar once a year anything to keep that account active
9355504 i had to go door to door in corporate offices looking for new overnight express services customers
9355505 it taught me the thing i value most today with all due respect to the balance of life people on the west coast enjoy people on the east coast know how to work
9355506 i consistently worked 12 to 16 hour a day weeks there when i moved back to the west coast i was able to outwork quantitatively and productively many other people
9355507 probably the toughest teamsters organization in the u s out of jamaica new york
9355508 i learned to lead people by establishing relationships and helping them to succeed i had to come to an understanding to accomplish mymanagement objectives i was reliant on the people who worked for me
9355509 was the difference between the real world and the theoretical world of college
9355510 a man is judged by his deeds not by his words
9355511 the whole pattern of atmospheric and wind conditions is very favorable
9355512 if we have any kind of serious damage that disrupts production we will likely see a price spike
9355513 even a small storm would put those islands completely underwater
9355514 i panicked when i realized theyd close after labor day so i started stockpiling extra quarts of it for over the winter
9355515 in some ways only being open at a certain time of the year may make the experience of coming here more special
9355516 most of our help are in high school or college so by the end of august theyre getting ready to head back
9355517 we really have no choice but to close because we just dont have the people to keep the store running
9355518 theres never been a set date that well close one year we closed right on labor day other years weve tried to stay open a few weeks beyond
9355519 as the town thins out it becomes a matter of diminishing returns you may have less people to sell to but the cost of keeping the place running is the same in september and october as it is in july
9355520 but im very big on quality and almost immediately after labor day it gets very quiet on this end of town you end up not having enough people to serve the customers you have
9355521 then at some point you dont have enough customers to make it worthwhile to stay open so we just close
9355522 we have one lady who religiously orders four dozen crumb cakes on labor day
9355523 she said she cant live without them and they freeze great she comes back year after year
9355524 summer isnt something you can put off its fleeting and there are certain aspects of it you have to enjoy while you can thats what i like about coming to the shore
9355525 the shore is an experience a moment a taste and its sad when its over you have to do whatever you can to get by without it until next summer
9355526 dillon mcclernon has what they think is a concussion tests taken on his neck and back came back negative we got pretty lucky
9355527 its a lot of fun and it helps with football it makes you faster stronger and quicker
9355528 that shows the kind of depth we have on this team
9355529 im having more fun now i think than i did when i working
9355530 there are a lot of people who only have social security and its hard for them i think the government should be taking care of them as opposed to taking care of the people who dont want to work
9355531 its gotten to the point where we just need more resources in the community and more alternatives
9355532 its a certainty that there will be an increase in the percentage of the elderly population
9355533 people are living a lot longer and its leading to a lot of other issues and needs
9355534 our older citizens an awful lot of them dont have access to the kind of transportation they need
9355535 there are throughout the county who are trying to figure out how to get to their dialysis appointments there are people who are trying to figure out how to buy their groceries
9355536 its going to make it increasingly difficult over say the next 10 years or so for people who have elderly parents to find the kind of placement they are looking for
9355537 they are a generation that didnt believe in sitting around and wasting time
9355538 theyve contributed all their lives and they still want to contribute
9355539 as an intelligence system that combines security awareness with cross cultural skills
9355540 people of all ethnic backgrounds should also be aware of the potential for hate crimes because of skin color religion and country of origin
9355541 i had to go door to door in corporate offices looking for new overnight express services customers
9355542 it taught me the thing i value most today with all due respect to the balance of life people on the west coast enjoy people on the east coast know how to work
9355543 i consistently worked 12 to 16 hour a day weeks there when i moved back to the west coast i was able to outwork quantitatively and productively many other people
9355544 probably the toughest teamsters organization in the u s out of jamaica new york
9355545 i learned to lead people by establishing relationships and helping them to succeed i had to come to an understanding to accomplish mymanagement objectives i was reliant on the people who worked for me
9355546 at the end of the day there are far more independent and undeclared voters who vote for candidates
9355547 our biggest and primary focus is kicking off this last eight week sprint to get john mccain elected president
9355548 she is a governor who appeals to the independent middle
9355549 will look to sarah palin as a fellow traveler with john mccain on the road to reform
9355550 she clearly has the judgment to be one of our nations most effective and popular governors
9355551 she is a tough executive who knows how to bring together democrats and republicans new jersey can identify with this ticket that really will reform washington
9355552 to show the true breadth of support sen mccain enjoys
9355553 it was a fantastic race from james and i am really pleased to see him back up there fighting as we know he can do
9355554 when he suffers the whole team suffers and it is not been an easy period for him but he has never let his head drop and he always kept his motivation and given tech 3 yamaha and michelin 100 per cent
9355555 this result will give him a big boost for the remainder of the season and maybe a podium is not impossible before the end he came under a lot of pressure but he kept concentrated and showed the james we saw at the start of the season
9355556 coming from where id been in the last few races and to produce a ride like that was brilliant
9355557 that is what im here for and i really enjoyed it i was about ten feet wide on those last few laps and probably the widest yamaha in history
9355558 michelin has had a lot of stick recently but they have knuckled down and so have i we have kept working hard and today we showed what we can achieve together with tech 3 and yamaha
9355559 i thought it was going to be tough but not that tough and obviously i wanted to do better for my guys at tech 3 who tried everything to solve some of our issues here
9355560 unfortunately some of the issues we cant control and i was struggling for grip in the early stages
9355561 this morning i had the spin and just wasnt able to make up the gap to mikko i thought it was over and we lost the chance
9355562 but then it all changed and we were leading again but this was really a difficult rally changing all the time with some strategy coming in too
9355563 i needed to win for sure and thats very nice but im not happy for what happened to mikko because he was doing really well and it was a good battle but okay its a race and these things happen sometimes
9355564 i was really confident before whaanga coast that we were going to win this rally but what could we do
9355565 we had a slow puncture that dropped us to third
9355566 thats how it is now im not going to let this knock my confidence i know we can win rallies the season isnt over yet so we just have to go flat out again on the next rallies
9355567 it was a long long left and i went in the wrong camber
9355568 when i pushed the car was spinning spinning spinning and i couldnt stop it i lost a lot of time
9355569 do something outlandish to splash out and to be freer than ever
9355570 a funny thing happened on the way to the forum
9355571 every day in high school he got up very early to drive to los angeles buy produce drive back home set the produce up do his homework go to school work after school in the store and go to bed
9355572 then hed get up and do it all over again
9355573 a lot of people say that he could have been one of the great presidents
9355574 i wonder i do but i know this he is a character of shakespearean dimension
9355575 the rain is not so intense but there is a lot a lot of wind
9355576 the officials they have told us the wind will be bad first but then the rain could cause flooding into the night
9355577 its very big and weve got to get ready for whats coming
9355578 if you dont shape up whack youll wind up selling ribbons at kresges
9355579 too many students are short credits and lose interest and hope
9355580 theres a lot more leniency and a lot less work in credit recovery
9355581 kids know that if they fail they can do the class again in six weeks
9355582 as long as you show up youre not gonna fail
9355583 a credit for johnny is not a credit for janey
9355584 the integrity of the credit is in trouble across the province
9355585 at the end of the semester i have kids who say what have i missed what do i need to do to pass
9355586 kids are late to class more often than not but you cant do anything about it and they know it ive tried giving them a quiz at the beginning of the class but then parents say you have to give them a chance to make it up you cant deduct marks you can ask them to stay for a detention but they dont come im always asking teachers what do you do but theres nothing
9355587 theyve been building better stadiums subways airports roads and parks and weve been building better metal detectors armoured humvees and pilotless drones
9355588 will not yield to absolute dogmas or outworn slogans they cannot be moved by those who cling to a spirit that is already dying
9355589 when i was a kid i thought my parents jobs were boring
9355590 you always had to be so quiet on the set
9355591 i liked to hang out in the dance studio instead and watch the dancers
9355592 it must have already been up for a while because i didnt even see chita rivera in it
9355593 i just loved it and i thought yes this is what i want to do i knew i belonged on broadway
9355594 when we were in new york instead of at home in california we always stayed at the plaza
9355595 but i think all kids like to play with hotel mail chutes
9355596 talk to people in music and look at the respect you see in their faces just at the mention of kays name
9355597 cars merge from all directions everyone just as clueless as to which side theyre forced to merge to
9355598 would it be too difficult for caltrans to paint some arrows on the ground giving us some sort of forewarning that we should be watching out for that car on our left because our two lanes will be merging in less than 20 feet and that after that well be merging with the car on our right in another 10 feet
9355599 we are currently looking at an enhanced system of lane stripings comprised of solid stripes for lane lines that continue and do not require merge and broken stripes for lane lines that do merge as a solution the solid or broken lane stripings on the right or left will remain easily understandable and visible at all times and can help guide motorists through the area we plan to implement this improvement on the bay bridge when feasible during future construction staging on the new bay bridge project
9355600 the body toxic how the hazardous chemistry of everyday things threatens our health and well being
9355601 adventures of the great chiweenie biking across america with a pack of teenagers
9355602 does not ask us to believe things in a philosophical sense but to imagine them in an artistic sense
9355603 thanks to free indirect style we see things through the characters eyes and language but also through the authors eyes and language we inhabit omniscience and partiality at once
9355604 is an example of aestheticism the author gets in the way which is at bottom the strenuous display of style
9355605 forster is genially snobbish about flat characters and wants to demote them reserving the highest category for rounder or fuller characters
9355606 the very idea of roundness in characterization tyrannizes us readers novelists critics with an impossible ideal
9355607 commercial realism has cornered the market has become the most powerful brand in fiction
9355608 the efficiency of the thriller genre takes just what it needs from the much less efficient flaubert or isherwood and throws away what made those writers truly alive
9355609 lifeness life on the page life brought to different life by the highest artistry
9355610 maybe being big and being good at soccer were not the same
9355611 an open door policy with all of us he wants you to come in and talk to him about whatever is on your mind
9355612 if theres anything he doesnt approve of youre going to run at the end
9355613 im bracing myself for whats going to happen the good thing is that ive gotten a lot of support from the roman administration
9355614 the one thing the coaches preached was doing things the right way
9355615 and once you stepped inside the lines of the field it was all about football and winning they had an all business approach
9355616 he probably makes us run a little more than coach murph
9355617 from everything im hearing were too young from the coaches on down
9355618 but im confident we have a lot of good talent the important thing for us is to get the younger guys to stay focused in practices and games throughout the year
9355619 the good thing is that were flying under the radar right now
9355620 everything you hear about is st josephs prep and cardinal ohara if people want to make us the underdogs thats fine with us
9355621 are those alive oh my god i thought they were fake
9355622 if any city has had a long and intimate association with insects its definitely new orleans
9355623 in some texas pastures alone they clear out 80 percent of all cow manure
9355624 he runs around he is a very tough kid for not being very big
9355625 running c passing f i really failed on that one
9355626 it is unlikely to be reasonable for the tenant to continue to occupy the accommodation beyond the date given in the section 21 notice
9355627 theres definitely a chance this is not the final roster we have to wait and see
9355628 they say to themselves im gonna be on espn2 and that plays with their heads
9355629 its because its a family beach and mini golf is a wholesome family activity
9355630 you could argue that it all started at an amusement park in the 40s
9355631 sometimes the kids get it in their heads to use the clubs to break them
9355632 the only time ill get mad is when you disrespect me
9355633 there was this one guy who came in here and told me i had a chicken expletive little job
9355634 all we know is they must have missed their jump site
9355635 we dont know anything until the x rays come back
9355636 yalls heart yalls spirit yall mean a whole lot to me
9355637 its a crunch for us and were at the maximum that we can charge
9355638 were not going to buy romaine lettuce or leaf lettuce for a little while
9355639 were going to have to stick to plain old iceberg for a while
9355640 with the turkey ham you put it on a sandwich add more lettuce cheese and tomato to make it a little more edible
9355641 if you have a couple of children you maybe cant afford to have them buy the few times a week they used to
9355642 i have two kids and you double the cost every week now its 3 a day so no way
9355643 were serving things that require a little bit more labor theyre a little bit more costly
9355644 were looking at what type of bread were using and maybe replacing it with something less expensive
9355645 it was a rather small offering there were a few fruits but there wasnt any cheese on it
9355646 they say they would like lobster and shrimp on the menu but unfortunately we cant accommodate them
9355647 as the prime minister said in february the government has full confidence in commissioner keelty that position has not changed
9355648 police said they were pursuing inquiries and i dont think its safe to simply assume that those inquiries may only have been specifically in relation tothe united kingdom
9355649 look at what the afp said at the time the amount of email information and communications they were looking at ive forgotten the precise quantum but we were talking emails that ran to something like the equivalent of 30 000 pages that had to be read
9355650 the afp is a thoroughly professional organisation that doesnt mean to say mistakes arent made from time to time inquiries dont always lead to prosecutions or convictions and the timing of them really can depend on a whole range of things
9355651 andrews going to take some time to reflect on whats happened
9355652 hes still committed to playing cricket at the highest level
9355653 hes had success there and is a very good player of spin and that is important
9355654 i hope he can return i certainly do hes an integral part of the team a great guy to have around
9355655 but we need him 100 per cent committed to the team and im hoping he can sort out any issues hes got going on
9355656 we want to allow him to demonstrate he is committed to doing all those things you need to if youre to be part of the worlds best cricket team
9355657 obviously i didnt see it but if he did it then it is a very serious matter
9355658 spitting is pretty much one of the worst things you can do on the pitch
9355659 getting the penalty against us was bad enough but then to be sent off and leave us with 10 men thats ill discipline he should have walked away after he got the yellow card
9355660 he let the team the fans and the club down and i had some very hard words to say to him at half time
9355661 i have to accept the responsibility that the biggest contributing factor to that has been us
9355662 we are going to have to improve a long way on our last road trip
9355663 everyone has thought peter costello would either resign from parliament to take up a job or stay on and become leader of the opposition
9355664 im very much looking forward to reading mr costellos book particularly the chapters about the extreme workchoices regime the 16 year high inflation and the 12 straight rate rises he gave the australian people
9355665 and if mr costello becomes opposition leader ill relish debating that record in full
9355666 id relish the opportunity each and every day to remind the australian public hes the architect of workchoices
9355667 happy to export yellow cake through fremantle or any of our regional ports
9355668 when last in government he pushed the barrow for foreign companies who wanted to ship their radioactive waste to wa and bury it in our backyard
9355669 lets be very clear about this the only thing standing in the way of uranium mining in western australia is a re elected labor government
9355670 we didnt speak about the potential the possibilities really we had to win to not go interstate and play a final
9355671 most programs focus on the few individuals who have the most dramatic changes in appearance thus exaggerating the likelihood of positive outcomes
9355672 complications infections and failed procedures are barely mentioned giving the impression that negative outcomes are rare
9355673 too close to labor and thats not good for lyne
9355674 three weeks ago i was a liberal stooge this week im a labor stooge the only stooge i can accurately be accused of being is the communitys stooge
9355675 i have never supported electricity privatisation either in public or in private
9355676 i want to make it absolutely clear that everything we require of public schools we will require of non government schools and everything we require of non government schools we will require of public schools
9355677 the framework we seek is a truly national one which will give parents the public and government information about every school it is only by covering every school can we truly satisfy ourselves that we understand the quality of schooling experienced by every child and can lift the quality of schooling across the board
9355678 so we can properly analyse what difference extra resources make
9355679 these will not lead to the creation of dumb league tables that tell us little but to smart reports that show us how well each school is meeting agreed standards compared with schools with similar enrolments and challenges
9355680 i know that these changes will be unsettling for some many schools are reluctant to have problems highlighted or be compared to other schools even similar schools but we make no excuses
9355681 well judge it on the same basis as weve judged the first proposal and that is the public interest
9355682 were concerned mr iemma cant make the case given that hes refusing to bring it to parliament
9355683 if we cant make our minds up over a commercial policy that is so fundamental and basic over eight months how can the business community have any confidence in us
9355684 i was playing great this is the biggest win for me
9355685 but i tried to tell myself that i am playing david and hes no4 in the world that made me feel kind of happy and think more positive
9355686 i was tired too so i just tried to fight in the fifth set
9355687 he is a very good player he serves very well
9355688 i fought a lot but nishikori played better than me
9355689 today i served very well i have more confidence and i hope to continue to improve my tennis i know i have to keep improving my tennis if i want to win
9355690 that gave me a lot of confidence that i could win
9355691 he was playing well in that moment but after that i started playing better and he made some mistakes
9355692 ive gotten a lot better since then he has too
9355693 i can go out there and rip away i have nothing to lose
9355694 too much on the liberal side small l that is
9355695 honour of the appointment carries with it great responsibility which i willingly accept
9355696 our concern is that while the government has changed the way things operate in many places managers in the public sector are acting as though it is business as usual
9355697 we are fighting this war this is our war there is no question of americas dictation
9355698 the operation in swat is in high gear but the holy months sanctity requires that people spend it in peace and harmony
9355699 in africa we just keep recycling the same old people so change isnt welcome let people who are unique who are young who have ideas let them come up
9355700 we cant vote for you but we can pray for you
9355701 originally stepping out of kenya africa adopted into the cold woodlands of america dem youthboy defied every order and turned a senator
9355702 obama obama obama he is an american why are you looking at him and not yourself why dont you build your strength here
9355703 i like him because of the things he stands for he stands for hope that anyone can live their dreams if they believe in themselves
9355704 it is a statement that regardless of ones background who your dad or mother is or how you grew up you can do something for yourself
9355705 you cannot sit back and wallow in misery you can always make good of something no matter what circumstances you are facing
9355706 obama is truly a new american note american who stands on all the delicate cutting edges of americas murky politics
9355707 it is unhelpful to own him via silly tribal fundraising projects from africa that in itself is begging for ownership of some kind
9355708 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9355709 a lot of people may choose that they dont want to take a risk they know how quickly weather can change and that may discourage a lot of travelers from traveling any distance this weekend
9355710 we want to get home before the contra flow starts
9355711 a lot of cancellations were going on but its now picking up
9355712 we want an agreement to end the israeli occupation and establish an independent palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital
9355713 president abbas told olmert that we will not be part of an interim or shelf agreement
9355714 either we agree on all issues or no agreement at all
9355715 the most critical issue that threatens the whole peace process now
9355716 any country that has a potential separatist movement will view the events in georgia through its own unique prism
9355717 but the greatest cause for concern lies in the ukraine azerbaijan and moldova all states that border russia
9355718 by illegally recognizing the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force
9355719 we have our western friends and those in central asia who are not in agreement with russian actions but we also have a strong relationship with russia
9355720 three pink pills or three shards of mirror to swallow
9355721 three pink pills or three shards of mirror to swallow
9355722 i was too young for woodstock i didnt really start going to concerts until my youngest son was old enough
9355723 i am almost 50 years old and i certainly dont want to be condemned i dont want to be looked upon as some kind of used up dude
9355724 we created this scene we deserve to be there we belong there
9355725 i think its pretty remarkable that i get to see people that are below 9 showing up at our festival and then people in their 50s showing up at our festival and they all seem to appreciate and enjoy the music across the board
9355726 i think our partners have always pretty much stood by the fact that were a family festival
9355727 obviously lollapalooza for the last four years hasnt been like lollapalooza of the early 90s
9355728 we are a company of 25 38 as well and we know what we were going to want to go do if we were going to pay the money turns out thats who come to our festivals too
9355729 but we always keep in mind that its getting a little older and thats very interesting especially for lollapalooza
9355730 theres certainly some thought that goes into how do we make the event as broad as possible
9355731 technology was never a goal for howard jones it was a vehicle he used to express changing perceptions of reality in a continuously poetic and artistic manner
9355732 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9355733 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9355734 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9355735 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9355736 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9355737 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9355738 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9355739 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9355740 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9355741 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9355742 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9355743 gustav is a large system similar to katrina the difference at this moment is that its asymmetric it doesnt have a uniform coverage like katrina
9355744 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding
9355745 my message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9355746 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9355747 if you cant do the time dont do the crime
9355748 if you wont spend the dime dont whine about crime
9355749 when the ana afghan army and coalition troops got close to the village firing started after the ana unit stopped and the coalition forces conducted the operation in the village
9355750 among the victims there is not any foreign or internal taliban
9355751 any country that has a potential separatist movement will view the events in georgia through its own unique prism
9355752 but the greatest cause for concern lies in the ukraine azerbaijan and moldova all states that border russia
9355753 by illegally recognizing the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force
9355754 we have our western friends and those in central asia who are not in agreement with russian actions but we also have a strong relationship with russia
9355755 singulair is a really effective drug that has been on the market 10 years and has been taken by millions of patients
9355756 in over 40 placebo controlled trials no reports of suicide in singulair treated groups have been found
9355757 the evidence is good but we couldnt call it perfect
9355758 when you dont know what to look for its pretty sad
9355759 he began talking about losing the desire to practice medicine even though it was a great passion of his
9355760 for a guy who was such a family man to do that in a way that would basically ensure his family would be the first to find him was completely baffling
9355761 neurontin is an important medicine that has helped millions of patients with serious conditions
9355762 based on an extensive review of our clinical trial data for neurontin we see no evidence to support the claim that neurontin causes an increased risk of suicide related events
9355763 even though a drug is identified as a drug for weight control or smoking cessation or asthma these drugs often also get into the brain so there is always the potential for having psychiatric side effects
9355764 but we dont have any unifying hypothesis as to why very different classes of drugs have psychiatric side effects
9355765 i cant see any reason why it should not be widely and regularly used during drug development
9355766 it has been validated and appears to be a technique that is not expensive
9355767 there is no compelling reason to think that more than a few are associated with suicidality
9355768 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9355769 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9355770 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9355771 three cups of tea greg mortenson and david oliver relin
9355772 they think every tamil speaking person is a terrorist they want to control us
9355773 no one suggests for the moment that there should not be security measures and precautions
9355774 at the same time we need to be a lot more serious in finding the balance between democratic rights and human rights and the right security measures we cant alienate an entire community an entire section of the citizenry
9355775 the root cause of this is the unresolved ethnic issue
9355776 it is not a bed of roses you have to undergo certain kinds of inconveniences
9355777 i really dont think it is discrimination it is for their own good
9355778 there were so many threats to colombo and the vicinity therefore we had to carry out search operations
9355779 there was always a great love there as well as a bit of annoyance
9355780 its like being married you know for that long you just kind of get sick of the other person
9355781 its kind of tough being a partner when your partner does a movie without you
9355782 after that he sort of went his way and i went my way
9355783 its like turning an oil tanker around you know you dont stop on a dime and speed up 180 degrees in the other direction you kind of start doing it one gig at a time
9355784 im actually just starting to get back into making money
9355785 i would be offered marijuana by snitches and then i would be drug tested an hour or two later
9355786 when they arrested me they thought for sure that i had a lot of prior arrests and they thought i was this pothead idiot you know they thought i was my character basically
9355787 were at the age that we just dont want to argue anymore
9355788 so we decided not to have a personality conflict anymore
9355789 we want an agreement to end the israeli occupation and establish an independent palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital
9355790 president abbas told olmert that we will not be part of an interim or shelf agreement
9355791 either we agree on all issues or no agreement at all
9355792 it really is pretty here and the weather has been great
9355793 denvers hickenlooper primed for prime time well liked mayor seen as next bright star
9355794 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9355795 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9355796 senator mccain has already indicated that it would be inappropriate to have celebrations that things have to be scaled back
9355797 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9355798 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9355799 because shes a reformer and she thinks outside the box the way my husband does
9355800 you know washington is just a quagmire its a mess right now and both of them have been serious reformers
9355801 alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here its also about making decisions and be targeted in what she thinks she has a great mind and she has a very serious direction in where she goes
9355802 andrews going to take some time to reflect on whats happened
9355803 hes still committed to playing cricket at the highest level
9355804 how he goes about doing that and how it plays out i dont know whether it means india i dont know
9355805 hes had success there and is a very good player of spin and that is important
9355806 he had his chances over the course of the game he probably had 10 shots on goal
9355807 i dont think he had a goal at half time and he ended up kicking seven which is a pretty special effort in itself
9355808 seven goals in a half of footy its a tough brutal game and he was unable to get there at the end
9355809 i suppose maybe we could have done that at the start on franklin i suppose thats the way he clarkson has seen it
9355810 he copped a bit of a knock to a hip i think so hell be ok he could have come back on but it was about the 20 minute mark of the last quarter so hell be ok
9355811 i dont reckon therell be too many guys who wont be putting their hand up for next weeks game
9355812 fala couldnt come since he wouldnt promise to be quiet
9355813 he must have gone in there to get his paycheck
9355814 whether he spat at the referee or spat on the ground i dont know ill have to see the video footage
9355815 that would give him two weeks to the 1800 metre race the underwood stakes
9355816 hes got to butter up either at his next run or the run after so i think i might run him next week which would give him two weeks into the underwood
9355817 we want to take one at a time and the caulfield cup comes first a week before the cox plate and thats our main goal at the moment
9355818 he ate up well last night and had ten minutes on the treadmill this morning
9355819 so there we were 14 of us in the family section and the vendor came through selling cracker jack
9355820 it was the fourth inning and suddenly the song was in my head buy me some peanuts and cracker jack and it sounded good
9355821 first of all you dont get any peanuts until you get to the bottom of the bag and you only get six of them
9355822 i was making it out to be this big thing i remember years ago the prize would be a little secret decoder ring or a toy of some kind or a baseball card i guess those days are gone
9355823 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men are created equal just words we have nothing to fear but fear itself just words just speeches
9355824 i am not asking anybody to take a chance on me im asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations
9355825 im not just asking you to take a chance on me im also asking you to take a chance on your own aspirations
9355826 if there is a child on the south side of chicago who cant read that matters to me even if its not my child
9355827 it is that fundamental belief i am my brothers keeper i am my sisters keeper that makes this country work its what allows us to pursue our individual dreams and yet still come together as one american family
9355828 we believe we must be the family of america recognizing that at the heart of the matter we are bound one to another that the problems of a retired school teacher in duluth are our problems that the future of the child in buffalo is our future that the struggle of a disabled man in boston to survive and live decently is our struggle that the hunger of a woman in little rock is our hunger that the failure anywhere to provide what reasonably we might to avoid pain is our failure
9355829 but my grandfather had larger dreams for his son through hard work and perseverance my father got a scholarship to study in a magical place america that shone as a beacon of freedom and opportunity to so many who had come before
9355830 and they too had big dreams for their daughter a common dream born of two continents my parents shared not only an improbable love they shared an abiding faith in the possibilities of this nation they imagined me going to the best schools in the land even though they werent rich because in a generous america you dont have to be rich to achieve your potential theyre both passed away now and yet i know that on this night they look down on me with great pride
9355831 i watched a small man with thick calluses on both his hands work 15 and 16 hours a day i saw him once literally bleed from the bottoms of his feet a man who came here uneducated alone unable to speak the language who taught me all i needed to know about faith and hard work by the simple eloquence of his example i learned about our kind of democracy from my father and i learned about our obligation to each other from him and from my mother they asked only for a chance to work and to make the world better for their children and they they asked to be protected in those moments when they would not be able to protect themselves this nation and this nations government did that for them
9355832 and that they were able to build a family and live in dignity and see one of their children go from behind their little grocery store in south jamaica on the other side of the tracks where he was born to occupy the highest seat in the greatest state in the greatest nation in the only world we would know is an ineffably beautiful tribute to the democratic process
9355833 we have more work to do more work to do for the workers i met in galesburg illinois who are losing their union jobs at the maytag plant thats moving to mexico and now are having to compete with their own children for jobs that pay seven bucks an hour more to do for the father that i met who was losing his job and choking back the tears wondering how he would pay 4 500 dollars a month for the drugs his son needs without the health benefits that he counted on more to do for the young woman in east st louis and thousands more like her who has the grades has the drive has the will but doesnt have the money to go to college
9355834 maybe mr president if you visited some more places maybe if you went to appalachia where some people still live in sheds maybe if you went to lackawanna where thousands of unemployed steel workers wonder why we subsidized foreign steel maybe mr president if you stopped in at a shelter in chicago and spoke to the homeless there maybe mr president if you asked a woman who had been denied the help she needed to feed her children because you said you needed the money for a tax break for a millionaire or for a missile we couldnt afford to use
9355835 maybe if john mccain went to pennsylvania and he met the man who lost his job but cant even afford the gas to drive around and look for a new one hed understand we cant afford four more years of our addiction to oil from dictators
9355836 maybe if he went to iowa and met the student who works the night shift after a full day of class and still cant pay the medical bills for his sister whos ill hed understand she cant afford four more years of a health care plan that only takes care of the healthy and the wealthy
9355837 i havent spent most of my life in politics as most of you know but ive spent enough time in washington to know how much we need to change washington
9355838 i havent spent a lot of time learning the ways of washington but ive been there long enough to know that the ways of washington must change
9355839 a little critter that gets in and messes with the flow of the sap to the tree
9355840 the netherlands is already kind of resigned to the fact theyre going to have to build giant dikes around the country
9355841 the anticipated 2 to 3 foot rise in sea level over the next 100 years will cause salt water to flow 10 miles or more inland right into the everglades
9355842 food teaches us so much about culture through what and how we eat
9355843 the food is such a part of an artistic movement in cuisine
9355844 with chemistry cooking like pur ed peas made to resemble delicate caviar beads there are 38 courses of bites that i want to see taste and experience as well as observe from behind the scenes in the kitchen
9355845 its also full of very rich and very poor people great food great tropical weather and a safe distance from honolulu
9355846 one should be as humble and respectful in the water with the locals as you can or else
9355847 teahupoo tahiti bells beach australia and jeffreys bay south africa all three are storied treasured places in pro surfings world championship tour
9355848 ive been about four times and have seen and photographed stars like will smith george clooney and jack nicholson there is such an extreme excitement that television viewers dont always see as everyday people experience the stellar presence of their favorite celebrities from the bleachers
9355849 i was there for the last concert of the pacific symphonys european tour in 2006
9355850 the decorative structure dates from the early years of the 20th century
9355851 i went there for the first time when i was in college bought a standing room ticket and heard boris godunov for the first time
9355852 the concertgebouw is a very historic and acoustically beautiful hall with wonderful music id love to hear the concertgebouw orchestra play a mahler symphony there thats one of its specialties
9355853 the sun never sets as you climb amid glaciers snow and ice near the arctic circle
9355854 it is truly amazing to be standing on the roof of north america
9355855 i have had the experience of climbing with individuals from argentina germany ireland australia and more when you share a two man tent with three other people for weeks at a time without showers you really have get along the pure and simple joy of mountain climbing is the simplicity of the journey up and the journey down everyday life is so complicated and climbing is just about enjoying the journey not rushing to the summit
9355856 loreto is a tiny town of about 14 000 with fishing and a laid back attitude
9355857 the marine life such as whales dolphins and sea otters dwelling in the nearby sea of cortez is incredible
9355858 i prefer the sleepy towns since they offer relaxation when you are visiting from a big city
9355859 cabo and some of the northern resort areas are geared more toward partying and drinking
9355860 you can find whatever you want in baja and the smaller unspoiled places are available for enjoyment and unwinding
9355861 theres something special about knowing that ted williams once played there or joe dimaggio
9355862 anyone who considers himself a baseball fan should visit the classic stadiums yankee stadium fenway park and wrigley field before its too late
9355863 i loved it as a kid and would enjoy sharing it with my sons
9355864 its a magical space covered stage and galleries open orchestra
9355865 seeing a shakespeare play there makes you feel as if youve taken a trip back in time to 1600
9355866 the ricardo montalban formerly the doolittle is old and actually stinky with bad sightlines blech also i hate the canon in beverly hills the seats are so confusingly numbered that people fight over whose spot is whose and in new york the zippertheater actually uses old van seats for the audience its torture to sit in them
9355867 i like summer festivals and venues that have a lot of history to them
9355868 the must cruise especially for west coast residents should be to alaska
9355869 exciting shore excursions from helicoptering over glaciers to riding an old steam train to a gold mining campsite each port is fun and worth walking around
9355870 my dream is to go around south america and antarctica
9355871 i sat with them during rehearsals watched the ceremony backstage and then went with them and their families to a celebratory dinner
9355872 it is a logistical nightmare and not a lot of fun he said
9355873 what would be more fun would be to be part of jack nicholsons entourage when he goes to cannes his per diem on promotional trips is legendary
9355874 rundown shea stadium home of the mets where its not uncommon to find exposed electrical wires in the press box and dont forget the rats to riding the 7 train to and from the stadium to times square
9355875 you felt that the game was being played in a warehouse
9355876 my favorite hiking experience thus far in 51 years has been a through hike of the john muir trail in the sierra nevada it is 208 miles of the most beautiful landscape in california i did the whole thing in 2001 and shot 120 rolls of film recording the daily beauty
9355877 id love to explore the kamchatka peninsula in russia it is a stunningly beautiful land of volcanoes and virgin forests filled with big bears and wolves
9355878 its a visually stunning city to walk around with tremendous architecture and monuments
9355879 i must tell you this is the mother of all storms im not sure weve ever seen anything like it
9355880 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9355881 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9355882 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9355883 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9355884 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9355885 new orleans will not have a shelter of last resort
9355886 this is the case of any emergency as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9355887 if you choose to stay despite an evacuation order youll have limited resources you cant call 911 and expect someone to help
9355888 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9355889 we all hope a few days from now that this is just the best practice run we could have had
9355890 hes a 21 year old that we expect to be an important member of this organization
9355891 you have to perform at some point and it happens to be tuesday against a very good team lets see what he has well find out a lot about where were at with him in the next month
9355892 he came in and felt worse than he did friday
9355893 a sensational and talented force in the kitchen and we know our attendees will benefit from her expertise and experience we are looking forward to see what she whips up
9355894 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9355895 when it comes down to it it really just became a durability issue
9355896 if you cant count on someone for whatever reason its a tough call
9355897 i just feel like im better than the practice squad right now
9355898 but my spirits are good i feel good inside im just ready to play
9355899 they might be bringing me back for the practice squad
9355900 you have to start somewhere ive always wanted to be a 49er ive been a fan all my life
9355901 now that sign isnt posted out in front of the stadium
9355902 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9355903 i asked her how do you feel about this this is two things you have to do is not only possibly be a vice presidential candidate but also you know listen to worry about your son
9355904 and she looked me square in the eye and she said you know something
9355905 we cant let it go we cant let a country come back in and take it back down to a soviet style government this is democracy and thats what were all about
9355906 when the ana afghan army and coalition troops got close to the village firing started after the ana unit stopped and the coalition forces conducted the operation in the village
9355907 among the victims there is not any foreign or internal taliban
9355908 we can no longer live we cant be safe anywhere
9355909 i hope those in government do their jobs otherwise they should resign
9355910 we ask authorities with all our heart to be more sensitive maybe nothing like this has happened to them or they would be more sensitive
9355911 are those alive oh my god i thought they were fake
9355912 if any city has had a long and intimate association with insects its definitely new orleans
9355913 in some texas pastures alone they clear out 80 percent of all cow manure
9355914 governor palin has the record of reform and bipartisanship that others can only speak of her experience in shaking up the status quo is exactly what is needed in washington today
9355915 yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9355916 an our strongest winds blow through canyons affecting narrow areas of southern california
9355917 p sate por moncloa nos tomamos unas cervezas y hablamos
9355918 es la primera vez que un presidente europeo se atreve a grabar un programa as
9355919 quiero mostrar a un zapatero m s informal es un t o maj simo y queremos mostrar su faceta m s entra able nada que ver con sus comparecencias serias
9355920 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
9355921 ahora a trabajar y tambi n conviene que consum is
9355922 admiro a la monta a y a los monta eros por ser deporte que cuida y preserva la naturaleza y donde se valora el esfuerzo y est presente la solidaridad
9355923 un antiguo compromiso de volver al valle de valde n y a un lugar tan bello como collado jermoso
9355924 hay que estimular y apoyar todo lo que representa este
9355925 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
9355926 winning the first one is always a big confidence builder
9355927 theres no way you can simulate that quickness and speed in practice
9355928 we did a good job eliminating a lot of mental mistakes
9355929 weve put in countless hours in trying to get better
9355930 our ultimate goal is to win the section championship so weve been doing everything we can to get to that point
9355931 its been real slow going trying to get people to uproot their lives
9355932 that being said i think the project has still been tremendous these are the best freedom activists in the word that are coming here the moving aspect is a good screening process
9355933 the free state project appealed to us because it represented a real opportunity to work together with a high concentration of people who really valued freedom something that simply doesnt exist in california
9355934 they are forced to show their hand to show that they are the violent organization of men and women they really are or ignore us and hope we go away
9355935 if they ignore us we win if they arrest us we win
9355936 im really encouraged by the fact that at least were communicating and sharing ideas behind the scenes
9355937 he got a fastball up to bruce and he put a backup slider right in pattersons wheelhouse we had the matchups he couldnt make a pitch
9355938 its got to be location because the stuff is still there
9355939 im throwing beach balls up there ive not gotten anyone out its embarrassing that we score that many runs and cant get a win
9355940 i was trying to calm myself down i thought i relaxed very well after that
9355941 that was one of the best seven innings weve had from our young pitchers this year maybe the best
9355942 you know there a lot of rich people who arent happy id rather be happy
9355943 you know if i were a wise person i could probably figure out how to be happy and maybe even how to be rich
9355944 righteousness righteousness shall you pursue so that you will live and possess the land that the almighty your god gives you
9355945 the torah obliges us to trust wholeheartedly in god but not in man a person must always be on the alert not to be cheated
9355946 ey h rru hoppa in h r ska jag skjutsa
9355947 men tja det r juh du du r v n med malin eller hur
9355948 people in saxapahaw used to say i know what color theyre dyeing today because the water was green or blue
9355949 and i was the one and only the first and last ever to be under contract to rodgers and
9355950 thats where i met my knight in shining armor my prince on a white horse mr cassidy
9355951 but it wasnt just doing the show together every night
9355952 it was getting to actually live together in new york city together at our ages that was a wonderful experience for a mother and son to go through
9355953 you couldnt stop him for a second and hes still that way
9355954 i was also hell bent on getting a car when i turned 16
9355955 i thought great how am i going to earn that working at swensons ice cream store

9355957 i sing that song in my favorite things and every time im knocked out
9355958 i mean heres this song about racism and its saying its not something were born with that you have to be taught to hate and they wrote that in the late 40s wow that to me is just incredible
9355959 oh whats the use of wondering if hes good or if hes bad hes your feller and you love him thats all there is to that
9355960 my brothers and i say you know mom if ever there was a signature tune thats your song
9355961 you know john if you just come and see my favorite things youll hear all these stories
9355962 well i think i know the music but i dont know the words and of course here i was talking to the lyricist
9355963 a little bit of a lecherous guy who chased all the pretty girls around the room
9355964 its got a good script and god knows its got incredible music
9355965 but it will be here long after were all gone
9355966 little kids come up to me all the time and say i saw you in
9355967 its the kind of music that will be with us forever
9355968 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada

9355973 i had started earning enough money by writing the steve allen show to get my own new york city pad
9355974 that man who climbed mount everest lost his entire nose
9355975 this morning i made her pancakes and milk 2 then she left

9355980 your mother and i noticed patty had on a pea coat like yours and we read shes 53
9355981 suppose the house burned down this afternoon why do i need an extra quarter pound of butter
9355982 winning today means you get to race in the championship meet next week right
9355983 oh come on danny dont tell me you actually believe in that superstitious mumbo jumbo you didnt win that race today or any day because of some little green flower you won because you trained hard and god gave you a strong healthy body that can run fast
9355984 but i know i won because of my magic lucky charm and its my charm thats going to bring me the gold in the championship race
9355985 danny are you okay should i call mom should i call an ambulance
9355986 i didnt get hurt or anything just while i was working out i i checked my pocket to make sure my magic lucky charm was there and its its gone now im crawling all around to see if it fell on the floor around here im really desperate to find it
9355987 danny give me a break its just a silly superstitious nothing and it has nothing to do with what youre going to do in the race
9355988 you dont understand the championship race is tomorrow and if i dont find it im sunk
9355989 danny i want you to remember its all up to you and gods help whether youre going to win today or not
9355990 i imagine youd want to put this in your pocket
9355991 yeah once i got my charm i became a new person ill bet from now on youll believe me about it
9355992 it makes it seem more like a real college instead of a community college
9355993 it might attract more people to come to the school
9355994 we watched him play since he was five years old and it just continues our family tradition of being able to watch our son play soccer
9355995 hmm this stuff looks pretty good i think ill have some right now
9355996 im doing a tap dance what do you think im doing im eating what does it look like
9355997 look im hungry and the food is yummy why dont you have some of yours too itll put you in a better mood
9355998 no way im saving all my stuff until i absolutely have to have some thats the way to do things right sandy
9355999 okay guys everyone out time to hit the nature trail
9356000 how can a person be expected to hike a trail on a packed stomach
9356001 who told you to pack your stomach in the first place
9356002 that last growl was loud enough to wake up a hibernating bear
9356003 but im sort of out of stuff anyway my stomachs still really hurting
9356004 im waiting until i really need to eat something i just wish i had some more energy and my stupid headache would go away
9356005 i cant wait to get back to camp and finally eat something again
9356006 here you might as well take some of my stuff
9356007 i guess i waited too long because in the end i didnt touch a thing
9356008 i have a laptop i take back and forth to work
9356009 i showed up at the exchange around 9am to meet my usual contact but he wasnt there no one was there apparently the police had come in and forced all of the traders to go and applaud at a hammer throw competition or something i dont even know what that means anyway the only person in the whole place was this kid couldnt have been more than 12 years old but he assured me he was 21 he had the government document to prove it anyway i could see he didnt know what he was talking about so i told him i wanted to buy some gold at 780 dollars an ounce when he processed the trade i couldnt believe it because gold is currently trading at 800 an ounce it was the best trade of my life a personal best
9356010 he makes an okay living i guess but moishe showed me that the real moneys in foreign currency and precious metals i want to be like moishe
9356011 i used to be really into uri geller so i was thinking about becoming a psychic but then i heard about moishe rosenberg and i was like bending a silver spoon is cool and everything but bend some gold geller and then well talk so i decided to write my securities exam
9356012 he will be praised and beloved and others will desire to emulate him this person has sanctified the almighty
9356013 tell everyone to get on and let those in the back pass up their money or cartisiot
9356014 i set before you a blessing and a curse the blessing if you obey the commandments of god the curse if you do not and you follow other gods
9356015 you will slaughter animals according to the manner i god have prescribed
9356016 you are a nation consecrated to god your lord god has chosen you from all nations on the face of the earth to be his own special nation deut 14 1 2
9356017 see i am placing before you this day a blessing and a curse the blessing if you will listen to the commandments of the almighty which i am commanding you this day and the curse if you do not listen to the almightys commandments
9356018 he is speaking to everyone else here i dont have to take what he says seriously since he is not really directing his words to me
9356019 i think his clothes always spoke to very different generations from the youth to the establishment
9356020 through imagery through his campaigns most importantly he always created a product and whatever category it was it was something to be proud of something that you always felt like you wanted to have theres an element of endurance of timelessness
9356021 anything ive wanted to do ive done anyone ive wanted to be with ive had
9356022 we were told by winehouses agent at 8 p m that she would not be there and we were forced to cancel the performance
9356023 we have still not been given any explanation of the exact reasons for her absence we are very sorry about this situation and share the disappointment of the festival goers
9356024 does kay hagan think we believe that elizabeth doles got firepower she just received the best of congress award she saved our military bases and thousands of jobs saved our farmers and gave sheriffs tools to fight illegal immigration
9356025 the school bus will be here in an hour take your scarf and mittens

9356033 my mother in law wants the kids to check in twice a day when were traveling she has a map with pins so she can track us

9356037 my boss chose me to close that big deal in san francisco
9356038 they have the most crooked street in america there and a gazelle you arent you could tumble down like jack and jill splat
9356039 oy such delicious bobka i can hardly walk from that brunch
9356040 so did you take out the lamb chops for dinner
9356041 my mothers from the school that the minute you walk in the house you have to eat
9356042 she asks what can i get you and if i say nothing the question just continues one thanksgiving there were only six of us and she had two 20 pound turkeys plus brisket not to mention the eight sides and 15 pies and cakes and halvah i went on stage that night to do stand up and i just read the menu from her dinner
9356043 did you hear the one about the stupid jew and the drunken mormon
9356044 get out of my sight susie i dont want to see you till 8 at night anonymous
9356045 my father used to beat the hell out of me and all it made me do was fantasize about ways to kill him
9356046 new york is an odd bird its the first to have the top trends but ultimately most new yorkers are staying classic
9356047 its not just about showing off new yorkers are about making guests comfortable and being hospitable that tends toward classic details
9356048 new yorkers look for anything that isnt strapless which leads to lots of cap sleeves v necks and high necks
9356049 this is not the bride that is like oh my god my colors are this and this
9356050 the colors comes out of a more organic place rather than a trend it often comes from flowers used in the wedding
9356051 new york is the most expensive place to get married and for guests to travel to so you see the numbers going down in order to save money and most new yorkers dont have the luxury of being impractical with money
9356052 its a great way to save money and its perfect for smaller weddings
9356053 tonight tonight i say to the people of america to democrats and republicans and independents across this great land enough
9356054 for better or worse and its not always for better it is my natural state i cant help it
9356055 hes manipulating all his little kingdoms and empires from afar
9356056 they have to solve crimes each week that are happening due to experiments being executed by people who are using the whole world as guinea pigs
9356057 spending all that time being pumped full of drugs and having electric shock therapy has made him a little bit unstable
9356058 not to say he wasnt when he went in there
9356059 most of this fringe stuff is actually possible which makes it interesting and scary at the same time
9356060 a rogue a brilliant nomad who doesnt really know what his purpose is
9356061 hes essentially the bridge between walters techno babble and english
9356062 he serves to say ok those are the four things that make sense and then these are the 16 things that dont make sense
9356063 shes straight down the line fbi who has been exposed to this other world and is reeling from trying to comprehend it
9356064 she wrangles peter and walter in and maintains the focus of the trio
9356065 we were talking about how much we missed working on a tv show together
9356066 though that character was very different from walter bishop we thought theres a series about a guy like this
9356067 although its generally considered by both tv insiders and fans alike that most anything abrams touches turns to gold
9356068 the truth is that the fans of lost or alias are the people we are beholden to
9356069 i actually dont think of them as fans the people who are into those shows are also fans of the shows that i am interested in
9356070 we want an agreement to end the israeli occupation and establish an independent palestinian state with jerusalem as its capital
9356071 president abbas told olmert that we will not be part of an interim or shelf agreement
9356072 either we agree on all issues or no agreement at all
9356073 the most critical issue that threatens the whole peace process now
9356074 cling to their guns and religion because of their frustration over their economic situation
9356075 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
9356076 its amazing how liberals cry for freedom of speech but when self imposed censorship affects
9356077 electing john mccain would be a third term for president bush
9356078 ok so barack obama isnt a good fit to be president tell us why john mccain is a better fit
9356079 i dont regret setting bombs i feel we didnt do enough
9356080 any country that has a potential separatist movement will view the events in georgia through its own unique prism
9356081 but the greatest cause for concern lies in the ukraine azerbaijan and moldova all states that border russia
9356082 by illegally recognizing the georgian territories of abkhazia and south ossetia dmitry medvedev russias president made clear that moscows goal is to redraw the map of europe using force
9356083 we have our western friends and those in central asia who are not in agreement with russian actions but we also have a strong relationship with russia
9356084 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9356085 shes not wearing a dashiki and shes not waving a kalashnikov besides that im not even sure were at the right convention
9356086 then why do they keep talking about families parents children veterans they look way too normal where are they hiding the meth head tattooed bisexual america hating welfare cheat san franciscans who are the real base of the party
9356087 they cant fool us by pretending to look like americans now for some more fair and balanced coverage from hooters
9356088 keith did you notice how bill clinton said obama is the man for this job
9356089 indeed i did chris doesnt that imply that theres a woman whom he believes would be the best person for the job but of the men available obama is the best
9356090 its more than an implication its a subtle nod to all four pumas weve been able to interview in order to drive our narrative that this is a bitterly divided down to the last out contest with a convention that will fail to unify the party
9356091 wolf i just interviewed a westerner who said there was a dog whistle message hidden in new mexico gov bill richardsons statement that a few days again hed been with sen hillary clinton campaigning for sen obama in espa ola n m
9356092 anderson youre going to have to explain why thats significant
9356093 my informant told me that espa ola has the reputation of being kind of an armpit place and its the butt of dozens of jokes they tell out here so if hillary was willing to go to espa ola it means her support of barack is much more sincere and energetic than we had previously surmised
9356094 when the conservatives are calling obama the one are they mocking him or are they really trying to tie him to an unpopular president
9356095 fighting traffic the dawn of the motor age in the american city
9356096 we have acquired extra long twin sheets for the dorm beds
9356097 it says congratulations on the cover but that doesnt mean anything
9356098 see what happens when aliens breed with sheep no wonder they support the bill to help illegal aliens
9356099 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9356100 im well supported in terms of my ability to communicate back to the watch video as hurricane gustav gathers strength and takes aim at the gulf coast follow hurricane gustavs path on this interactive storm tracker view a gallery of photos of hurricane gustav view a satellite image of gustav president and back to washington so im comfortable that im not going to lose touch
9356101 a number of the hospitals that originally planned to shelter in place have now decided they are going to actually try to evacuate their critically ill and medical needs patients
9356102 as a consequence weve had to increase the tempo of our air flights into new orleans in order to make sure that we can accommodate the flow were going to be watching this very carefully today
9356103 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9356104 ill be glad when its over and i hope it doesnt mess up the city too bad
9356105 it has been a hard week because i knew i probably wouldnt have a new player in the team
9356106 we are still playing phil jagielka in midfield and we are still playing jack rodwell in midfield
9356107 we have put james vaughan in when really we wouldnt want him to play for another three or four weeks
9356108 i think it is our senior players who are letting us down at this present time either by not contributing or not defending as well as they should do
9356109 you dont want to go into an international break after a defeat like that but thats the way it is we may change the defence but we cant at the moment because we dont have the players
9356110 we created and we havent done that in other games
9356111 the defending was very very average and it should have been much better
9356112 leighton baines delivered some good balls and we got lots of crosses in but we didnt have the magic player who could have done something different
9356113 i thought we deserved to get a goal out of the game and we kept trying to do the right things
9356114 they changed their system and they always had the threat of peter crouch and jermain defoe on the counter attack
9356115 i didnt think we deserved to win at west brom and we didnt deserve to beat blackburn
9356116 in truth i think we played better against portsmouth than the other games but we didnt get the goals you
9356117 the bottom line is that in the last 10 or 11 years football has grown significantly in this state its booming right now
9356118 anytime you get more teams involved thats a good thing overall i think that this is good for new hampshire football
9356119 i really dont know how this is all going to work out
9356120 i know i liked playing hanover and laconia i prefer it when there are five or six teams fighting to get into the playoffs late in the season thats kind of fun
9356121 its probably going to take half the season before i know whether i like the change or not
9356122 the same with three and four and five and six you could have a north and a south and have the champion from each league play each other for the state title you could make it like a bowl game
9356123 i liked playing plymouth because you always strive to beat the best
9356124 i suppose some of this was done out of a concern for the cost of transportation but thats not something i have to worry about i just concern myself with who were going to play and whats in our division
9356125 the six divisions will give more teams a chance to make the playoffs
9356126 i also think its going to make the competition level
9356127 the best thing about all of this is that we can realign every two years
9356128 the fact that we have the number of players that we do gives us more depth
9356129 the importance of depth is something we noticed when we were in division ii and we were looking across the field at teams with 60 or 70 players back then if we got an injury we were often in bad shape
9356130 we were hoping to bring in at least 20 from newmarket so we fell short of that
9356131 i think a lot of it is fear of the unknown
9356132 some people say we would have been a playoff team in division vi but i see it differently
9356133 if you want to be a high level team you have to play high level competition we dont want to back down from competition
9356134 even though he was a freshman he was the quarterback for our jv team last season
9356135 hes got a pretty good arm hes gonna be a better passer than ryan
9356136 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9356137 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9356138 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9356139 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9356140 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9356141 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9356142 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9356143 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9356144 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9356145 but there are still a lot of vulnerabilities this could be a a much worse storm hopefully it wont be but the possibilities are definitely there
9356146 as always depth is a concern you cant avoid all injuries i think forming a co op team and staying in division v will force us to get better faster
9356147 were inexperienced in the offensive backfield but we do have six or seven guys there well need to play as a unit defensively
9356148 weve been more consistent than we were last year in doing things the right way
9356149 we have experience at qb and receiver we have better athletes across the board than we had last year time will tell whether or not that translates into victories on the field
9356150 i do think were going to be able to throw the ball we have a few kids who could fill in but were not real deep this team is on par with some of our recent teams but we have to get better
9356151 well have to be much better defensively than we were last year if were going to make the playoffs we gave up too many big plays last season and we werent as physical as we should be the offense is going to take time because were young
9356152 we think we have some kids who can play but varsity experience is our biggest question mark we have to take some strides but making the playoffs is our goal we have some kids with high expectations
9356153 if we stay healthy were capable of winning five or six games this year
9356154 the league seems to be coming down and we seem to be moving up
9356155 were loaded with skill kids especially at running back we have a lot of depth there the attitude has been tremendous but we still have some gears we havent found yet
9356156 as always depth is a concern you cant avoid all injuries i think forming a co op team and staying in division v will force us to get better faster
9356157 were inexperienced in the offensive backfield but we do have six or seven guys there well need to play as a unit defensively
9356158 weve been more consistent than we were last year in doing things the right way
9356159 we have experience at qb and receiver we have better athletes across the board than we had last year time will tell whether or not that translates into victories on the field
9356160 i do think were going to be able to throw the ball we have a few kids who could fill in but were not real deep this team is on par with some of our recent teams but we have to get better
9356161 well have to be much better defensively than we were last year if were going to make the playoffs we gave up too many big plays last season and we werent as physical as we should be the offense is going to take time because were young
9356162 we think we have some kids who can play but varsity experience is our biggest question mark we have to take some strides but making the playoffs is our goal we have some kids with high expectations
9356163 if we stay healthy were capable of winning five or six games this year
9356164 the league seems to be coming down and we seem to be moving up
9356165 were loaded with skill kids especially at running back we have a lot of depth there the attitude has been tremendous but we still have some gears we havent found yet
9356166 the adversity that came toward me this year started in spring training and never quit it just pounded me all year
9356167 it was a dream come true and my life turned 180 degrees in one night
9356168 i think sometimes when things arent working at this level teams really can make you pay
9356169 but at the same time when it turns around and it clicks it can be pretty good
9356170 i cant say i blame them if they dont bring me back up this year because i didnt do what i had to do this year
9356171 the way we view him and how we value him hasnt changed
9356172 the biggest thing for a player is to learn what their abilities are and what are their limits and to make the adjustments with the lines
9356173 for all his struggles hes had this year hes actually a better pitcher than he was last year
9356174 its a matter of believing you can succeed at that level
9356175 i just didnt believe i was going to succeed every time i went out in the big leagues its hard to go out there and succeed if you dont believe youre going to
9356176 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9356177 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9356178 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9356179 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9356180 gustav is a large system similar to katrina the difference at this moment is that its asymmetric it doesnt have a uniform coverage like katrina
9356181 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding
9356182 my message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9356183 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9356184 newcastle united can confirm that captain michael owen has been offered an extended and improved three year contract
9356185 the proposed terms of the new deal include an increased salary for michael and demonstrate the clubs commitment to keeping him
9356186 the club hopes that this enhanced contract offer will keep him at st james park
9356187 it hurts to lose on a blocked kick at the end
9356188 its a story of a group of young men that have come together and said were tired of losing
9356189 their working very hard for that on the field and im very proud of them
9356190 it hit my arm i was just looking around to see if anyone else could scoop and score
9356191 but i got a good bounce and came right to my hands i just took it
9356192 while the trip is challenging its plenty of fun as well and i can guarantee that anyone taking part will find it an incredible experience
9356193 anyone with a spirit of adventure and a moderate level of fitness can sign up so wed urge all those who want to indulge their wanderlust and help a good cause to get in touch as soon as possible
9356194 to try to erase many years of thinking about either needing to change their sound or evolve
9356195 if your marching orders for the first 20 years have been change change change then letting go of those preconceived ideas is in its own way a new idea
9356196 rick put this mantra over our heads which was dont be afraid of your past you dont have to copy it but its ok to be inspired by it
9356197 somebody would smuggle one in but you didnt know that person you asked around and somebody would give you a cassette a copy of a copy of a copy
9356198 i would say that was a different person i know more now
9356199 i figured there were three ways you could work at the dresses add something to the top or the bottom for a layered effect alter the neckline or add accessories
9356200 nothing took a sewing machine all the alterations could be done with a needle and thread or a safety pin
9356201 i used wired ribbon to add a ruffle that way you dont even have to gather the ribbon you just stitch it on and let the wire do the work as opposed to having to put a real ruffle on there this was my approach to having a layered look to adding something to the top of the dress
9356202 i changed the neckline from a scoop neck to a v neck thats literally just done with a needle and thread just sewn through and then pulled tight but you could just as easily do it with a safety pin or a brooch
9356203 to play up the glitter part of the dress i covered the gathered section with a little strip of rhinestone trim from m amp j trimming on sixth ave and 38th st
9356204 i added the belt and then it started to look so french i changed the neckline as well
9356205 its just stitched and pulled at each side of the neck to make it a square neck
9356206 the belt was just something i had lying around the idea here is what accessories do you have that would personalize the dress
9356207 i spent several years in a north vietnamese prison camp in the dark fed with scraps do you think i want to do that all over again as vice president of the u s
9356208 war is wretched beyond description and only a fool or a fraud could sentimentalize its cruel reality
9356209 ramadan comes at a time when the iraqis have earned the result of their patience and victory on terrorists criminals and outlaws
9356210 the success of our forces to enforce the law is helping in the return of thousands of iraqis to their country and homes there is progress in security and peace
9356211 our forces are ready to take the security responsibility tomorrow monday
9356212 they are controlling the situation our troops are on alert to avert any failure of the transfer
9356213 we are happy that iraqi forces will be in control now of the security rather than the foreign troops that is how it should be iraqis should protect the iraqis
9356214 our forces are not ready to take responsibility for the situation i am sorry to say but there is lot of corruption in our security forces
9356215 the change in the al anbar province is real and perceptible
9356216 none of these artists were influenced by flavin or are devotees of him what they have in common is that they are all artists who work with light natural light emanating light projected light
9356217 matthias and i were talking about how impressed we were by the last munster sculpture project and how the installations occupied the entire town
9356218 matthias thought how great it would be to do the same thing in st louis after he thought more about it he realized he would have to scale back not take on the entire city but limit the project to grand center
9356219 the pulitzer is committed to help the development of grand center
9356220 this is a piece that is at one time a monochrome painting at another time its a landscape painting of a sunset and its also a work of art thats edible
9356221 these are centuries old traditions and i will continue to defend them
9356222 only those who indulge in immoral acts should be afraid
9356223 and you know its great that its the u s open
9356224 its the one that you know if i had to pick one to win it would be this one
9356225 so right now im just hoping to win my next match
9356226 the bottom line is that in the last 10 or 11 years football has grown significantly in this state its booming right now
9356227 anytime you get more teams involved thats a good thing overall i think that this is good for new hampshire football
9356228 i really dont know how this is all going to work out
9356229 i know i liked playing hanover and laconia i prefer it when there are five or six teams fighting to get into the playoffs late in the season thats kind of fun
9356230 its probably going to take half the season before i know whether i like the change or not
9356231 the same with three and four and five and six you could have a north and a south and have the champion from each league play each other for the state title you could make it like a bowl game
9356232 i liked playing plymouth because you always strive to beat the best
9356233 i suppose some of this was done out of a concern for the cost of transportation but thats not something i have to worry about i just concern myself with who were going to play and whats in our division
9356234 the six divisions will give more teams a chance to make the playoffs
9356235 i also think its going to make the competition level
9356236 the best thing about all of this is that we can realign every two years
9356237 the fact that we have the number of players that we do gives us more depth
9356238 the importance of depth is something we noticed when we were in division ii and we were looking across the field at teams with 60 or 70 players back then if we got an injury we were often in bad shape
9356239 we were hoping to bring in at least 20 from newmarket so we fell short of that
9356240 i think a lot of it is fear of the unknown
9356241 some people say we would have been a playoff team in division vi but i see it differently
9356242 if you want to be a high level team you have to play high level competition we dont want to back down from competition
9356243 even though he was a freshman he was the quarterback for our jv team last season
9356244 hes got a pretty good arm hes gonna be a better passer than ryan
9356245 tonight americans witnessed a misleading speech that was so fundamentally at odds with the meager record of barack obama when the temple comes down the fireworks end and the words are over the facts remain senator obama still has no record of bipartisanship still opposes offshore drilling still voted to raise taxes on those making just 42 000 per year and still voted against funds for american troops in harms way the fact remains barack obama is still not ready to be president
9356246 has a vision for change for the country versus barack obamss rhetoric
9356247 how much enthusiasm can you gin up by dumping on the other guy
9356248 i know that bishop mccormack has great confidence in the physicians nurses and staff at catholic medical center
9356249 i ask that we all join in praying for a speedy recovery for the bishop and that the lord will guide those who are caring for him
9356250 if you see her say hello she might be in tangiers
9356251 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9356252 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9356253 the system itself is stronger than it was before katrina
9356254 this was just how it was in katrina we joked that we would all be back home in three days but we came back three years later
9356255 its a joke it isnt a matter of holy or unholy all months are holy if they want to end fighting it should be permanent
9356256 we want enforcement of sharia laws and will continue our struggle we havent got instructions from our top leadership to stop fighting if they do order a halt then we certainly will
9356257 ive always been interested in americanisms im asking people to take time to think about what were told is of value to us
9356258 people can get close and feel the strong wind on their faces and their hair
9356259 the american ideal of life is under a certain amount of stress from other ideas
9356260 its not what it was 20 years ago i think our self concept has changed
9356261 get focused about what really matters in a democratic society
9356262 the flag is an event not a flat piece of cloth or a lapel pin
9356263 what is animal what is human and what is civilized behavior
9356264 as they drove he was shot in the temple they threw him out of the car near the hospital
9356265 he was discovered there and they quickly put him on the operating table which is where he died
9356266 these mice were normal and we could tell which were new nerve cells and they should be functional
9356267 we believe those neurons are very important for olfactory system sense of smell
9356268 normal mice quickly learn which hole to get to where its dark and has bedding for the mutants they learn where to hide but after a week they totally forget they completely lose their memory
9356269 i dont remember how many firefights we had with the americans because there were many i dont remember how many american vehicles we blew up
9356270 i could not tolerate the occupation and so joined the islamic army
9356271 i met al qaeda militants in the camp they were fiery and fierce their anti american speeches and agendas influenced me and i joined them after i was released
9356272 when they want to do something they will do it
9356273 there was a time when not a single american truck passed this area without being attacked
9356274 our families and friends stopped supporting us they were tired of violence they started suffering
9356275 they killed those young boys for no reason that is when the locals turned against the insurgency and the sahwa mushroomed
9356276 i have not killed iraqis so i am sure i would be accepted back without any difficulty
9356277 im not a skilled labourer but i need a job maybe in the security forces as im also a target of al qaeda now
9356278 we have proposed several road projects a new hospital and a school
9356279 i was like what are you talking about because im danish india and theyd all laugh and respond thats so true
9356280 no matter your ethnicity almost everyone can laugh at the phrase in a positive way and thats very unique you cant say everybody wants to be danish people will look at you like youre an idiot
9356281 so i sat down with the intent of writing it for little italy but theres one thing that bothered me about it for this story and that was that in new york you can easily get out of the neighborhoods
9356282 for me it was actually really important that the characters dont flow in and out of this world so even though theres nothing like little italy you can still walk across the street and be in chinatown
9356283 im sort of more known in the horror genre and a lot of my extended italian family are very opinionated about some of the roles ive chosen in the past
9356284 always tanned to the color of coconut shells and easily identified by short skirts on the females armani exchange t shirts on the males
9356285 to denigrate people because of their clothing or tan is absolutely absurd especially when those people have contributed enough money in belmar to keep those businesses thriving throughout the summer every year
9356286 due to hurricane gustav president bush is unlikely to travel to minnesota for the convention
9356287 the white house is working on alternate plans and well provide more information as we have it
9356288 we felt like we had a chance to win this football game in this difficult environment
9356289 the disappointing things were 1 we couldnt run the football as we thought wed be able to run the football and 2 defensively we gave up a few too many big plays
9356290 i thought in some areas they did pretty good the tight end middleton got his first start today and i thought he did pretty good overall but weve still got to grow
9356291 theres no area we can say we feel comfortable about
9356292 im just really impressed right now with steven ayers and sophomore offensive lineman brian danaher
9356293 steve and brian played like older players and worked real hard on staying mentally composed and took the reins of their respective positions
9356294 i remember coming to these few games wsu games at qwest field when i first started pretty much every one as a fan i remember coming here watching them play colorado play baylor play grambling state i can point to the section up in the stands where i was sitting coming in at 10 a m it was almost overwhelming
9356295 i thought i played better in the second half it makes you realize i can play at this level and i can play at this level well if you want to be successful you cant be afraid of failure
9356296 the tenth of a second ago is gone the tenth of a second from now hasnt happened yet and therefore is not in our consciousness
9356297 if i cant remember anything from the moment the timer beeps until the range officer commands if you are finished unload and show clear then i have accomplished perfection in the execution
9356298 theres just no doubt whatever that jamie is our most accomplished catcher
9356299 couple that with the fact clements had a sore knee recently and that burke has the stronger throwing arm it wasnt a tough call
9356300 teams make defensive substitutions in the outfield all the time we just did it behind the plate
9356301 if i dont use burke there why is he here
9356302 we had two big injuries and were down a goal really early and we were able to battle back and equalize in the end they got us thats soccer she took her chance well
9356303 im just really impressed right now with steven ayers and sophomore offensive lineman brian danaher
9356304 steve and brian played like older players and worked real hard on staying mentally composed and took the reins of their respective positions
9356305 i remember coming to these few games wsu games at qwest field when i first started pretty much every one as a fan i remember coming here watching them play colorado play baylor play grambling state i can point to the section up in the stands where i was sitting coming in at 10 a m it was almost overwhelming
9356306 i thought i played better in the second half it makes you realize i can play at this level and i can play at this level well if you want to be successful you cant be afraid of failure
9356307 in that first year we went in thinking lets be the best that we can be
9356308 this year were heading into our third year and i expect the offense to be dominant and i think they expect that of themselves they have a lot of seniors a lot of veterans and should be ready to go
9356309 the offense will have to come out and perform and execute
9356310 but the defense is going to continue to get better thats what one of our focuses will be well be looking to improve as the season goes on as all the pieces start fitting in and gelling together
9356311 i think offensive coordinator kefense hynson knows that i have a lot better understanding of the offense this year
9356312 hes said he doesnt want to limit what we do he feels comfortable that i understand a lot better this year than i did last season
9356313 weve all been in the system another year and were so much more comfortable with everything i think the offensive staff has done a great job coaching us up on understanding the system better were 10 times further along right now than we were last year
9356314 we know we have pressure on us to come out here and perform every week but i think we kind of like that pressure were even kind of relishing in it a little bit
9356315 we have some good young players who will get better well have to be basic starting out because wed rather get beat physically than mentally if we are going to get beat but well be ok weve really limited what we put in this fall but that will change
9356316 i think ive said this since day one that were always looking for good players and good people who can come in here and help the program
9356317 when it gets to this point just before the season begins until we play somebody else were never really sure where were at were just thinking lets go out and play and see where we wind up
9356318 we had two big injuries and were down a goal really early and we were able to battle back and equalize in the end they got us thats soccer she took her chance well
9356319 this was all just a massive weed patch and scraggly plants
9356320 he wanted something that reminded him of walking in the mountains
9356321 its very much a meditative garden as well the longer youre with it the more it will reveal itself
9356322 for me as i sit here and stand here and look every rock i see something different
9356323 in different light it has a different appearance in that regard its different than all the rocks you see up in the mountains its very unique
9356324 we have colors that will come up seasonally and the ground cover will spread
9356325 in that first year we went in thinking lets be the best that we can be
9356326 this year were heading into our third year and i expect the offense to be dominant and i think they expect that of themselves they have a lot of seniors a lot of veterans and should be ready to go
9356327 the offense will have to come out and perform and execute
9356328 but the defense is going to continue to get better thats what one of our focuses will be well be looking to improve as the season goes on as all the pieces start fitting in and gelling together
9356329 i think offensive coordinator kefense hynson knows that i have a lot better understanding of the offense this year
9356330 hes said he doesnt want to limit what we do he feels comfortable that i understand a lot better this year than i did last season
9356331 weve all been in the system another year and were so much more comfortable with everything i think the offensive staff has done a great job coaching us up on understanding the system better were 10 times further along right now than we were last year
9356332 we know we have pressure on us to come out here and perform every week but i think we kind of like that pressure were even kind of relishing in it a little bit
9356333 we have some good young players who will get better well have to be basic starting out because wed rather get beat physically than mentally if we are going to get beat but well be ok weve really limited what we put in this fall but that will change
9356334 i think ive said this since day one that were always looking for good players and good people who can come in here and help the program
9356335 when it gets to this point just before the season begins until we play somebody else were never really sure where were at were just thinking lets go out and play and see where we wind up
9356336 the sea is something that is so very complicated i just thought it would be great to draw it by crayon
9356337 i think animation at times needs the pencil and needs mans drawing hand
9356338 i am 67 years old when i do my next work ill be more than 70 so i probably will have to have help from the younger generation
9356339 both starting pitchers did a great job both bullpens struggled and both teams used offense late to make a game of it
9356340 given the position of these two teams in the standings thats saying something
9356341 i threw a couple of breaking balls then came back with fastballs
9356342 the truth is this is the worst year of my career from a team point of view or a personal one
9356343 the most frustrating and the most disappointing from a team standpoint we had such high expectations and the year has been a disaster
9356344 they say the game will drive you crazy if you let it and im pretty close
9356345 in may i had the worst month of my career i was absolutely brutal and theres no other way to say it
9356346 but ive come out of seven eight games with a lead and gotten no decision this season thats hard to swallow too
9356347 its tough to beat any team with the mistakes we made today
9356348 but when you face a really solid of football team its going to be challenging
9356349 first of all the ball was kicked to the middle of the field and we wanted it on the numbers
9356350 we had two guys that werent in their lanes heck we didnt have anybody between the hashes
9356351 he may have made the biggest play of the game
9356352 they just started to get a little momentum back but when perrish returned that kickoff it really made a big difference and turned the momentum back over to our side
9356353 but i dont think were mature enough just yet to handle something like that were just not
9356354 zac expects me to make that play so i expect myself to make that play
9356355 were a pac 10 team and we need to be playing real teams
9356356 there was always a great love there as well as a bit of annoyance
9356357 its like being married you know for that long you just kind of get sick of the other person
9356358 its kind of tough being a partner when your partner does a movie without you
9356359 after that he sort of went his way and i went my way
9356360 its like turning an oil tanker around you know you dont stop on a dime and speed up 180 degrees in the other direction you kind of start doing it one gig at a time
9356361 im actually just starting to get back into making money
9356362 i would be offered marijuana by snitches and then i would be drug tested an hour or two later
9356363 when they arrested me they thought for sure that i had a lot of prior arrests and they thought i was this pothead idiot you know they thought i was my character basically
9356364 were at the age that we just dont want to argue anymore
9356365 so we decided not to have a personality conflict anymore
9356366 this will be a challenge for our team and itll be interesting to see how they respond
9356367 he was hurt and he didnt look like he was able to function with it
9356368 if the guys hurt hes not going to tell anybody hes going to try to stay in the game as long as possible
9356369 made all the right reads and all the right checks
9356370 i thought they just made a change to see what chris could do
9356371 i thought he played pretty good in the first half
9356372 i know he can play better than what he did in the second half
9356373 the searches were led by the ramsey county sheriffs office deputies coordinated searches with the minneapolis and st paul police departments todays
9356374 a heartening recognition that time in washington can be useful
9356375 v jeg havde s dan gl der mig til at synge et par salmer hertil formiddag
9356376 we gave him the challenge early on in the week that this is what were going to do were going to ride him if they were going to take away eric and he said coach just give me the ball
9356377 to be honest i really didnt i just told myself that i was going to go out there and give my best to my teammates and every time i got the ball i was going to run as hard as i could and as fast as i could
9356378 when he gets his shoulders turned he goes into a different speed
9356379 we had guys there we just didnt make plays we went into the game thinking jarod bryant was going to carry more and they would give the ball to kettani they did a good job of putting white in position
9356380 i just thought his demeanor he got a little bit nonchalant
9356381 for us to get to the next level he has to play consistent the whole game but hell do that
9356382 in the first half we let them get some drives on us and they scored a few points
9356383 in the second half we came out with a different attitude we told ourselves we were not going to let them score this half
9356384 nerve impingement in his neck that has affected his shoulder and could threaten his career i had a nasty orioles flashback
9356385 we will be showing the work of two well known gifted professional artists for the first time in our gallery dean diggins of kittery piece shown and colin berry of hampton
9356386 subject is empty are you sure you want to send the mail
9356387 if this doesnt work i think were going to be in recovery mode for a while
9356388 the convention center will restore raleigh as one of the premier meeting places in the southeast
9356389 basically it was a matter of raleigh is just not a city that can attract people for conventions
9356390 what i hope is that it wont be a white elephant
9356391 we really needed this win to get our momentum going again
9356392 it gives us a chance to get out and run
9356393 thats water under the bridge i dont even think about it
9356394 im very comfortable here with this team everybody gets so much playing time its easy to step into the lineup
9356395 crystal has been huge all year our two young rookie post players have continued to get better and better
9356396 i thank general manager john whisenant for those players hes probably the best in the league for scouting developable talent
9356397 thursdays loss in los angeles felt like the first game of the season we were really tight
9356398 sacramento came out with a sense of urgency and we didnt
9356399 we laugh and say you can watch dawn patrol at the balloon races and get a crick in your neck from looking up then come to virginia city and get the crick out of your neck while watching the camel races
9356400 it gives people a full day of something to do
9356401 the camel races have always happened in good times and bad times and even in years when we were down to just a few camels
9356402 cpi inflation is expected to be higher in the short term at around 5 per cent in the december quarter reflecting the effects of higher petrol prices and the recent correction to estimates of financial services inflation before declining thereafter
9356403 a move in november is a likelihood rather than september
9356404 theres still a fair bit of talk of elevated inflation and that suggests theyll wait for the next cpi before they move
9356405 the way this statement reads its just a little bit of hosing down how excited the market was getting for a 50 basis point rate cut
9356406 when they do start to cut its more likely to be a smaller cut rather than big cuts
9356407 we do believe that our educational efforts have made a difference
9356408 some people have said because of the economy and people losing jobs often people turn to alcohol
9356409 i hope thats not the case hopefully this will just be one of those unusual years
9356410 he would say do that until i get back then he would leave for two or three hours id be crying my eyes out
9356411 he said youve got a great feel but you dont have any technique
9356412 i sent her an e mail saying let me tell you about my dad kofi said
9356413 he never gave me a christmas present he never remembered my birthday in my whole life he gave me maybe about 5 000
9356414 i love my dad he is just a weird person to get along with
9356415 he was all over the place but his timing was still there
9356416 i could see having my top fusion musicians jamming these songs we dont just want to play parts we want to play
9356417 we dont dress up like cream we dont sound like cream we just do cream songs
9356418 im not going to tell the bass player no thats not what jack plays
9356419 the spirit of the music was lots of long jam sessions and tons of experimenting
9356420 i try to ad lib as much as i can i play some of the classic riffs just to show that i can
9356421 i have to be careful and stay out of his way and just play in the gaps
9356422 no no you dont do 16ths on the kick its too fast
9356423 and he can get things done where i dont believe obama could
9356424 not until the job is finished until the governing body in iraq says they dont want us there anymore
9356425 the issue of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
9356426 barack obama doesnt have anything in his background to suggest he understands economics either
9356427 there wasnt a doubt in my mind that we would be competitive tonight
9356428 theyre obviously a step above us but we werent afraid
9356429 and that bodes well for the rest of the season
9356430 this amazing feat will not materialized without the support from the whole firefox communities and users give yourself a big clap
9356431 its impossible to say that this system is going to do this or that
9356432 at the end of the forecast track the wind shear could let up a bit
9356433 from the perspective of sending a signal to moscow yes they want to send the hard liner out to the region
9356434 no one goes weak in the knees in the region
9356435 madonnas sticky amp sweet tour received a rapturous response from critics and fans but the 49 date trek has been getting flak from environmental groups
9356436 this is a massive amount of carbon emissions even for a top celebrity icon
9356437 however these emissions will be swamped by those caused by the crowds of concertgoers
9356438 the comparisons are outrageous unacceptable and crudely divisive all at the same time
9356439 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9356440 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9356441 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9356442 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9356443 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9356444 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9356445 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9356446 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9356447 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9356448 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9356449 man i feel about as good as i did when i was 19
9356450 im nothing but a stranger in this world i got a home on high
9356451 oh no john marks on another nostalgia trip its such a shame he used to be well he didnt used to be like this
9356452 oh oh oh oh oh sweet thing and i will raise my hand up into the night time skyyyyy and ill be satisfied not to read in between the lines and i will walk and talk in gardens all wet with rain and i will never ever ever ever grow so old again oh sweet thing sweet thing
9356453 i was too young for woodstock i didnt really start going to concerts until my youngest son was old enough
9356454 i am almost 50 years old and i certainly dont want to be condemned i dont want to be looked upon as some kind of used up dude
9356455 we created this scene we deserve to be there we belong there
9356456 i think its pretty remarkable that i get to see people that are below 9 showing up at our festival and then people in their 50s showing up at our festival and they all seem to appreciate and enjoy the music across the board
9356457 i think our partners have always pretty much stood by the fact that were a family festival
9356458 obviously lollapalooza for the last four years hasnt been like lollapalooza of the early 90s
9356459 we are a company of 25 38 as well and we know what we were going to want to go do if we were going to pay the money turns out thats who come to our festivals too
9356460 but we always keep in mind that its getting a little older and thats very interesting especially for lollapalooza
9356461 theres certainly some thought that goes into how do we make the event as broad as possible
9356462 we really wanted to have a whole stage to dedicate to that genre of music to appeal to a little bit of an older audience
9356463 in some cases theres actually three generations that are out there
9356464 ich m chte mich in bescheidener weise bei der gesellschaft f r mein verbrechen entschuldigen
9356465 i just thought that ice cream should be made here in kansas city and i got tired of never having the flavors i wanted to have
9356466 this is our name so it matters to us that people like our product
9356467 it was the way it was done in the old days our dad wanted to make sure our ice cream tasted like it did back then
9356468 its not that different from the old time method of cooking a pot of chili
9356469 if you leave it in the fridge for a week and come back it just tastes better you just have to give the flavors a chance to mingle and with patience everything blossoms
9356470 our serious concerns about these charges have been greatly elevated by the recently published article
9356471 we have grave concerns that this type of betrayal of public trust and malfeasance may be happening in our local union
9356472 they are just unhappy with him because he is in charge
9356473 pure loyalty to alejandro stephens whether hes wrong or right
9356474 listen if i could play a number of shows out there on a yearly basis id move in a heartbeat
9356475 id love to be known as the band from denver
9356476 it is such an incredible city when i was growing up i truly thought they named the broncos after me i told the other kids i had my own football team
9356477 they said you have to have one to put on the fliers
9356478 so a buddy named josh and i went back to our dorm room and thought up crummy names like groove band and happy band
9356479 then josh said to me denver youre the leader of the band you write and arrange music your names unique lets come up with something based around you what about denver amp the mile high orchestra
9356480 it was a play on my name and the city
9356481 i said thats the most ridiculous name ive ever heard in my entire life but it was the best we could come up with we got a standing ovation at the show and have been using it ever since
9356482 i think the combination of the old swing style with contemporary material is excellent
9356483 hes a great energetic performer and he has a true love for the lord
9356484 this concert was organized arranged and paid for by the lebanon ministerial association the warren county fair did not provide funds for this performance the concert was located on the infield of the racetrack and individuals had the choice to attend this concert the concert was well attended by those who chose to attend
9356485 so its a night i get to be a little bit more vocal about my faith
9356486 every time we play its my prayer and desire our music will remind people theres a god that loves them my faith in god is such i know hes going to touch the hearts of people whether we use a bunch of human words or not
9356487 so yeah theres a thematic thing running through my family names
9356488 but certain names just do not fit like tallahassee or sacramento usually ones with lots of syllables were not going to be using those names
9356489 the buck album is something that we consider a studio effort actually
9356490 even though it was material that i didnt write and all of it had been recorded before it took us several months to complete the process and i approached it with the same emotional commitment that i approach any another album with
9356491 its about survival one wants to go to a simpler quieter place in ones head and i was having dreams of carousels
9356492 i would be thinking about a carousel in a mountain meadow and it would kind of give me back my bearings
9356493 as scott says it is the carousel that just fanciful animals carved over the past 22 years by scott harrison will soon be riding the carousel of happiness in nederland photos by joe amon the denver post wouldnt die
9356494 it was in terrible shape but i was able to use quite a bit of the infrastructure including the electric motor and switch
9356495 scott would say draw me a pig its ears flapping tongue hanging out and then hed get to gluing and whittling it out
9356496 it was my honor to give him a piece of land
9356497 given that scott worked full time and had no formal training in carving that is truly remarkable
9356498 you might say this carousel is driven by compulsive behavior
9356499 theres no reason in the world why anybody would build one when there are so many other things to do
9356500 but scott has lived in the real world hes seen the worst things human beings can do the awful reality so you can see why hed want to go to the other extreme
9356501 you might say hes not right in the head but in fact hes very right in the head
9356502 he sees the innocence the joy thats not in a lot of things the carousel embodies all that
9356503 im intrigued trying to put together a machine that will transport them to a new place just an unexpected surprise
9356504 this is the real deal there is a charm unlike reproductions
9356505 and there is a cadre of people who will trip over themselves trying to get to it
9356506 this artist was very highly skilled with a paint brush
9356507 but the subject matter is absolutely surreal i have no idea what he had in mind
9356508 youve got train trestles next to boats next to a vermont snowstorm this cat had no limits everything was done humorously and capriciously
9356509 im also very proud to be a part of it scott is putting some positive juju back on the planet
9356510 we have to make sure the focus is on the south on gustav make sure that all of the resources are there and that anything that is done with regard to the convention doesnt take anything away from that and is done in a serious way
9356511 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9356512 i think that we are far far better prepared than we were the last time
9356513 we can activate an e mail list of a couple million people who want to give back
9356514 i think we can get tons of volunteers to travel down there if it becomes necessary
9356515 a big storm like this raises bipartisan concerns and i think for john to want to find out whats going on is fine
9356516 the thing that i always am concerned about in the middle of a storm is whether were drawing resources away from folks on the ground because the secret service and various security requirements sometimes it pulls police fire and other departments away from concentrating on the job
9356517 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than they have ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there is serious risk of significant flooding
9356518 the message to the people of the gulf coast is that this storm is dangerous
9356519 to climb his way out of the real problem he has with women
9356520 the battle in this election will be very much among independent swing voters
9356521 if you see her say hello she might be in tangiers
9356522 the next u s president is going to be ishmael whether we like it or not and whether he knows it or not
9356523 he said the dnc is all just political theater which is interesting because were doing a play that is also political theater
9356524 show up for annie dwyer and t j mullin at his 60th birthday celebration aug 23 john moore the denver post democracy
9356525 we had to fall in love eight times a week for 10 months in skimpy bathing suits
9356526 the next u s president is going to be ishmael whether we like it or not and whether he knows it or not
9356527 please go away for a second let me get dressed
9356528 all right lets get going well have tea and get off right away
9356529 i think the guy said he was prepared to take us for a ride
9356530 the boys went off and asked me to hide the guns now they want them back
9356531 were trying to stop the looters they steal and set fire to things weve carried out the military operation in one direction all the way to georgia weve done what we had to now its only sensible to do the same thing in the other direction on the way back otherwise thisll never stop given what the ossetians are doing in those villages there isnt a hope in hell that the others wont take revenge on them later on i see no end to this
9356532 who gave you the right youre supposed to be helping us but what are you doing
9356533 i cant let you through ive got my orders if my superiors told me to shoot at women i wouldnt do it no but otherwise ive got to follow orders
9356534 you cant be from the caucasus if this is how you treat us
9356535 i am from the caucasus but im also a soldier just doing my job
9356536 taking pictures were burning these to make sure people have to houses to come back to otherwise if they come back therell be an enclave here again and we cant live with that we answer blood with blood what is happening here is an apocalypse do you understand people are turning into animals and theres no way back
9356537 do i look like a f ing georgian open your eyes you moron im russian f it
9356538 are you a journalist take off your headscarf you look a lot like a georgian in it theyll do you in and that would be a shame
9356539 i came from vladikavkaz going home now ive had enough fighting on the day this started i just had a shower put on my fatigues and drove all the way over here with a bunch of friends there were 70 of us
9356540 i dont have any relatives here no one at all i just thought how could i not defend my own people the northerners and the southerners are one nation right but these highlanders on both sides theyre like animals the things they do to each other in the city you know how many corpses there are lying on the street have you ever seen a body thats been run over by a tank shredded to pieces without a head arms or legs when i close my eyes i can still see them
9356541 good luck safe journey home really hope you never have to fight again
9356542 whats happening in tskhinvali at the moment is there shooting a lot howll we manage
9356543 belochka has been with us all these days and as soon as shelling starts she is always the first in the cellar god wont forgive those georgians may their entire vile nation be wiped from the face of the earth
9356544 damn that saakashvili to hell we had such good lives
9356545 we thought everyone had fled a long time ago that there were only soldiers left how did you survive the bombardment dont worry we wont do anything bad to you do you think we want to kill or die if it werent for kokoity putin and saakashvili we wouldnt be here at all who needs this war
9356546 truthfully i had no idea where this was going when i started
9356547 last year i came up with a three tine hand held cultivator i showed them down at johnnys seeds and now i have orders for 800
9356548 a person who loses everything and has never been happier
9356549 i was like you gotta be kidding me hows it going to work
9356550 sometimes the door on a police car can be a barrier to communication
9356551 were finding that police are talking to more people than they ever have
9356552 he gets fuel for his car and its great for us because we are able to recycle it and put it to good use
9356553 there is a display inside that teaches kids the proper body mechanics when riding a four wheeler
9356554 there is also a ride inside for the kids thats fun but also educational
9356555 when i had a gas vehicle i had to get reimbursed for mileage
9356556 with gas prices being the way they are we couldnt do as many events as we would have liked to do
9356557 now its easier and more cost effective to bring the safety trailer to different events
9356558 if i can get the oil for free it costs only 20 cents per gallon to heat it up and filter it
9356559 once you get the oil you have to filter out all the particles before you can use it
9356560 last year we attended the seafood festival and saw all the used vegetable oil and i thought wow i can use that
9356561 its great because its someone who is local using cooking oil to fuel his car for a good cause
9356562 his pants were still there on the side of the road
9356563 you certainly could be cited for reckless operation speeding or a construction zone violation
9356564 the law is a reminder its really just safe driving practices
9356565 slowing down and moving away from the scene of a roadside incident should be common sense but not enough drivers do it
9356566 these additions to the move over law will provide protection to a larger group of emergency responders and members of the public
9356567 i think the signs have gotten a lot of attention
9356568 but something like this takes a while to catch on
9356569 i know that bishop mccormack has great confidence in the physicians nurses and staff at catholic medical center
9356570 i ask that we all join in praying for a speedy recovery for the bishop and that the lord will guide those who are caring for him
9356571 its a good location and although attendance has been down its been a good organization for the league
9356572 so there we were 14 of us in the family section and the vendor came through selling cracker jack
9356573 it was the fourth inning and suddenly the song was in my head buy me some peanuts and cracker jack and it sounded good
9356574 first of all you dont get any peanuts until you get to the bottom of the bag and you only get six of them
9356575 i was making it out to be this big thing i remember years ago the prize would be a little secret decoder ring or a toy of some kind or a baseball card i guess those days are gone
9356576 to be around adam just gave you this euphoric happy feeling
9356577 he made us all better people i think our family is an example of his impact
9356578 my closeness with adam makes me have a huge drive to make this festival go off every year without a hitch
9356579 that was a nice thing for us to feel like the community embraced us and adam
9356580 his impact was quite profound down at the high school
9356581 we started the festival in honor of adam to raise money and try to give back to the local community for people with abilities and disabilities
9356582 it means a lot to my uncle bill and erica and it means a lot to me and the rest of the family
9356583 i hope that a family can come and just relax and have some good food listen to music have some entertainment and everybody can feel like theyre having a great day
9356584 we always find ourselves in that spot i think our parents understand our costs really have remained pretty consistent
9356585 you add 20 students to the school and as long as it was spread out among the grades we wouldnt have to hire any new staff
9356586 it is truly a factor of the number of students in the school
9356587 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9356588 we will have collected data on the number of youth with disabilities participating in athletics and mainstream education we will have developed a guide for adapted pe and athletics
9356589 the world as a whole and our country included has appeared to behave as if these fossil fuels were inexhaustible
9356590 what well see shortly is that as everyone will know if you stop and think about it that oil is finite
9356591 it is a little disappointing to see the lack of interest in roscoes depth of knowledge on this issue
9356592 he tries to educate the leadership on both sides democrats and republicans unfortunately they dont listen closely enough
9356593 would require sharp reductions in oil consumption and the competition for increasingly scarce energy would drive up prices possibly to unprecedented levels causing severe economic damage while these consequences would be felt globally the united states as the largest consumer of oil and one of the nations most heavily dependent on oil for transportation may be especially vulnerable
9356594 you will never know that oil has peaked until you look back at it
9356595 this plateau in global production weve been on now for three years may in fact not be peaking it may be a little plateau there may be a pickup
9356596 the total commitment of world war ii the technology focus of putting a man on the moon and the urgency of the manhattan project
9356597 the other night i was with a group of people and the fastest thing to do was to get on the bus some of these people had never been on a bus as if this was some awful low class way
9356598 people who wouldnt normally take the bus they can see this beautiful piece of art here and want to take public transportation
9356599 we as an industry need to repaint the picture and make it attractive
9356600 do a great deal to shore up the conservative base
9356601 should appeal tremendously to all of the mothers the women
9356602 the big group that is up in the air as to who republicans can go out and get is female voters
9356603 john mccain was not my first choice but i am a lot more excited today than i was yesterday
9356604 like a lot of conservatives i was holding my breath
9356605 i can speak as one conservative woman this energizes me quite a bit
9356606 the women of america arent finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all
9356607 its going to really boost the ticket and the energy of the base wherever it was lacking because it is a first for the republicans and a good pick
9356608 weve gone out of the realm of the manly look of the republican party we have a pretty face on the republican party and not just a pretty face but a woman who is accomplished in many ways
9356609 the common theme from obama and biden is that for every problem government is the solution
9356610 the common theme is that solutions reside in american citizens
9356611 hes taken an executive who has 15 074 employees in alaska which is probably 15 000 more employees than obama and biden combined
9356612 i might even take a day and go im very proud of the party
9356613 and a funny electricity goes through your body you are holding in your hands something johann sebastian bach held in his
9356614 what philippe has accomplished would not have been possible without the digital age
9356615 i was fascinated by the story of that manuscript and put it in the recesses of my memory
9356616 i noticed that there were a few music manuscripts in the inventory so i wondered where they could be
9356617 a very short piece of information two lines mentioning that in a small museum in a city south of paris called melun there was a sheet of music given by neukomm to a certain auguste vincent
9356618 now i can affirm that the melun manuscript contains the missing pages three and four
9356619 was the privilege the pleasure and above all the responsibility of being its custodian for a while
9356620 i dont know if french law would even permit it
9356621 if i won power ball yeah maybe id negotiate for it but my father used to say 40 percent of something is better than 100 percent of nothing i have 75 percent and for the other 25 percent a digital scan of the pages is more than satisfactory to me
9356622 mccain needs to continue to make the case that he is ready to lead and barack obama is not that is the essential definition of this election
9356623 it can never be mean or angry but john mccain is now beautifully set up to continue his fundamental message which is the world is a dangerous place put somebody in charge who knows what hes doing
9356624 needs the convention to really stick it to obama because obama is still more undefined than people think and voters are showing they are nervous about him
9356625 shes not from these parts and shes not from washington
9356626 she stands up for whats right and she doesnt let anyone tell her to sit down
9356627 i think shes a mile wide and about an inch deep
9356628 but she has the alaskan touch shes a hockey mom she hunts she fishes her husband is a mans man her son joined the army these are powerful images that resonate with a lot of people
9356629 from the moment she began making her mark in politics she was criticized for being too young too inexperienced and too naive
9356630 yet time after time over the years underestimating sarah always proved to be a big mistake
9356631 speaking her own mind and then worrying about whether its popular afterward
9356632 i quickly discovered i could make life better for each and every person i was taking care of
9356633 because their problems didnt have to do with their medications their three biggest problems were loneliness helplessness and boredom once i understood that it changed my life
9356634 he is one of the most thought provoking scholars in this field and he is serving as a kind of magnet in attracting people to the erickson school and to the baltimore area
9356635 i have the ability to let my mind race with wild abandon
9356636 and i have the ability to concentrate on one thing for hours on end
9356637 because were starting a school from scratch i get to spend a lot of time developing courses developing new ideas
9356638 i glanced over he was solving differential calculus equations so theres this brilliance there but also a quirkiness
9356639 to put elders back at the center of our system
9356640 i didnt get into government to do the safe and easy thing its like the that old adage a ship in harbor is safe but thats not why the ship is built politics isnt just a game of clashing parties and competing interests the people of america expect us to seek public office and to serve for the right reason
9356641 after you meet her and know everything is done by hand with love and care
9356642 some of lifes greatest opportunities come unexpectedly and this is certainly the case for me
9356643 dulu waktu aku masih kecil pernah diajak bapak sholat tarwih di masjid bapak sampai kringetan basah kuyup menggendong aku
9356644 she used to go out all night and i pleaded with her not to go she went anyway she said she was trying to join a gang
9356645 he dealt with it in a mature fashion hes looking toward the future and not dwelling on it it has made him a better person in the end and he is just looking forward to week 2 and getting back to the seahawks
9356646 with the two suspended players that gives us 52 players on the current roster
9356647 we will add another player before the opener against the bengals
9356648 yeah youre disappointed im just rolling with the punches and hopefully something develops
9356649 if they say we cant guarantee your safety you dont go
9356650 these subjects are part of a longer and midterm discussion
9356651 we found ourselves in an awkward situation when a country militarily invading and occupying our country then recognizing part of its territories is trying to create a sense of normalcy
9356652 israel missed a chance to learn from the most influential musicians of the decade and the beatles missed an opportunity to reach out to one of the most passionate audiences in the world
9356653 sleep is good for human beings we perform poorly if we are deprived of it
9356654 if we can look at animals and see what purpose sleep is serving we can formulate help or treatments for people with insomnia
9356655 stri is an ideal location to study them because it offers all the necessary conditions its comfortable has the necessary facilities and i can work with other global authorities
9356656 we got a chance to put our names on the map
9356657 that was a time when there were lots of backpackers all over asia
9356658 made a very conscious decision that they didnt want low end tourism they only wanted high end tourism
9356659 our tourism policy is driven by a policy of high quality low volume
9356660 if we feel that there are too many tourists coming in we may increase the pricing policy
9356661 you know its not costing 4 000 to put us in tents and monasteries and give us yak tea
9356662 the cost of playing football is going through things like this where your livelihood is on the line
9356663 his longevity comes from the fact he values it so much
9356664 its his craft not many guys can do it as well as he does it hes in an elite category
9356665 this team has appreciated gary stills the last two years
9356666 if they appreciate gary stills another year great if they dont im still fine i appreciate them giving me the opportunity to come play in this program
9356667 but i dont want to think about that im ready to play football next week for the baltimore ravens
9356668 it was an awesome experience when i got that call at about 5 30 p
9356669 i just got out there and got into the flow a little bit it felt good to be out there i cant wait for next week
9356670 its been real slow going trying to get people to uproot their lives
9356671 that being said i think the project has still been tremendous these are the best freedom activists in the word that are coming here the moving aspect is a good screening process
9356672 the free state project appealed to us because it represented a real opportunity to work together with a high concentration of people who really valued freedom something that simply doesnt exist in california
9356673 they are forced to show their hand to show that they are the violent organization of men and women they really are or ignore us and hope we go away
9356674 if they ignore us we win if they arrest us we win
9356675 im really encouraged by the fact that at least were communicating and sharing ideas behind the scenes
9356676 i know that bishop mccormack has great confidence in the physicians nurses and staff at catholic medical center
9356677 i ask that we all join in praying for a speedy recovery for the bishop and that the lord will guide those who are caring for him
9356678 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9356679 it looks like theyre incredibly well prepared much better than they had before
9356680 any maryland farmer who wants to be eligible for disaster assistance on 2009 crops must have insurance coverage on all insurable fall seeded crops before the sales closing deadline
9356681 i urge farmers to talk with their crop insurance agents before the sept 30 deadline for coverage on small grains and forage
9356682 hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest hardest glass ceiling in america
9356683 exactly who i need to fight the same old washington politics of me first and country second
9356684 is one of the most significant and telling decisions a presidential candidate can make why when the country is fighting two wars facing an uncertain economy and an energy crisis did senator mccain make the choice that he did
9356685 the two words being heard the most around here this morning are dan quayle
9356686 we will be able to pretty much lock down this city
9356687 people should be confident we will be able to handle this very very well we cant promise nothing will happen but it certainly will be a tremendous force of law enforcement and military here
9356688 nobody had to tell me twice to get out this time
9356689 we had to get rescued from our roof after katrina i wasnt about to go through anything like that again
9356690 katrina was some hard earned experience now were putting that experience to work
9356691 its not the wind or the water im worried about
9356692 the police couldnt protect anybody the last time and i have no confidence things will be any different now
9356693 tem por h bito conquistar as tabelas de vendas a cada disco e simultaneamente reconquistar o carinho do p blico portugu s
9356694 i quickly discovered i could make life better for each and every person i was taking care of
9356695 because their problems didnt have to do with their medications their three biggest problems were loneliness helplessness and boredom once i understood that it changed my life
9356696 he is one of the most thought provoking scholars in this field and he is serving as a kind of magnet in attracting people to the erickson school and to the baltimore area
9356697 i have the ability to let my mind race with wild abandon
9356698 and i have the ability to concentrate on one thing for hours on end
9356699 because were starting a school from scratch i get to spend a lot of time developing courses developing new ideas
9356700 i glanced over he was solving differential calculus equations so theres this brilliance there but also a quirkiness
9356701 to put elders back at the center of our system
9356702 but this is going to be completely different from anything ive done before
9356703 the thing im looking forward to most is just going to everest seeing everest it will be amazing
9356704 russia does not want confrontation with any country russia does not plan to isolate itself russia will develop as far as possible its relations with europe with the united states of america and with other countries
9356705 everyone should understand that if someone launches an aggressive sortie he will receive a response
9356706 thank god they didnt bomb the museum but there was no guarantee we said lets preserve these things for future generations these personal things cant be replaced
9356707 if the infantry are out on the ground then the dogs and handlers are out there in front of them making sure its okay to go ahead theyre basically saving lives
9356708 i took the orders because it would be a once in a lifetime opportunity to be on the boat named after my state
9356709 it was one of my goals it was important to me to represent new hampshire
9356710 i take every opportunity i can to come up there
9356711 so i have a pretty good understanding of how things work
9356712 so your responsibility is greater you have to have a pretty full knowledge of the sub
9356713 its hard on the family for me to go out to sea
9356714 its difficult for her she knows the drill and she accepts it but its not easy
9356715 everything talks to each other and theres always a backup if one individual thing fails it doesnt limit us theres a lot of redundancy
9356716 you have to have an idea of whats going on everywhere so you know who to talk to to get the job fixed
9356717 because being on the new hampshire and from new hampshire is pretty cool
9356718 the commissioning looks like its going to be pretty exciting im looking forward to coming up there and spending some time at home
9356719 from the time the submarine was a little bit of scaffolding to what it is now
9356720 we have interfaced directly with the trades at electric boat to test the systems as they were completed meanwhile were getting training and studying the books thats why i put in the request i want to learn all i can about her
9356721 it took a while for jessica to get used to it
9356722 going away for months at a time with limited communication and i know its hard on her and my mom too she worries about me but shes my mom thats her job
9356723 it had always been a contingency of mine i had a good feeling that i could learn skills that would help me later on
9356724 weve been certified paperless so we dont have to navigate on paper the computers do everything for you
9356725 any country that has a potential separatist movement will view the events in georgia through its own unique prism
9356726 but the greatest cause for concern lies in the ukraine azerbaijan and moldova all states that border russia
9356727 they think every tamil speaking person is a terrorist they want to control us
9356728 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9356729 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9356730 in this historic political year we will be bringing our unique independent perspective and analysis to the convention
9356731 our goal is to bring both conservative and alternative news perspective to our audience of more than 5 million readers through newsmax com our email news alerts magazine and through several online newsletters
9356732 my mom who really idolized my dad had the effect on us of kind of idolizing him
9356733 i not only idolized him but i also understood that he had flaws like all of us
9356734 john mccain is an eager cold eyed politician who has sought the white house for a decade compromised and reversed himself and believes he is an actor in a grand unfolding saga he is also more comfortable with shades of gray than he appears a sense of nuance rooted it seems in an early life in which he at once revered his father and felt sorry for him
9356735 american consumers and businesses seemed to regard globalization and free trade as net positives
9356736 but in this decade rampant growth in emerging markets has mercilessly boosted prices for energy and commodities competition from foreign workers has tamped down wage growth and the weak dollar has made u s companies vulnerable to foreign buyers as a result americans are now more inclined to see themselves as victims of globalization rather than as beneficiaries of it a los angeles times bloomberg poll this spring found that 50 percent of respondents said free trade hurt the economy while only 26 percent said it helped
9356737 blocked by russia the u n security council has not been able to lift its supervisory political framework put in place after the nato intervention the international proconsul lamberto zannier the u n secretary generals special representative remains in kosovo though his duties have become increasingly unclear but hes still needed since belgrade refuses to talk directly to the kosovo government
9356738 actions that fall between armed conflict and economic sanctions could over time inspire many russians to question the kremlins cold war mind set and pressure it to move in more progressive directions
9356739 moscow is likely to see nato as a paper tiger unable either to provide real support to its partners or to respond to conflict in the wider euro atlantic area
9356740 russia has scared its neighboring states witless driving them firmly into the arms of the west the united states and europe are now in greater strategic agreement than at any point in the last two decades even the autocracies in the caucasus have reacted negatively to the attack refusing to endorse russias actions and legitimize the new facts on the ground china has refused its support and what did russia get for all this 70 000 south ossetians
9356741 she used to go out all night and i pleaded with her not to go she went anyway she said she was trying to join a gang
9356742 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9356743 our studies show that with only three out of every 10 people of military age being capable of joining the army we are going to have to do something different
9356744 its a tough structured day some of them have sat on the couch for 18 years but i havent heard any howling yet
9356745 by and large they are champing at the bit they are ready to go
9356746 theres no jobs out there nothing its just horrible and it got hard just trying to support myself and go to school at the same time
9356747 the teachers here are helping a lot my best class is english the hardest is probably the math
9356748 we have two missions get the ged and prepare them physically and mentally for basic training
9356749 these kids may have quit at some point but the big thing is a lot of people have quit on them
9356750 i now bike about 125 miles a week and run about 40 miles a week
9356751 he would stay behind me and tell me when i needed to brake did you know you do that with your hand
9356752 rhea just looked so elegant like this floating statue gliding down the street the only thing moving were her legs
9356753 if you dont have a transmission system to get it there it becomes useless
9356754 long distance transmission is only economic if it is built to high capacity which means that there must be a large amount of generation capacity in one place
9356755 its not something we are proud of that happened but its a fact
9356756 it has become a mystery that enthralls people and to that extent id love to see businesses here take advantage of that
9356757 about 600 000 tourists come to salem looking for the dark side of history
9356758 the majority of the people that are walking past our door have no idea even what state the borden murders took place much less what city
9356759 by us explaining to them the place that the murders happened is only 80 miles south of here its going to drive traffic to fall river
9356760 were confident he will do a great job going forward
9356761 a lot of people in the national press are saying oh whats happening in baltimore is a new thing but its not new at all
9356762 keep in mind weve been doing this for 20 years
9356763 it occurred to me that the history of baltimore music doesnt pass down in a way that it might in other places
9356764 this is a subject im really quite involved in and i was happy to present to people and excited for people to react to it was a really good subject to inspire some music
9356765 if id only had posters of bands from the past five years it would have made people angry and it would have been misrepresenting baltimore music
9356766 it was like a good mix tape it would be a mix cd or an ipod shuffle now
9356767 if we did anything special we kept interesting people coming to baltimore
9356768 some of the bands that are playing now were affected by seeing some of the more interesting acts coming through
9356769 i think what we have been seeing on tv is very similar to what took place on radio during the depression in that both are about reassurance
9356770 just as hearing roosevelts words reassured americans that things were going to get better so does seeing the feel good aspect of the olympics seems easy to understand its all about
9356771 let us keep the promise that american promise and in the words of scripture hold firmly without wavering to the hope that we confess
9356772 there is such ebullience from the audience in those closed arenas that its contagious this goes for republicans and democrats
9356773 the former mayor of a town of 9 000 with zero foreign policy experience
9356774 her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics
9356775 while we obviously have differences over how best to lead this country forward governor palin is an admirable person and will add a compelling new voice to this campaign
9356776 she seems like a compelling person obviously a terrific story personal story and im sure that she will help make the case for the republicans unfortunately the case is more of the same
9356777 is one more indicator of this country moving forward the fact that youve got a woman
9356778 vice presidential nominee of one of the major parties i think is one more hit against that glass ceiling
9356779 i think you know campaigns start getting these hair triggers and the statement that joe and i put out reflects our sentiments
9356780 he also wished her good luck but not too much luck
9356781 we dont know why we have to suffer economically for this process to work
9356782 weve been getting a lot of questions about this from people in the industry from south florida in general
9356783 thats going to touch every person in those small communities
9356784 even if you dont lose a job directly theyre going to feel it at the gas stations retail stores all those businesses benefit from having a large company like that in town
9356785 there has to be some common ground that we can find
9356786 this region grows the entire winter crop for the country
9356787 this probably is not going to significantly change the market for sugars and sweeteners in the united states even though u s sugar represents 10 percent of production in the u s that loss will be made up
9356788 i think that might be a bit of an exaggeration there he had hurricane katrina and right now this is no hurricane katrina
9356789 but we still think it will be a large and powerful hurricane and a significant threat the winds are between 135 miles per hour and 155 miles per hour and its a very significant hurricane
9356790 in the last 24 hours weve seen tremendous success of people leaving the area much earlier than they did three years ago
9356791 n s precisamos de outro upgrade de nossos conceitos sobre os mecanismos de evolu o
9356792 i was always fascinated by toys and i just never outgrew it

9356807 how could we have allowed that child abuse to happen
9356808 i dont know why some people have children at all if they know that they can only take a few weeks off work
9356809 its just awful its awful for the mothers as well its completely heartbreaking
9356810 you actually have to say to yourself if i have to work this hard and if im never going to see my kid and if they are going to have a tremendous stress in childcare should i be doing it
9356811 shes right large amounts of research are coming in showing that particularly for children under two but also under three childcare is generally likely to be harmful to them
9356812 childcare is not a good place for babies and we support her in that but we know that many families have elected to put very young children and infants into childcare because of serious economic pressures and we need to face up to that

9356854 we used to cut down many trees for agricultural use which brought us a lot of hardship including windstorms decreased rainfall and increased solar intensity
9356855 the amount of rainfall has dramatically increased in the last five years and heat from the sun has reduced and we now have better yield
9356856 we were doing everything by ourselves but we realised that we were not achieving much and we now involve local communities around the forests without whose help we would fail in our conservation efforts
9356857 the government now devolves more power to the forest communities in conserving the forests and shares the revenues coming from the forests and the results are quite remarkable

9356896 the tatas pulling out of west bengal would be unfortunate for india nano is seen as a world car and has drawn international acclaim immediate political dialogue to find a solution towards keeping the project in west bengal is imperative
9356897 if the house of tatas known for its values and care for the society can face such resistance the much needed fresh wave of industrialization in the country could suffer
9356898 what does the vice president do because i am a busy person
9356899 i was granted interim custody purely on the strength of her voice
9356900 i guess there is an umbilical cord between him and me he feels more secure with me
9356901 the funding and logistics of the therapies made us rethink and she came to me when she was about nine months
9356902 unless there are grounds like acute psychological disorder financial instability or a case of desertion
9356903 ultimately the courts need to go into the childs psyche to make the best possible decision for him
9356904 perhaps they felt a greater sense of security with me
9356905 the man woman relation the role division the sharing of responsibilities in a family is anyhow changing
9356906 we see men getting involved in household chores cooking participating in kids studies even men working out of home while the wife travels frequently
9356907 who says a woman can love a child more and rear him or her better than a man
9356908 then artitra said the two of us would pull it together
9356909 to expect support from them on a day to day basis is impossible
9356910 you have to make the best of any situation you learn to swim if thrown into the water
9356911 you do your best you cant keep saying i wish it hadnt happened to me
9356912 you cant keep saying i wish it hadnt happened to me
9356913 you have to take responsibility and make the best of it
9356914 you cant neglect either but winning at your job has to take a backseat
9356915 she couldnt be left at home shed sit in my lap as id drive to office there was a small space in the office where shed sleep while i was working
9356916 you have to be the father the mother as well as the breadwinner its like sita being made to go through the agni pareeksha
9356917 if i didnt get a call from my son every half hour id be shitting bricks
9356918 it wasnt until his son was older and more independent that he sent him to boarding school
9356919 the relatives and neighbours might end up pitying the child and such sympathy can be counter productive they can be prying and can scare and alarm you with their advice and observations rather than be supportive
9356920 you have to forget yourself forget the past ignore the future and live in the present
9356921 which woman would consider marrying a single father with a special child
9356922 i did not like that situation and did not want to inflict it on my daughters
9356923 it would have hurt rather than helped him in any way
9356924 children cannot fulfil your need for companionship that vacuum remains
9356925 you need to give children a lot of time understand them be patient and make it as close to a regular family as possible
9356926 im very close to my kids and have been involved in every detail of their upbringing
9356927 i share everything with my kids theres no alternative to talking you have to explain things to them make them understand the decisions you are taking consult them even on small matters like buying things for the house making them a part of the decision making process
9356928 i discuss everything with my son his friends his girlfriends everything
9356929 it is important to be a friend and advisor along with being a father
9356930 whenever she has to raise an issue with me or doesnt agree with me she writes a note to me addressed to her papa friend
9356931 women are more strict about kids studies and keep a better eye on them
9356932 its difficult to explain biological details but there is peer group these days and i also got the doctor to help her out
9356933 even mothers find it awkward to broach such topics with their daughters so its not just single fathers who need to overcome these inhibitions
9356934 they refuse to wear bindi to school they want to wear skirts all the time everything i say is taken negatively
9356935 my daughter should get 60 per cent of the credit for things to have worked out the way they have of course a normal family situation is what any child would want but such extraordinary circumstances have their own ways of creating a deep bonding
9356936 going through my daughters therapy with her has helped us become even closer
9356937 she knows i care more for her than anyone else and she cares as much for me

9356959 i have just returned from the inaugural 25k open water nationals held at the morse reservoir outside of indianapolis this past saturday it was an absolutely superbly organized and unforgettable event the race director dick sidner went to extremes to make sure that every detail of the experience was just perfect and he was ably assisted by members of his family english channel swimmer and author marcia cleveland and others the event was held on a well protected part of a very scenic reservoir lake every swimmer who did not come with a kayaker was provided with one or more
9356960 the 5 x 5k loop was measured with the finest of precision when a fellow swimmer and i arrived a couple of days early dick invited us to his home and took us for a tour of the course in his pontoon boat for the entire four days we were in town dick his wife lisa his mother in law and the other organizers treated us like family the race was very safe the field was incredibly strong the kayakers did a great job when i finished the race i hugged marcia cleveland i hugged my kayaker chris who provided me with so much encouragement and i wanted to hug everyone else who made this event so memorable thanks to all of you

9356983 the first wine we ever shared together was andre cold duck
9356984 we all started somewhere one of the chapters in our book is dont be embarrassed about the blue nun in your past because we all started somewhere
9356985 one reason the columns been so popular is we dont really write a wine column
9356986 we write a column about life its sort of a lifestyle column we write about love and romance and raising kids
9356987 i mean think about it for a second if you went outside and stopped the very first person and said tell me about the greatest wine you ever had virtually nobody would say oh yes it was the 1959 latour because it had hints of brambles
9356988 the greatest wine experiences people have dont have so much to do with whats in the bottle but whats happening at the time
9356989 our autobiography love by the glass is the story of our lives as told through wine
9356990 to some extent our new book the wall street journal guide to wine is a story of wine as told through our lives because we fundamentally just dont believe that you can separate the two wine and the experience youre having when you cap the wine are inextricably bound
9356991 well we have yuk good very good excellent and then if its at the top of the scale we have excellent with an exclamation point
9356992 but its an awful lot of fun we decide what were gonna taste and well go out and well go out and buy if we can 50 at least 50 bottles of that type we taste six to eight per night taste not guzzle
9356993 we do want to get some sense of kind of the finish and how it goes down and how smooth or not smooth it is and what kind of taste you have afterward
9356994 but when you get six or eight bottles in front of you its scary its really scary so were very very careful about how much actually goes down the hatch
9356995 our definition of a good wine is a wine that tastes good to you
9356996 if you try it and like it you might wanna know more about it but you dont have to have a ph d in it you know like you can enjoy a sunset without understanding why the sky does that just enjoy it because you like the way it tastes the people are really uptight about it thats something we hammer away at because people are intimidated from drinking wine to buying the right glass
9356997 now before we go to bed tonight john will walk into the kitchen and hell pour all these down the drain
9356998 its important to do that because when we write the columns and people say you couldnt have had the 87 and we say well heres the label we make a copy and send it to them people are very particular about their information about wine
9356999 dont wait for a birthday or anniversary its a natural thing that people should enjoy every day

9357003 your one stop information destination for couples who run their own companies and for those couples who want to start them
9357004 se est viendo ya y se va a seguir viendo
9357005 el arrinconamiento al sector privado est planteado y eso se expresa en la potestad del indepabis para la fiscalizaci n
9357006 en la ma ana de hoy hemos podido constatar que la corte primera de lo contencioso administrativo est cerrada y lleva m s de ocho meses cerrada y no hay motivo para que no pueda cumplirse esta sentencia de la corte interamericana de ddhh nuestro deseo es administrar justicia hacer justicia de manera aut noma e independiente
9357007 cuando uno revisa el comunicado del tsj es como cuando uno le pregunta a una mujer que si est embarazada y ella responde que si pero no mucho indudablemente este tribunal ha sido condenado por la cidh al expresar que este tribunal no actu en el pasado ni en el presente ni ser as en el futuro de forma independiente y de manera imparcial
9357008 conoci de todos nuestros recursos judiciales una vez que fuimos arbitrariamente destituidos
9357009 habr ya otros casos que sumados al nuestro puedan hacer concluir a todos los jueces de la corte interamericana que en venezuela la independencia judicial est seriamente amenazada

9357011 el tipo de relaci n que existe entre estados unidos y venezuela no va a ser parte de este juicio
9357012 luckily we cant get enough of each other because running a business is a full on massive amount of work and we spend almost every hour of the day and night together as a result in our personal life and professionally im the right foot hes the left and we share the same vision of where were heading
9357013 its that whole walk away from civvy street from the nine to five commuting thing
9357014 with the internet its feasible to run a start up from your front room which may explain why most are now initiated by women aged 35 plus
9357015 im strong technically and a good teacher naomi has commercial savvy and is great at sales you have to know what your strengths are and have clearly defined separate roles
9357016 you may call it push being daring what it boils down to is passion
9357017 running your own business is all consuming both partners need to be driven by the same goal
9357018 your relationship has to be watertight or the pressure of running your own business will destroy it we live eat breathe what we do 24 7 our work is our passion and we cant and dont want to separate it from who we are as a couple
9357019 weve invested so much money as well as blood sweat and tears that weve had to have that conversation
9357020 i dont advertise the fact that my co founder is my husband because its not professional to flag it up unless its relevant
9357021 we know that co directors could be wary of husband and wife teams bringing their strops and sulks into work
9357022 and its not fair for the couple to make decisions in a cliquey way
9357023 ive known husbands and wives deciding staff issues behind closed doors when theyre at home together which isnt business like
9357024 be official about it get the lawyers in always keep your commercial and emotional concerns separate

9357033 an examination of organizational communication as a moderator of the relationship between job performance and job satisfaction
9357034 went through some things im not sure i could go through
9357035 archaiczna struktura wiatowego kapitalizmu wyra a si w dw ch faktach wiatowy kryzys przemys owy z jednej strony wojny z drugiej wojna w spo ecze stwie kapitalistycznym jest tylko jedn z metod kapitalistycznej konkurencji gdy rozci gni ta jest do sfery wiatowej ekonomii
9357036 l faut viter le fl chage des cr dits et augmenter la d concentration de la gestion notamment en mati re de personnel
9357037 is there a difference between a chart i got online and a consultation with an
9357038 i have been in this void and nothing seems to be changing
9357039 its a challenge thats been floating around in adventure circles for a while now
9357040 i spent three days without food or water and a day without oxygen above 20 000 feet
9357041 we expect the water to be up to 67 degrees this week at that level hypothermia is still a major concern
9357042 i realized after that that my body was predisposed for climbing at higher elevations
9357043 after everest i wanted to try something that would be as great a challenge and i decided on the english channel
9357044 the reason its difficult is because of the bodys physiology
9357045 there is some cross over in physiological and psychological makeup
9357046 anybody that is able to climb mt everest or do anything that is highly physically demanding over a long period of time it takes incredible cardiovascular fitness and i would say the same about swimming the english channel
9357047 you cant underestimate the need for incredible cardiovascular fitness to pull off either of those events let alone both
9357048 ce soir je dis au peuple am ricain cela suffit
9357049 le bilan est clair mccain a vot dans 90 des cas avec george w bush
9357050 aujourdhui nous importons trois fois plus de p trole que lorsque le s nateur mccain a t lu la premi re fois
9357051 le vrai changement ne vient pas de washington il va washington
9357052 et en marchant nous devons faire le serment que nous iront toujours de lavant nous ne pouvons rebrousser chemin
9357053 the governor has to make tough decisions its not easy to be governor but thats his responsibility were in an economic downturn in illinois and the governments grown too much
9357054 in south carolina we are all too familiar with the grave dangers of powerful hurricanes as we gather to nominate john mccain to be the next president and anticipation for the kickoff of this historic convention grows we are closely monitoring hurricane gustav and first and foremost keeping our thoughts and prayers focused on families and communities along the gulf coast
9357055 pray for the dead fight like hell for the living
9357056 i thought a lot about what barrack and joe had to say about experience and i decided they are right it doesnt matter as long as one has intelligence and good judgement so thats why i picked sarah palin
9357057 i thought a lot about what senator mccain had to say about experience and i decided hes right it does matter a candidate needs more than just intelligence and good judgement so that is why i oppose his choice of sarah palin as vp
9357058 the more democrats call attention to inexperience at the bottom of the gop ticket the more voters will find themselves thinking about the inexperience at the top of the dem ticket
9357059 the more the word experience is repeated no matter what the context the more it will hurt obama
9357060 one should do one s duty and try to bring continuity and longevity in our long term policies and current issues
9357061 in racial division they are not interested they are sort of bored with it
9357062 the most open discussion of race since the civil rights movement in many ways that is a wonderful moment
9357063 are sometimes reluctant to see what they worked for come to fruition which is a nonracist society because they really want that to happen but it is very difficult to give up on
9357064 it opens your eyes to the concept that black talent is much wider and much more expansive than you thought it was
9357065 everything has changed now and it has become much more complex at that time i touched a very raw nerve as the memory of the 60s was much closer
9357066 it is like othello everybody focuses on the fact that othello is black it is the least important thing about him
9357067 who wants to talk about issues when you can talk about oh hes black
9357068 it would do a great deal for americas image of itself and i dont mean young black boys and girls who can say with a loud resounding voice i can i can
9357069 every person can say this truly is a place that if you work hard enough and if you have the right skill set then you can do anything you want to do that is what america always stood for
9357070 the cbcf applauds reg weavers long standing commitment to improving the u s education system
9357071 he has been a passionate advocate for quality education and for providing solutions to problems that plague inner city and other schools that serve the poor and minorities
9357072 my generation is forever indebted to trailblazers like augustus gus hawkins
9357073 where barriers existed he tore them down when history was made he was at the forefront similarly reg weaver has earned his place in history as a critical voice on public education in this country and abroad during his six year tenure at the national education association
9357074 reg weaver led a groundbreaking organizational transformation effort designed to improve the quality of public schools
9357075 i am honored to present reg weaver with the inaugural augustus gus hawkins excellence in education award for his hard work in helping students reach the excellence of their human potential
9357076 thanks to reg weavers leadership learning is taking on a new meaning
9357077 reg understands the power of the internet to bring vast educational resources to teachers parents and kids thats why hes such a strong supporter of verizons signature program thinkfinity org
9357078 i am delighted that we are joining with the congressional black caucus foundation to honor reg for his commitment to bringing innovative technologies into the classroom
9357079 a lot of people have been waiting for this for some time thats why i am excited to come
9357080 i wanted my friend to experience all these great things too
9357081 im excited to be here with all these people talking that are famous
9357082 i am more interested in what he would do as president and if he is a nice person
9357083 my previous research showed that there was just this cynicism that white people dont care the system is white so i dont care about them or it and i dont care about participating in this democratic process
9357084 a lot of it is that they didnt see themselves being represented
9357085 obama is the kind of guy they can imagine in the community at their church or even at a barbeque there is a connection kids feel from that and its a major difference
9357086 if i had known politics was like this we would have gotten involved a long time ago
9357087 this has run the emotional gamut we were never as inspired as a family until now
9357088 once she reads this in the history books she can say i was there its the same as for me in the 60s
9357089 i shook robert f kennedys hand when i was in the fifth grade at independence hall that left an impression on me for a lifetime
9357090 we had a woman running and they are going to be women but i am a black woman and they are black girls
9357091 so this is a great thing for my girls to see that they can say i can do that i can work hard and be honest and achieve that is a great thing
9357092 there are some things you cant experience on the computer or on the internet
9357093 she watched the presidential primary play itself out this is an historic moment and it will affect our lives for a long time to come
9357094 we didnt want these students to be in a situation where they reach the place veca intends but then have too worry about finances
9357095 this is a commitment with a plan to ensure they have what it takes to reach their ultimate goals
9357096 we have young people who are starting to get diabetes and having heart attacks and strokes at early ages
9357097 you do not have to donate a certain amount just designate to the initiative
9357098 this work is also dear to my heart i graciously take it on it has grown tremendously
9357099 took a picture he told me he signed an autograph that said dream big dreams and then he signed barack obama and he basically told me i could be anything that i want to be
9357100 well i think its more important what it does to his because what it says to him is that everything is possible
9357101 because if he can do it i can do it
9357102 if he is on tv they say momma momma barack obama is on tv and the whole house shuts down and we all gather
9357103 our parents had martin luther king someone they can get excited about and this is our iconic hero
9357104 hes our generation someone to get excited about someone who inspires change
9357105 so as you see it on some levels barack obamas story is your story
9357106 it help to see that its okay to be the best
9357107 as black males we can look at that and say you know what we can strive for excellence
9357108 now we see a brighter future through somebody else who you know didnt come from a lot of affluence
9357109 so theres lot of people who can look up to that and say that i dont have to sit at home and play xbox all day
9357110 so is it fair to say obama helped make it cool to be smart
9357111 i have never seen my parents this excited about anything politically
9357112 my grandfather he is over 80 years old and from his times i know that hes just astonished at the fact that there is an african american running for president
9357113 what really sticks out in my mind is the yes we can thing its just so powerful to me
9357114 because it says that you can do it no matter what the odds are against you you can do it
9357115 any historically black college or university that was established prior to 1964 whose principal mission was and is the education of black americans and that is accredited by a nationally recognized accrediting agency
9357116 i need to see if i can make it on my own

9357335 yo simplemente he transmitido mis sensaciones en cada carrera y ltimamente no eran buenas
9357336 ha tomado la decisi n de cambiar porque se ha visto en la necesidad de hacerlo
9357337 creo que el cambio puede ser correcto no creo que sea una mala decisi n
9357338 si no tienes confianza pierdes mucho un piloto sin confianza nunca puede ganar pero estoy muy agradecido a michelin han sido tres a os de trabajo en com n y he aprendido mucho de este periodo

9357340 ha llegado ahora como pod a haber llegado a final de temporada
9357341 eso no me preocupa es algo parecido a lo que le pudo pasar a rossi cuando pas a bridgestone y ahora va l der adem s a lo largo de mi carrera ya me han dado palos no me importa demasiado
9357342 ahora no estoy nada contento con michelin no estaba pilotando bien y no he conseguido exprimirme lo que tenga que venir ya se ver el futuro no lo conoce nadie
9357343 carrera muy dura porque en ning n momento he podido ir todo lo r pido que quer a
9357344 no puedo estar satisfecho porque he sido cuarto pero despu s de los entrenamientos tan complicados que hemos tenido no est tan mal eso s para mis expectativas no es suficiente
9357345 ha sido perfecto me he sentido muy bien encima de la moto y he tenido claro en todo momento que la victoria era posible este resultado es muy bueno para el campeonato pero no hay que olvidar que bou no est obligado a ganar las dos pruebas que quedan para vencer el campeonato habr que ver pero yo siempre ir a ganar
9357346 al final lo he conseguido y he sumado dos puntos m s que a estas alturas del campeonato tienen mucho valor

9357358 of course we would have prefered to have won the title under different circumstances
9357359 but with seven consecutive victories already this season we certainly feel we have earned the title

9357361 i am really proud of this team and how it competed
9357362 it was a great win for our team im happy for our team but we got to learn how to play with consistency
9357363 i dont think weve been beat that bad physically probably in three years
9357364 maybe we can cover that no 88 by next week sometime
9357365 we told ourselves that nobody is going to be more physical than us nobody is going to beat us off the ball nobody is going to touch our quarterback thats pretty much what we accomplished tonight
9357366 that maybe we would melt down on the past maybe something bad would happen people would flatten out when you respond to adversity like we did tonight thats the sign of being a good competitor
9357367 i would say our team played well for an opening game

9357486 were excited about this and were actively moving forward toward clinical trials
9357487 thats just an example of the power of these microfluidics automation technologies that one or two people working together can actually screen very large numbers of compounds
9357488 big pharmaceutical companies have very large teams and a lot of infrastructure were trying to reinvent the whole process
9357489 clemizole does have the potential to be part of a cure because the idea is not to use it on its own but as a cocktail component
9357490 neither jeffs group nor mine could have done this on our own
9357491 it was enabled by both of us bringing our pieces to the table the questions he was asking and the technology we developed
9357492 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain
9357493 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9357494 leptin tells the brain that times are good your body is full and that it is not necessary to eat more at the moment
9357495 controlling appetite and reproduction together provides a big evolutionary advantage
9357496 if there is no food the brain believes the body should not reproduce because without body fat a babys growth in the womb could be stunted and without food to replenish the bodys energy reserves there will be nothing to feed the offspring
9357497 leptin works remarkably well to give the brain a good indication of how much food has been eaten 99 9 percent of the time it balances food intake with energy use
9357498 the problem is that no machine works 100 percent of the time and that slight bit of inefficiency can lead to extra body weight
9357499 try to make a way to make sure the brain signals are being heard
9357500 their hormones and blood sugar resembled that seen in humans with these disorders
9357501 we dont study infertility but we put two and two together
9357502 we knew leptin is the critical hormone for regulating body weight and that it is also very important for regulating reproduction
9357503 this suggests that half of the dose of torc switch is enough to cause problems in leptin signaling in the brain and it may be that subtle mutations in torc1 in humans could be responsible for an inheritable risk factor for gaining weight
9357504 torc1 is regulated by phosphate handling enzymes called kinases and kinases often make for very good drug targets
9357505 this is still a big ugly storm still strong and i encourage everyone to leave
9357506 i cant take a chance because so many people died in katrina
9357507 i was here for katrina and i was going to stay but this ones coming really bad and i decided to get out
9357508 the wind looks to be stronger this time im scared it will rip the roof off
9357509 it remains likely that gustav will prove to become a worse case scenario for the producing region and places the heart of the oil production region under a high risk of sustaining significant or major damage
9357510 telomerase is an ideal target for chemotherapy because it is active in almost all human tumors but inactive in most normal cells
9357511 that means a drug that deactivates telomerase would likely work against all cancers with few side effects
9357512 once we found that the gene from this organism expressed the protein in the quantities we needed we were able to move quickly
9357513 for the first time we can see how telomerase assembles at the end of chromosomes to initiate telomere replication
9357514 ive always been interested in understanding on a molecular level the function of protein nucleic acid assemblies and using that information in the treatment of human disease
9357515 telomerase because of its important role in cancer and aging was an obvious target for me
9357516 it required a lot of perseverance and effort but we really wanted to do this
9357517 these mice were normal and we could tell which were new nerve cells and they should be functional
9357518 we believe those neurons are very important for olfactory system sense of smell
9357519 normal mice quickly learn which hole to get to where its dark and has bedding for the mutants they learn where to hide but after a week they totally forget they completely lose their memory
9357520 this gene is crucial to the daisy chain of signals that run between body fat and the brain
9357521 it likely plays a pivotal role in how much we as humans eat and whether we have offspring
9357522 leptin tells the brain that times are good your body is full and that it is not necessary to eat more at the moment
9357523 controlling appetite and reproduction together provides a big evolutionary advantage
9357524 if there is no food the brain believes the body should not reproduce because without body fat a babys growth in the womb could be stunted and without food to replenish the bodys energy reserves there will be nothing to feed the offspring

9357530 we knew leptin is the critical hormone for regulating body weight and that it is also very important for regulating reproduction
9357531 this suggests that half of the dose of torc switch is enough to cause problems in leptin signaling in the brain and it may be that subtle mutations in torc1 in humans could be responsible for an inheritable risk factor for gaining weight
9357532 torc1 is regulated by phosphate handling enzymes called kinases and kinases often make for very good drug targets
9357533 as we continue to find genes that interact with each other and with environmental influences in this complex chronic disease we are building the foundation for personalized treatments tailored to a patients genetic profile
9357534 we will resequence the gene regions we have identified to pinpoint the causative mutations in these genes
9357535 we strongly suspect one gene will provide a compelling target for drug development given whats known about its biology
9357536 although the gene variants we found may have a stronger signal in pediatric ibd than in adult onset ibd we do not believe them to be limited to varieties of the disease that begin in childhood
9357537 as we better understand the complex gene interactions in ibd we may be able to diagnose patients by their genetic profile to predict who will better respond to anti tnf drugs
9357538 if better knowledge of the disease pathway enables pharmaceutical companies to develop anti tnf drugs in pill form the medications will be easier to deliver as well as more customized to each patient
9357539 we look forward to hearing how these serious people seriously claim that mccains vp selection is a serious choice and that they support it seriously carl hiaasen has some ideas on how these august rpofer delegates can maintain their seriousness at the convention

9357542 critics of charlie crists plan to buy 300 square miles of everglades sugar fields say we cant afford the 1 75 billion current events show why we cant afford not to buy it
9357543 win or lose black delegates and florida democratic party leaders say their national convention proved that the nation not just american politics has changed remarkably in sen
9357544 the myths perpetuated for years in florida by the large private property insurers are collapsing
9357545 now that charlie crist wont be riding shotgun on john mccains presidential campaign floridas left at the altar republican governor faces a critical juncture in crafting his national political resume
9357546 nothing has changed recently in floridas tax structure which punishes businesses by rewarding longtime home ownership though not renters or owners of commercial property
9357547 florida hasnt elected an african american to statewide office since reconstruction
9357548 though state rep geraldine thompson was stunned by what she saw thursday night a black man accepting the nomination for president of the united states the west orlando woman is still uncomfortable with what the ultimate outcome might be
9357549 labor day used to be a moment to celebrate worker solidarity and the power of the labor movement to secure rising living standards and a fair exchange for ones work but somehow we lost our collective consciousness leaving most of us to stand alone with the bargaining power of a gnat and the economic insecurity to show for it

9357556 we do not favour sanctions on the whole and only resort to them in extreme circumstances but if required we could pass the relevant legislation
9357557 any sanctions would hurt the european union first of all much more than russia
9357558 russia wants to be an equal partner but the partnership should not be the kind of partnership between the horseman and horse but of two equal individuals
9357559 the situation is very difficult and we must be firm on our position in offering a line defending of course territorial integrity of georgia
9357560 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9357561 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organisations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9357562 the dangerous spiral of violence over georgia must be stopped
9357563 we need a strong and sensible european role to allow a return to reason and responsibility
9357564 someone should first tell me what a sanction against russia could be
9357565 particularly in such a serious political situation it is necessary to show a bit of common sense
9357566 at 6 43am this morning local emergency services responded to a 999 call next to the campervan site at the electric to a privately hired specially converted double decker bus
9357567 the bed bus had been sleeping 12 people the call was initiated due to apparent carbon monoxide poisoning leaking form a faulty generator on the bus
9357568 one person was taken to the intensive care unit in portlaoise general hospital and now remains under observation and remains stable
9357569 the site medical team followed up with the remaining eleven people on the bus and sent a second person to hospital as a precaution
9357570 theres one patient in portlaoise hospital for observation she may be released this evening or released tomorrow
9357571 clearly we will be seeking to establish whether it is the body of christopher foster
9357572 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9357573 although this is now being treated as a murder we are keeping an open mind as to the circumstances leading up to the incident
9357574 the events which have unfolded in our village this week have bewildered and stunned every one of us not only in this community but across the country

9357586 well the alphas seemed to be more of a socialist society
9357587 well to me this piece seems to convey a certain message about the acceptance of laziness in it we see that a wheel which is perfectly capable of movement and capable of getting somewhere is not moving at all but is chosing to rest upon a stool an object that is used when someone sits or is not necessarily productive perhaps the artist was criticizing the status quo
9357588 in a book of al most 400 pages he can scarcely bring himself to concede that a single human benefit has flowed from religious faith a view which is as a priori improbable as it is empirically false
9357589 the countless millions who have devoted their lives selflessly to the service of others in the name of christ or buddha or allah are wiped from human history and this by a self appointed crusader against bigotry
9357590 if there is only one creator who made the tiger and the lamb the cheetah and the gazelle what is he playing at is he a sadist who enjoys spectator blood sports is he manoeuvring to maximise david attenboroughs television ratings
9357591 he seems to imagine god if not exactly with a white beard then at least as some kind of chap however supersized he asks how this chap can speak to bil lions of people simultaneously which is rather like wondering why if tony blair is an octopus he has only two arms
9357592 its quite inappropriate to have a session like that without putting forward a more con vincing view
9357593 i know of no serious properly done studies which make me feel that this is anything other than nonsense
9357594 one of the most dogmatic fanatical and crusading of the atheistic religions around now
9357595 the popularity of the paranormal oddly enough might even be grounds for encouragement i think that the appetite for mystery the enthusiasm for that which we do not understand is healthy and to be fostered it is the same appetite which drives the best of true science and it is an appetite which true science is best qualified to satisfy
9357596 todays paranormal beliefs probably seem relatively harmless they are not the reason is that if someone is willing to accept such claims on nonexistent evidence what else are they willing to believe
9357597 no rational basis for anything but self interest the collapse of moral philosophy is inevitable
9357598 to say that nature displays intelligence doesnt make you a christian fundamentalist
9357599 the fear of religion leads too many scientifically minded atheists to cling to a defensive world flattening reductionism
9357600 we have more than one form of understanding the great achievements of physical science do not make it capable of encompassing everything from mathematics to ethics to the experiences of a living animal we have no reason to dismiss moral reasoning introspection or conceptual analysis as ways of discovering the truth just because they are not physics
9357601 do not all charms fly at the mere touch of cold philosophy there was an awful rainbow once in heaven we know her woof her texture she is given in the dull catalogue of common things philosophy will clip an angels wings conquer all mysteries by rule and line empty the haunted air and unweave a rainbow
9357602 the girls in that office are just not very smart aka
9357603 this iraq war distracts us from every threat that we face and so many opportunities we could seize
9357604 this war diminishes our security our standing in the world our military our economy and the resources that we need to confront the challenges of the 21st century by any measure our single minded and open ended focus on iraq is not a sound strategy for keeping america safe
9357605 w hat i have said continuously is that in light of the problems that were having in afghanistan in light of other security threats that we have out there non proliferation issues iran what were doing with respect to china what were doing with respect to north korea it is important for us not to be single minded about iraq
9357606 shifts and faultlines in the world economy and great power rivalry
9357607 not just through military force but through the force of our ideas through economic power intelligence and diplomacy
9357608 a strategy that saw clearly the worlds dangers while seizing its promise
9357609 i warned that the invasion of a country posing no imminent threat would fan the flames of extremism and distract us from the fight against al qaeda and the taliban
9357610 since then more than 4 000 americans have died and we have spent nearly 1 trillion
9357611 ending the war is essential to meeting our broader strategic goals starting in afghanistan and pakistan where the taliban is resurgent and al qaeda has a safe haven iraq is not the central front in the war on terrorism and it never has been
9357612 we wont have sufficient resources to finish the job in afghanistan until we reduce our commitment to iraq
9357613 my plan would not be a precipitous withdrawal we would inevitably need to make tactical adjustments as i have often said i would consult with commanders on the ground and the iraqi government to ensure that our troops were redeployed safely and our interests protected
9357614 we cannot tolerate nuclear weapons in the hands of nations that support terror
9357615 do everything in my power to prevent iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon
9357616 we are more likely to succeed and will have far greater support at home and abroad if we have exhausted our diplomatic efforts
9357617 a s president i will make the fight against al qaeda and the taliban the top priority that it should be this is a war that we have to win

9357621 twenty years ago a scrawny little kid with a pointed nose and big ears mama from kansas and daddy from kenya
9357622 an ordinary black boy raised in a single parent home the boy walked into my office 20 years ago to talk about his dream for a community that concentrated on things that we could achieve in common things that united us rather than to focus on all the problems and the issues in the community about which we disagree or the things that divided us
9357623 the lord turned the ordinary into the extraordinary yall just saw it this past week it was on national television
9357624 this ordinary boy just might be come november the 4th this ordinary boy from a single parent home with a daddy from kenya and a mama from kansas this ordinary boy just might be the first president in the history of the united states to have a black woman sleeping at 1600 pennsylvania legally

9357803 oh we just had to cancel our coronation party holding it would be so unseemly
9357804 people are quick to scrutinize me when they really have no idea of what im about or why i have chosen to have these animals
9357805 we had several experts out at the thompson place including a number of veterinarians and even experts from the columbus zoo and they found nothing wrong
9357806 im not going to tell you that the animals out there are taken care of like you or i might take care of one of our pets but there is no one that can say their conditions are violating any statutes of law
9357807 we went to an exotic animal auction and terry bought me this baby cub as a present
9357808 i do not have these animals for money ive never sold an exotic animal and have no intentions of doing it
9357809 in a zoo youll see animals that are stressed everyday
9357810 here they are relaxed without conflict they know theyre loved and cared for
9357811 im not going to put anyone else including myself and my wife in danger or put my animals at risk i take extreme precautions with them and with people who come here
9357812 we had a safety concern and lt steve welker told mr thompson that he wanted some of the cages higher and some of the cages needed tops on them those issues have been taken care of to welkers satisfaction ive been told
9357813 the sheriffs office asked me to take some added precautions with some of my enclosures and thats what we did
9357814 but its not its a warm sound its their way of saying theyre happy if they werent making that noise then id be concerned
9357815 marian is a world state and national champion and not everyone is aware of that
9357816 i know exotic animal ownership has blossomed here in the last several years
9357817 we just couldnt find any laws that say someone cant own an exotic animal
9357818 i have them because i love them and am willing to do whatever i have to to take care of them
9357819 i have seven veterinarians on call at any time if one of my bears gets a hangnail i call a certain vet if a cat sneezes i call another vet i dont use the animals for commerce so im under no regulations like a zoo but i make sure my animals arent a threat to the community either
9357820 oh santa vergine esclam il buon prete fatemi la grazia se potete poi senza fare si alzi soltanto chi ha luccello in mano
9357821 just kill me you might as well kill me right now
9357822 we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9357823 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9357824 the 8th ward is still alive and the ties that bind are still binding
9357825 these are the matriarchs and patriarchs of the families who have been here
9357826 she lois hill makes these boxes of cookies that are to die for
9357827 she makes like 11 different kinds of cookies and gives them out at christmas
9357828 i come down to see friends family and loved ones because these are my roots
9357829 i can see families in the faces of the children and grandchildren
9357830 i came to see people i havent seen in a long time and to partake in good food
9357831 raymond fulton invited us i grew up on keen street but had not attended until this year
9357832 the whole neighborhood has changed there used to be a candy store right across the street
9357833 all the parents have passed away so its more or less the kids and grandkids who are here
9357834 i love my neighborhood i want to build a new home right here
9357835 we miss julia marsh because she was always such a big help and she donated gifts for door prizes and talking up the reunion
9357836 i could buy a bag of sugar to make fudge for 8 cents and a pound of bologna for 15 cents
9357837 the recovery from the recession of 2001 was a case of too little too late for californias workers
9357838 it took four years for the job market to rebound but those gains have started to come undone as the states unemployment rate hit 7 3 percent in july its highest level in 12 years
9357839 a security guard immediately rushed and grabbed the man who could be in his 40s but the man became violent and tried to assault the guard the guard however overpowered him and he dashed out of the bank totally naked and stormed into the bulawayo central police station
9357840 it was a shock to everyone because it happened when everyone least expected it some women screamed and others ran away but after a while there was a lot of excitement as everyone was talking about it after enduring a long wait in the queue perhaps it was the kind of drama needed to bring laughter to the people
9357841 the us 2 000 that other members got is an insult they shoud have been given at least half of coventrys amount mugabe is playing politics with the girl while he is telling the whole world that he hates the white man he turn and give coventry a white gitl such an amount ignoring his black brothers
9357842 morale is very low dzingai deserved such an amount considering that he was competing with that guy bolt of jamica in the 200 meters final we now wait and see what the paralypic team will get if they miraculously get gold in their games
9357843 kirsty is our golden girl and we should look after her we would like to urge other members of the team to work harder and with greater practice more practice we will get more medals in the future games
9357844 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9357845 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9357846 our coast guard responders remain always ready to assist the american public
9357847 there are some sig delays on i 12 east as you get farther into mississippi
9357848 were working with mississippi and now allowing traffic to get onto interstate 10 eastbound were hoping that that will help relieve some congestion on i 12 east
9357849 secondo me la roma aveva condotto bene la gara passando in vantaggio e tenendo bene il campo
9357850 i tre punti non sono arrivati perch abbiamo fallito qualche occasione di troppo e incontrato un ottimo napoli
9357851 forse sar stato il caldo ma pur mettendocela tutta la stanchezza si faceva sentire oggi andata cos ma il campionato lungo la mia prova potevo fare di pi cos come tutta la squadra il tempo per fare meglio c e lo sfrutteremo
9357852 non sono ancora al meglio fisicamente ma mi ha fatto piacere giocare nelloccasione del gol sbagliato mi venuto a mancare il piede dappoggio al momento della conclusione
9357853 hes only bit me one time in three years and it was my boo boo
9357854 i forgot to wash my hands after handling a mouse and he thought my thumb was a mouse
9357855 i dont want my kids to be scared of snakes and things but not me i cant touch it it gives me the willies just looking at it i know their important and all that and if they stay away from me ill stay away from them
9357856 its a good way to spend time with my mom
9357857 its wonderful its a beautiful day and theres lots for the kids to do
9357858 we messed up at first then we figured out how to do it
9357859 che ho letto allet di nove anni con molte riserve perch negava alle sirenette unanima
9357860 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9357861 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9357862 master we do not know where you are going how can we know the way
9357863 though shalt know him by mark firette this is a piece that our choir has used during advent but i felt the words described tracy i cannot remember them and i thought i had a copy but i do not
9357864 running any business youve got the bookkeeping the balance sheets the profit and loss its kind of a nice outlet to get the stress out
9357865 i want people who are animated and in motion and lively and friendly to everyone they meet rather than just a stick figure
9357866 thats one of the things that just gets me about a lot of these characters and especially the easter bunnies you see in a mall they might as well get a stuffed animal and set it in a chair because thats about what it is
9357867 id say we probably use him and his company 30 to 40 times a year
9357868 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
9357869 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
9357870 this is not just something we did at the first of the year
9357871 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
9357872 e greu s lu m titlul ne preg tim pentru locul 5
9357873 il questore di napoli antonio puglisi ha parlato con i leader dei tifosi a lungo per convincerli a desistere ma non c stato nulla da fare
9357874 scientists and researchers in climate and related fields economists policymakers and busin the polar bears are all right
9357875 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now
9357876 no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9357877 as a staff i was real happy with our communication chris beatty called the first touchdown pass and doc holliday called either the second or the third touchdown pass they bring the ideas up at the right time where im not thinking ahead
9357878 weve got five guys on offense including myself and weve come together as a staff theyre an absolute joy to be around
9357879 our first thought on offense was lets not take any shots
9357880 we need to get a couple of first downs and let the defense get gassed up again it was a hot day out there
9357881 if it was a run we stayed with the run and if it was a pass we stayed with the pass
9357882 i pledge that tomorrow night and if necessary throughout our convention we will act as americans and not as republicans because america needs us now no matter what we are republican or democratic america needs us to do what all americans have always done in times of disaster and challenge
9357883 i think its going to back them up a little bit
9357884 they may still come with 18 guys in the box and one safety but well see what happens
9357885 clearly with their game plan they were going to make pat beat them with his arm and i thought he did a good job today
9357886 i was pleased with his decision making fundamentally and athletically the kid has been blessed before i ever got a hold of him
9357887 i was just real happy with where his eyes went to on every pass play in order for those completions to occur
9357888 i was happy with the way he read coverage the way he handled protection and of course the way he delivered the ball
9357889 there were a number of times today and during patricks career when you go wow that wasnt a very good call and then old 5 gets you out of that bind hes certainly a blessing to coach
9357890 we dont call plays to try and have pat scramble and run but we know in the back of our heads that those are the best quarterback draws i often feel like when you do throw the ball if he does check it down to himself when everything is covered and he runs i told him it will keep me calling pass plays
9357891 but if he forces them into coverage we just cant do that and beat ourselves
9357892 it comes with confidence hes more confident with his throwing
9357893 hes put in the work and hes watched the film he always had it in him even last season
9357894 hes helped me a lot little things i guess can turn into big things
9357895 hes worked with us a lot on the little things and it happened to be a big day for us passing
9357896 we want to be a gun option football team we want to run the zone but unfortunately today for us the opponent wouldnt allow us to do that
9357897 i was happy with the way we threw it and we want to be a good throw team i did not come into the game with any thought process of throwing it a bunch especially when we got the lead i did not want to continue to throw it but we felt there was a faster chance of a three and out if we ran it as opposed to throwing it
9357898 teams are still going to load the box because we have the greatest one two running punch in college football in
9357899 once those guys load the box to try and stop those guys thats when were going to try and hit you over the top
9357900 bush to skip gop convention go to texas instead to meet with hurricane workers evacuees
9357901 the experience that she comes from is with what shes done in the government and also remember alaska is the closest part of our continent to russia so its not as if she doesnt understand whats at stake here
9357902 i asked her how do you feel about this this is two things you have to do is not only possibly be a vice presidential candidate but also you know listen to worry about your son
9357903 and she looked me square in the eye and she said you know something
9357904 we cant let it go we cant let a country come back in and take it back down to a soviet style government this is democracy and thats what were all about
9357905 the united states is the best at what we do were the ones that give the most and give the earliest every time something happens and id like to continue that and also encourage others to get involved you dont have to cross an ocean to be of help
9357906 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9357907 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9357908 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9357909 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9357910 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9357911 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9357912 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9357913 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9357914 its been following us all over cuba ruining our vacation
9357915 they have closed everything hotels restaurants bars museums theres not much to do but wait
9357916 atractivitatea romaniei nu trebuie sa mai fie reprezentata doar de salariile scazute ci de oportunitatea pe care o ofera pentru invesitii
9357917 the idea of fair trials and criminal justice systems interests me

9357921 porto con me i colori dei ponchi i giorni dei campi e un poco di te
9357922 porto con me la gioia di vita ma la strada non e finita il signore chiama ancora e io continuo anche grazie a te
9357923 it just seems like a huge white elephant that is not going to be used except for maybe three or four days of the month when the tides happen to coincide with the weather wind and the heat
9357924 i live in doorey st and i see boats going through at all hours of the night and if they bring more boats there its just going to make doorey st a thoroughfare really
9357925 a lot of the younger people have come in and bought houses and they need a park like this
9357926 the guys are going to go around there and do their tokyo drift out the back and just go round and round and round
9357927 but much of that is tidal wetland and what isnt tidal wetland is underlain by soils which are particularly difficult to put engineering on
9357928 not everybody is going to be happy and i suppose the balance is to try and provide some facility thats usable as well as not impeding on residents
9357929 too unstable too old it is the same story they gave us for the t amp g building and anything else they want to knock down
9357930 the reaction i am getting is the big end of town is running townsville and no one has any say
9357931 what we have done is had an engineer ascertain how it is at the moment and they decided it was completely unsafe should we undertake a residential development on the site
9357932 the restoration process would be significant if it is possible to be restored
9357933 a structure like that and i am not an engineer but would imagine it would involve a steel brace around the outside and about four columns around it up to 30 metres high
9357934 if we are going to enclose it to keep it up then it would defeat the purpose of remembering
9357935 but that isnt a decision that is appropriate for a developer to make i think it is more a case of the authorities deciding
9357936 it is the only one left in the district and it is vital to architecture as much as the monument to anyone who has anything to do with meatworks
9357937 keeping the helmet away from his mouth and offering comfort
9357938 it doesnt matter how fast youre going if you hit gravel like that
9357939 were appealing to all people to slow down and take care and consideration on our roads
9357940 ive been to the ed in a peak time and it haunted me to see the sort of pressure the staff were under
9357941 id like to see the health minister and the premier go in there and see what its really like at a peak time so they can see what were dealing with
9357942 were been trying to alert the government for 10 years and the sad part is theyve ignored our pleas about the hospital
9357943 he mr robertson indicated to me that there could be short term options which include freeing up of areas for patient beds
9357944 when i go into work tomorrow ill already be booked out for two days solid
9357945 they need to build another hospital or enlarge the current one dramatically they cant keep playing catch up like theyre doing now
9357946 i hope we get a government next year thats much more in tune with what the people of townsville need because this one has completely stuffed it
9357947 it is a tough time and to anyone who was left waiting in the ed i apologise
9357948 its not just townsville in this situation with high patient demand but thats not an excuse and were going to get those beds online as soon as possible
9357949 the premier says she is a regular visitor to townsville and will be there again at the next most opportune moment
9357950 wie geplant realisiert werden kann ist noch von der beantwortung einiger fragen abh ngig
9357951 bundesrat minister schmid muss die armee reformieren oder zur cktreten
9357952 schonungslos auf dass die armee ihre aufgaben immer weniger wahrnehmen kann wir m ssen ihre konzeption gr ndlich berdenken
9357953 es ist gro artig einen anderen teil des landes zu sehen
9357954 er w nscht ihr gl ck aber nicht zu viel
9357955 ehemalige b rgermeisterin einer stadt von 9 000 einwohnern mit null au enpolitischer erfahrung
9357956 das ist mehr als wir im gesamten vierten quartal 2007 gesammelt haben
9357957 kein medium in sterreich hat die gr e und toleranz gehabt auch den gegnern des eu vertrags eine stimme zu geben
9357958 die sollen nicht die steine auf den lter gewordenen herausgeber werfen
9357959 ich glaube dass wir sagen k nnen der 28 september ist eine zeit der abrechnung wahltag ist zahltag
9357960 das ist die schlechteste regierung die wir seit 1945 je gehabt haben
9357961 wer kein gef hl f r das eigene volk hat der darf sich nicht wundern wenn die w hlerinnen und w hler die eigene regierung in die w ste schicken
9357962 das ist keine staatspolitische haltung das ist reine parteitaktik die da gemacht wird und das ist ein schlechter stil
9357963 wir schauen schon drauf dass wir nicht die falschen mit staatsb rgerschaften ausstatten
9357964 der vfgh ist nicht gesetzgeber das letzte wort hat das volk und das letzte wort hat der w hler in einer demokratie
9357965 freiwilliges engagement gerade f r die sicherheit soll sich st rker lohnen
9357966 die liste an rechten die ein t ter vorfindet ist lang
9357967 konkret hei t das kein sozialabbau kein bildungsabbau und keine weitere privatisierung von landeseigentum
9357968 von diesem parteitag geht ein klares signal aus wir wollen eine minderheitsregierung aber die gibt es nicht zum nulltarif
9357969 wir wissen dass wir mit einem stimmenanteil von 5 1 prozent nicht die gesamte politik bestimmen k nnen
9357970 ein schulsystem das kein kind zur ckl sst dann trifft sich das vollkommen mit unseren vorstellungen
9357971 wenn ich mit den menschen in hessen rede auch in meiner eigenen partei dann wollen die immer noch den politikwechsel
9357972 das ist immer noch die selbe partei die uns vor zwei jahrzehnten das fiasko der abgewirtschafteten ddr hinterlassen hat
9357973 es sind teilweise sogar noch genau die selben leute die heute nassforsch verk nden jetzt wollen wir auch mal wieder ran
9357974 und deshalb solltet ihr sehr nachdenklich sein wenn ihr sagt ihr seid jetzt auch mal dran ihr seid es nicht mit sicherheit nicht
9357975 wir brauchen eine starke und besonnene europ ische rolle um eine r ckkehr zu vernunft und verantwortung zu erm glichen
9357976 wir sagen ja aber f r eine soziale und kologische union
9357977 wir sozialdemokraten weichen nicht zur ck wenn es um unsere haltung und glaubw rdigkeit geht das garantieren wir
9357978 auf dem weg der erneuerung einen gro en schritt weitergekommen ist
9357979 lo m s importante de la vida es la actitud
9357980 diriwayatkan oleh sayyidina ali bahawa rasulullah s a w telah bersabda berkenaan dengan fadhilat sembahyang tarawih pada bulan ramadhan antaranya
9357981 cre amos que no bamos a llegar vivos a los ltimos 20 minutos del partido pero al final hemos estado frescos
9357982 es dif cil formar un equipo en tan escaso tiempo no soy un entrenador llor n ni suelo excusarme con las situaciones pero esta plantilla se ha confeccionado en las circunstancias conocidas con el protagonismo de ra l borrero secretario t cnico con problemas de diligencias de fichas hasta ayer e incluso hemos tenido que recurrir a mario un jugador del filial
9357983 dada la austeridad y coherencia con la que se est n haciendo las cosas tenemos un magn fico equipo y aunque vamos a sufrir la afici n estar orgullosa de sus jugadores
9357984 afrontamos el inicio de campa a con un d ficit de 30 entrenamientos y tampoco hemos tenido rivales de entidad en la pretemporada adem s del curso anterior s lo he podido contar con tres jugadores poncho rub n com ndez y david dorta
9357985 hemos tenido acierto de cara al gol y en la segunda parte cuando m s huecos han aparecido nos hemos complicado con la expulsi n tampoco ellos han llegado con demasiada claridad y si bien nos han bombardeado por todos lados mi equipo ha estado serio contundente concentrado y ordenado la defensa ha sido una de las claves para ganar el partido
9357986 ha estado ordenado sabiendo lo que quer a y por momentos jugando muy bien ha tenido muchas acciones de rea pero con poca claridad y mi equipo ha llegado menos pero con mayor efectividad
9357987 con esta victoria no debemos sacar los pies del tiesto debemos tener mucha tranquilidad corregir errores e intentar que el equipo vaya creciendo paulatinamente
9357988 ning n planteamiento moral ni religioso y mucho menos trat ndose de un menor puede hacer abdicar a cualquier estado social y democr tico de derecho de sus m s elementales principios cual es salvaguardar el derecho a la vida
9357989 senza lucio non sarebbe nato per esempio baglioni dice in unintervista ad avvenire persino vasco rossi dice di essersi ispirato a battisti ma senza copiare da quello inglese o da quello americano con la sua originalit ha avviato un proprio filone
9357990 come per tutti i grandi talenti non ho un ricordo mi sembra che ci sia sempre
9357991 lui stato proprio grande grande grande cita la sua canzone era un genio un grande amico sempre pronto anche ad esibirsi per solidariet tony renis una volta gli ho chiesto di venire a esibirsi per i bambini malati di cancro e lha fatto per oltre unora
9357992 il connubio mogol battisti era irripetibile prosegue renis mai trovata unaltra occasione in cui la musica sposasse il testo e viceversa e stato un amico ha insistito insieme a mogol perch lasciassi la casa discografica rca per entrare nella nuova etichetta numero uno di mogol battisti lo incontrai la prima volta alla ricordi e abbiamo subito familiarizzato
9357993 perch in nessun altro brano c una simbiosi cos straordinaria tra musica e parole
9357994 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9357995 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9357996 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in

9358001 tuwing may seryosong usapan sa showbiz hindi nakakalimutan na mabanggit ang kanilang dating matamis na samahan punong puno pa rin iyun ng kiliti para sa mga mirong sinasariwa ang kanilang nakaraan
9358002 mahal nila ang isat isa kaya naman matindi ang kanilang pagpapahalaga sa kanilang relasyon binuo nila sa isipan ang isang magandang pangarap sa hinaharap
9358003 tao lamang sila na may mga kahinaan katulad ng karaniwan laging nagbabadya ang tukso at naghihintay ng mabibiktima nakaabang pala ang isang babaing malapit sa girlfriend ng lalaki para makuha ang pagmamahal ng huli
9358004 marami ang nagsasabing deeply in love talaga si showbiz personality sa kanyang ex sa katunayan ito raw talaga ang itinitibok ng puso nito bilang true love
9358005 para talagang pinagtagpo sila sa isat isa ng mga panahong iyun magandang pares at magkasundong magkasundo sa lahat ng mga bagay
9358006 kaya lamang talagang kung minsan ay biglang dumarating ang mga hindi inaasahang mga problema sa buhay isang malakas na bagyo ang dumating sa kanilang relasyon
9358007 abala kasi si original girlfriend sa pag aaral nakitang pagkakataon ito ng kanyang ma lapit na kamag anak na babae na naging misis kinalaunan ng lalaki para isakatuparan ang pang aahas
9358008 magaling dumiskarte ang kamag anak ng ex girlfriend ng lalaki kaya nga ito ang naging misis ng huli mas mahabang oras ang pinagsasamahan ng dalawa
9358009 hindi date ang tirada ng babaing ahas kundi pagpapaturo pero hindi tutorial ng lesson sa school kundi sa sining ng showbiz alam ng babaing naging misis ni lalaki na hindi ito papayag kung date ang kanyang agarang pakay
9358010 magaling talagang dumiskarte ang babaing iyun pilit niyang kinuha ang atensiyon ni celebrity figure sa pamamagitan ng pagpapaturo sa sining na ginagalawan nito
9358011 kunyari nagpapaturo ng sining pero target talagang alembungan ang lalaki kaya ng makakuha ng tiyempo ayun pinupog ni babae ng halik ang lalaking kanyang naging mister kinalaunan
9358012 kung palay na nga ang lumalapit sa manok mahirap talagang hindi tukain kahit sabihin mo pang may nakatayang mahalagang bagay dito laplapan to the max ang nangyari sa kanila
9358013 kung nasa isang shooting ang dalawa lumalabas na maraming take na nangyari kasi talagang inuumaga sila sa kanilang kissing scene
9358014 nag alinlangan talaga ang lalaki sa simula dahil isang kasalanan ang kanilang ginagawa lalo pat kamag anak ng babaing kahalikan ang kanyang kasintahan
9358015 tomodo sa kanyang investment ang babaing celebrity figure hindi niya pinalampas ang magandang pagkakataon na makasama ng mas matagal ang lalaki
9358016 nag aalangan ang lalaki kasi alam niyang siya ang target ng babae at mahal niya ang kanyang girlfriend na talagang true love raw nito
9358017 hindi naman pinagdudahan ang motibo ng babaing ahas na bumuntot sa shooting ni celebrity figure abalang abala rin naman sa pag aaral ang original girlfriend
9358018 tumututol ang kanyang isipan pero hindi kasing lakas iyun ng kuryenteng naibibay sa kanyang katawan ng babaing naging maybahay nito kinalaunan
9358019 todo todo kasi ang babae ibinigay daw ang lahat kaya naman hindi makatanggi ang lalaki malakas ang dating ng tukso ng alindog ng babae na nagbigay sa kanya ng kakaibang karanasan
9358020 naging negatibo rin sa isang banda ang pagkakaroon niya ng dalawang babae sa buhay pumasok kasi sa kanyang ulo ang pagiging pogi
9358021 nandoon pa rin ang pagiging mabait ng celebrity figure kahit sabihin mong pumasok na sa kanyang ulo ang pagiging pogi pero iniisip pa rin niya na mali ang kanyang ginagawa
9358022 sa taas ng level ng enjoyment nakakalimutan niyang mali ang kanyang ginagawa pero ganoon nga siguro masarap ang magkaroon ng dalawang babae sa buhay
9358023 hindi naman namatay ang kanyang pagmamahal sa orihinal na girlfriend lalong napamahal sa kanya ang babae dahil talagang tiwalang tiwala sa kanya
9358024 palipasan lamang niya ng oras ang second woman pero hndi niya inakalang ito pa ang kanyang magiging misis bigla lamang kasing umeksena sa kanyang buhay
9358025 nag enjoy siya ng husto dahil natikman niya sa piling ng second woman ang kanyang buong pagkalalaki in short they engaged in pre marital sex
9358026 konserbatibo ang tipo ng original girlfriend ng lalaki inererespeto naman siya ni celebrity figure dahil talagang true love siya nito
9358027 sa kabilang banda kabaligtaran naman ang dating ng other woman sobra ang pagiging liberated nito sa usaping sekswal kaya naman naging advantage niya ito sa pagkuha ng atensiyon ng lalaki
9358028 umaapaw ang kaligayahang natikman ng lalaki sa piling ni second woman natikman ni celebrity figure ang katuparan ng kanyang pagkalalaki
9358029 maaaring todo bigay siya sa pagsuko ng bataan kay celebrity figure pero isang matalino at magandang estudyante ang babae na hinahangaan sa kanilang unibersidad sa kapanahunan nito
9358030 marami rin siyang manliligaw na guwapo at ma yayaman dahil sa kanyang taglay na kagandahan pero talagang mas pinili niyang habulin si celebrity figure
9358031 maaring todo bigay siya sa ngalan ng pag ibig at abala sa paghahabol sa lalaking kanyang inahas sa napakalapit na kamag anak pero isang asset ta laga ang kanyang utak at kagandahan
9358032 nakapasok rin ang tinaguriang ahas na babae sa showbiz dahil sa impluwensiya ng kanyang pagmamahal sa lalaki nais niyang sundan ang yapak nito
9358033 naging sobra sobra ang panahon ng kanilang paglalapit dahil pareho na silang rumaraket sa showbiz mas naging mainit ang kanilang pagtatagpo
9358034 parang lalong lumakas ang loob ng second woman kasi mistulang isang lisensiya sa kanya ang pagkakapasok sa showbiz para makasama ang babae
9358035 hanggang sa proyekto magkasama silang dalawa parang nakatakda talaga silang magsama sa isat isa na parang hindi na maghihiwalay pa habambuhay
9358036 more time talaga ang nangyari sa kanilang dalawa may pagkakataon silang makilala ang isat isa sa haba ng kanilang pinagsamahan
9358037 medyo umangat na ang love triangle na namamagitan sa kanila alam kasi ng mga kasamahan nila sa trabaho na girlfriend ni lalaki ang close girl relative ni second woman
9358038 hindi na nga halos makilala ng lalaki ang kanyang original girlfriend na malapit na kamag anak ni second woman dahil mas madalas niyang kasama ang huli
9358039 puwede na nga siyang mahuli na may ginagawang milagro iyun bang lihim niyang relasyon sa second woman na very close relative ng original niyang girlfriend nagkakamali na kasi siya kapag kasama si original
9358040 iyun na nga ang nagiging problema nila parang may kulang kahit mahal nila ang isat isa mas inaagaw ang kanilang panahon ng kanilang mga ginagawa sa buhay tapos nakadikit lagi sa lalaki si second woman
9358041 katulad nga ng mga babaing tumitikim ng pre martial sex nabuntis siya dahil sa kanyang kapusukan nakalimutang mag ingat dahil sa paghahabol sa lalakim
9358042 malaki ang kanilang hinala na mayroon silang haharaping malaking problema na talagang tiyak na ikaya yanig ng kanilang mga angkan pero pilit muna nilang iwinaksi ito sa kanilang isipan
9358043 napilitan si second woman na magpasuri dahil na rin sa kagustuhan ng lalaki mahirap daw baka iba pa ang makapuna sa kanilang napapansin hindi nga sila nagkamali ng hinala buntis nga si babae
9358044 nais nilang makasigurado na talagang buntis nga ang babae kaya naman nagdesisyon silang humingi ng panibagong expert opinion sa ibang mga doktor
9358045 nakiusap ng husto ang celebrity figure sa mga doktor na panatilihing pribado ang kanilang paglapit sa mga ito dahil tiyak na magdudulot ng malaking kontrobersiya sa showbiz
9358046 tatalunin naman kahit papano ang sweetness ng tunay na mag asawa habang magkasama sila sa espes yalista kitang kita naman ang concern ng lalaki sa babaing napalapit ng husto sa kanya
9358047 hindi nagbago ang resulta positibo pa rin ang second at third opinions alam nilang aabot sila sa puntong iyun dahil talagang matindi ang kanilang mainit na tinginan sa isat isa
9358048 pareho silang nakatitig sa kawalan at walang ka kibu kibo malaki talaga ang kanilang kinakaharap na problema lalo malaking gulo ang ibubunga nito sa kanilang angkan
9358049 ano nga ba naman ang kasalanan ng bata kung saka sakali takot sila sa dyos kaya hindi sumagi man lamang sa kanilang isipan ang aborsiyon
9358050 tanggap na nila ang pagbubuntis pero napakahirap ipaliwanag sa pamilya ng second woman lalot hindi naman ito ang girlfriend ng lalaki kundi ang malapit na kamag anak nito
9358051 parang naging mas malaking balakid sa kanila ang pagtataksil na nagawa hindi ang pagbubuntis na nangyari talagang gulung gulo sila
9358052 hindi niya malaman ang mga salitang sasabihin bakit hindi nga naman ang kanyang kasintahan ang nabuntis at ang kamag anak nitong babae
9358053 umiyak ng husto si original girlfriend at tinanong niya ang kanyang napakalapit na kamag anak ng bakit ate hindi nito lubos maisip na mangyayari sa kanila iyun
9358054 hiyang hiya si celebrity figure para raw siyang ice cream na natunaw ganyan ang kanyang kuwento sa ilang piling mga kaibigan na nakakaalam ng kanyang naging masalimuot na karanasan nang pagsabayin ang dalawang babaing malapit na magka pamilya
9358055 ano pa nga ba ang kanilang sasabihin kundi ang mag sorry at humingi ng napakaraming paumanhin sa kanilang nagawang pananakit ng damdamin at pagta traydor
9358056 alam ni second woman ang danger ng kanyang pagkuha sa atensiyon sa lalaki mahal na mahal kasi ni celebrity figure ang orihinal na kasintahan na kanyang malapit na kamag anak
9358057 kung tutuusin dapat talagang masaktan siya sa mga pangyayari lalot harap harapan niyang narinig na mas pipiliin ng lalaki ang kanyang napakalapit na kamag anak sa kabila ng kanyang kalagayan
9358058 lumabas ang pagiging tao ni second woman labis ang kanyang kahihiyang naramdaman sa sarili lalot hindi naman iba ang babaing kanyang kinatalo sa ngalan ng pag ibig
9358059 handa siyang mawala ang lalaki sa kanyang tabi lalot inagaw niya lamang ito sa kanyang close relative pero malaking kaginhawaan ang kanyang naramdaman ng magparaya ito
9358060 sa kabila ng narinig nanatiling duda ang lalaki at second woman sa sensiridad ng sinabi ng babae lalot batid nilang malalim itong magmahal
9358061 naidiga na nila ang sitwasyon sa original girlfriend ni celebrity figure problema na lamang nilang dalawa ngayon kung papaano ito dadalhin sa kamag anak ng dalawang babae
9358062 talagang labis ang kanilang pagkagulat hindi nila lubos isiping nangyari sa kanilang pamilya ang kakaibang twist nang umamin ang lalaki at second woman sa naganap na buntisan kahit hindi ito ang tunay na magka relasyon na kanilang alam
9358063 bago sila nakaramdam ng galit sa kanilang mga dibdib labis muna silang natulala sa mga pangyayari kung tutuusin may katwiran ang mga kamag anakan na magwala dahil tinuhog ng lalaki ang dalawang babae ng magkasabay
9358064 iniisip kasi ng mga matatanda sa kanilang pamilya na tiyak na magkakaroon ng friction sa relasyon ng dating close pa man ding babaing magkamag anak
9358065 hindi man magandang maganda ang kanilang naging usapan katulad ng mga ikakasal kailangang ikasal sina celebrity figure at second woman dahil sa pagbubuntis ng huli
9358066 kahit masasabing showbiz people sila importante pa rin sa pamilya ng dalawang babae ang pagpapakasal dahil sa kanilang pangalang iniingatan
9358067 hinahabol nila ang panahon dahil talagang lalaki na ang tiyan ni second woman kung magpapatagal tagal pa sila sa kanilang mga plano
9358068 inamin rin niya sa bull session ng kanyang mga kamag anakan na siya ang may kasalanan sa nangyaring love triangle inakit niya ang lalaki kaya siya ang nadisgrasyang mabuntis sa halip na ang malapit na kaanak na original girlfriend ni celebrity figure
9358069 mahal na mahal talaga niya ang lalaki kaya nang makakita ng tiyempo at pagkakataong makasama ito sinunggaban niya ang lahat para makuha ito
9358070 alam niyang napakalaking kahihiyan sa pa milya ang kanyang pinaggagawa hindi siya nakapag isip ng mabuti dahil sa sobrang pagka gusto sa lalaki

9358074 it would be nice if we had had a clear benefit but the benefit of telmisartan was modest
9358075 how telmisartan can be noninferior to ramipril based on ontarget but barely better than placebo
9358076 illustrate the complexity of interpreting different patient populations and trying to come up with a conclusion
9358077 should remain the preferred renin active agent to prevent vascular events in patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease
9358078 support the use of an arb in those with an intolerance to an ace inhibitor for reasons beyond cough
9358079 however direct evidence of benefit of an arb in reducing major cardiovascular events in broader high risk populations is lacking
9358080 despite the patients being on similar concomitant drugs to those in transcend
9358081 it is unclear if this result reflects a lesser effect of telmisartan or if the benefit in europa was driven by a sicker population all had coronary disease in europa vs 75 in transcend
9358082 but the neutral effect on heart failure events was surprising
9358083 the nonsignificant trend in favor of telmisartan suggests there may be a more modest but significant effect in a trial designed to detect a smaller risk reduction at present a statistical and clinical benefit from telmisartan cannot be ruled in or out
9358084 the remarkable tolerability of telmisartan is emphasized by the fact that fewer individuals stopped medication if they were receiving telmisartan compared with placebo
9358085 these analyses suggest that there may be a delay of six to 12 months before the benefits of arbs emerge and that it could take several years of treatment for the full benefits to manifest
9358086 whether telmisartan is less effective than ace inhibitors in preventing heart failure
9358087 by contrast with previous trials of arbs our patients were not known to have left ventricular systolic dysfunction heart failure was an exclusion factor and few had left ventricular hypertrophy at study entry it is possible that when the absolute risk of heart failure is low ace inhibitors and arbs might not reduce the incidence of heart failure
9358088 overall data supporting use of arbs to prevent vascular events in various cardiovascular groups other than heart failure are incomplete
9358089 arbs that have been studied in coronary disease are safe but possibly less effective alternatives in patients with intolerance to ace inhibitors although data are too limited to reach definitive conclusions the clinical effect of arbs seems less robust than that of ace inhibitors
9358090 transcend would suggest that if the hope criteria apply it seems reasonable to use telmisartan as an alternative
9358091 but as the mechanisms are unknown behind the lack of effects on prevention of heart failure documented arbs candesartan and valsartan should be used in patients who already have heart failure
9358092 this shows that if you have good background treatment the arb effect is not as good as we have seen in the earlier studies the ace inhibitors should be what we use first
9358093 the whole issue of arbs or even ace inhibitors in people who havent got other indications such as hypertension or diabetes has to be brought into question
9358094 this trial failed its primary end point in beautiful and the conclusions that we can draw regarding the reduction in fatal and nonfatal mi are to a great extent hypothesis generating
9358095 theyre reassuring but theyre not definitive im not going to argue with that
9358096 one of the questions i would ask would be what if you had 90 of both groups on beta blockers would there still be a benefit of the new drug
9358097 the problem with beta blockers is they have side effects
9358098 in older patients you get depression in males you get impotence and in anyone you can get bradycardia so this drug is probably going to have a place in patients in whom you cant get the heart rate down until you make the patients sick with the side effects this may be a great addition
9358099 it will always be your first choice to titer the beta blocker first
9358100 i see no reason to change our current guideline recommended therapy for patients with lv dysfunction but i do think a prospective study is needed to look at effects of ivabradine on cad outcomes for patients with heart rates gt 70 bpm
9358101 the beautiful study has valuable lessons for clinical practice and illustrates the importance of individual decision making it remains to be seen whether or not the concept of the slower the better holds true
9358102 im not saying this is conclusive evidence but i think its very important and certainly it is at least evidence that we should be paying more attention to heart rate
9358103 what manipulation of that elevated heart rate does in terms of improving that outcome i think this study probably generates as many questions as it does answers
9358104 what about a head to head trial of bb and ivabradine
9358105 although this moderate benefit was smaller than was expected we should note that it was obtained in a population already treated with recommended therapies was consistent across all the predefined subgroups and was further supported by the findings of the per protocol analysis
9358106 questions remain about the mechanism of action optimum dosing and formulation supplementation with n 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa should join the short list of evidence based life prolonging therapies for heart failure
9358107 mechanisms of action in heart failure patients are broader than post mi patients
9358108 establish that although statin therapy lowers concentrations of ldl cholesterol is well tolerated and seems reasonably safe it does not produce meaningful improvements in survival in patients with chronic heart failure
9358109 what this study has done is extend what we knew from corona a study where more patients had severe heart failure to those with less severe heart failure
9358110 these effects might no longer affect the progression of coronary artery disease in patients with ischemic heart failure perhaps because their effect is attenuated by a biological milieu not favoring the progression of coronary artery disease
9358111 on the current path tropical storm force winds are expected to begin impacting the breaux bridge lafayette and crowley areas before noon on monday
9358112 once gustav makes landfall it will slow down and pose a significant rainfall and flooding threat to louisiana and texas
9358113 on the current path tropical storm force winds are expected to begin impacting the breaux bridge lafayette and crowley areas before noon on monday
9358114 both sides agreed that the verification process of released prisoners of one country held in the prisons of the other should be expedited and modalities in this regard will be worked out
9358115 this is an issue which needs much coordinated patrolling and intensive communication between the two border forces we will be working very seriously on the issue
9358116 international norms are there to deal with trespassers efforts would be made to reduce killings in the frontiers so that the things are done according to those norms
9358117 we should be able to cooperate each other beforehand even in absence such arrangements
9358118 we cant return anyone who is still in court custody
9358119 we will inform the bangladesh authorities about the terrorist or anti bangladesh outfits in india and discourage anti bangladesh political activities in line with our countrys policy
9358120 both sides agreed to take action against militants insurgent outfits and their leaders on the basis of real time and actionable information to be exchanged between the nodal points
9358121 the two sides agreed to find out the elements engaged in such illegal activities and bring them to justice
9358122 on the issue of construction of frontier fence within 150 yards of international border the bangladesh side stated that the matter would be further examined including joint visits to vulnerable sections of the border
9358123 i personally feel sorry about the matter it was an unexpected occurrence which had killed our valuable time in formulating the election laws
9358124 if this conflict didnt happen the representation of people order rpo could be finalised 2 3 months before
9358125 the nation expects much more from the political parties the election commission was recast as the political parties always wanted an independent ec
9358126 so it cannot be right if the ec suddenly tells that the political parties cannot have their wings or organisations new generation leadership is groomed through different front organisations the ec has to reconsider this matter
9358127 its impossible to change the party constitution abiding by the condition
9358128 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9358129 ive been watching paul play and he has been playing absolutely the best through the summer
9358130 he has an extremely good record in the ryder cup and going back the walker cup

9358134 we are pleased that this stay was granted by the faa s top attorney and believe that it shows that the slot auction faces a host of serious legal difficulties
9358135 with this order at least for the time being the faa avoids other litigation that it could not have won
9358136 though i may try out a pay per view with them
9358137 we have received numerous requests for assistance from local parish shelters and other animal welfare organizations in louisiana
9358138 we are working closely with the louisiana state animal response team to assist and provide resources
9358139 we are pleased to be able to lend our assistance both in terms of human resources and equipment in disaster relief efforts
9358140 by using our resources strategically and making key connections at the local levels the aspcas disaster response team is able to effectively respond to shelters and animals in need
9358141 hago literatura y teatro hace cinco a os realic la ultima telenovela en televisa
9358142 escribo para televisi n pero no soy exclusiva para esa televisora a m me interesa trabajar en equipo en la sogem falta un poco m s de acercamiento entre los autores para que se den cuenta de que todos somos iguales de que todos perseguimos el mismo inter s el bien de la sociedad hay una percepci n de divisi n entre las ramas pero estamos de acuerdo en que vamos en el mismo barco y tenemos que salir adelante
9358143 si un autor ingresa a la sogem 100 mil pesos se le regresan 85 mil y 15 mil son para la sociedad pero son 100 mil votos ahora ingresa m s dinero de gente de la televisi n y son los que tiene la mayor a de votos
9358144 quiere decir que han tomado en cuenta la labor que realic la cual no fue nada f cil porque ah se detectan las anomal as los problemas y se llevan al consejo
9358145 es una labor dif cil estar en vigilancia si se ven conflictos se deben ventilar y hay que proponer soluciones ah la dificultad mayor estriba en eso en convencer de que no se est realizando lo adecuado no se maneja dinero ni papeles s lo se observan
9358146 conocer m s a fondo muchas cosas que no estaban a mi alcance como el trato pol tico hac a el exterior de la sociedad
9358147 es lo que m s nos preocupa porque s necesitamos detener el d ficit la sociedad tuvo una poca de auge hace 20 a os hasta que empezamos a adquirir compromisos como los seguros de gastos m dicos y de vida para los autores adem s se fueron deteniendo los ingresos
9358148 por lo pronto lo desconozco porque no estaban dentro de mis funciones s lo supervisaba el funcionamiento de la sociedad no las relaciones exteriores con otras instituciones u organizaciones tengo que adentrarme m s a m me gustaba la pol tica general de rasc n banda yo siempre he dicho que soy apol tica y ahora no s a lo que me tenga que enfrentar habr que hacerlo porque ahora es de mi responsabilidad lo que acontezca con la sociedad
9358149 hay que mejorar los programas de estudio los maestros son muy buenos hay autores muy reconocidos que est n impartiendo clases actualmente tenemos menos alumnos las escuelas no son autosuficientes y eso es tambi n parte del d ficit hay que sumar que se abrieron las escuelas de escritores en televisa y tv azteca y tal vez eso perjudic
9358150 uno de mis prop sitos es siempre ir de la mano con el consejo directivo por lo mismo porque en este momento no estoy enterada exactamente de cu l es la problem tica en la televisi n s lo general entonces es muy importante que el consejo est m s cerca de los autores que se hagan juntas de rama peri dicamente para ir conociendo lo que va sucediendo d a con d a y tratar de resolverlo grupalmente
9358151 el cine va subiendo el a o pasado se produjo el doble de pel culas que el antepasado en radio estamos perdidos casi no tenemos nada nos han hecho propuestas y algo se ha hecho literatura no est mal el problema es que los autores firman por fuera no entran los contratos por la sogem como nunca se les pidi como requisito indispensable para ser socio que estuvieran cotizando tampoco ellos saben que pueden hacerlo
9358152 cuidando que sus obras se difundan de manera correcta y apegada a derecho teniendo como fundamento la libertad de expresi n con la finalidad de mejorar la cultura nacional
9358153 eso lo he escuchado pero yo vi a rasc n banda mantenerlo en un nivel
9358154 en realidad se trata de dos propuestas legislativas que se entrelazan pero que son muy importantes por s mismas por un lado proponemos la regulaci n del derecho de r plica y por otro para que ste pueda protegerse realmente planteamos el establecimiento del juicio de amparo en contra de particulares
9358155 proponemos en primer lugar un procedimiento simplificado para promover directamente ante el medio de comunicaci n la rectificaci n o respuesta sobre la informaci n que se desea aclarar la cual consiste pr cticamente s lo en la presentaci n de la solicitud escrita al medio acreditando el inter s jur dico en el asunto
9358156 en contraparte para quien se niegue a publicar la r plica se establecer a como sanci n que en la sentencia correspondiente el juez otorgue hasta el doble del tiempo o espacio que corresponda a la r plica solicitada
9358157 no se trata tampoco de una idea original estamos recogiendo b sicamente el texto de la reforma propuesta en 2001 por la suprema corte de justicia de la naci n a la ley de amparo con la nica diferencia de que mientras el m ximo tribunal del pa s propon a equiparar a los particulares como autoridades para que les fuera aplicable la ley de amparo nosotros planteamos que se extienda expl citamente la procedencia del amparo a los particulares que afecten los derechos fundamentales de otros particulares
9358158 por el momento se debe hacer la entrega f sica como la ley lo establece y hay que considerar las voces ciudadanas que se est n manifestando en las calles contra la inseguridad
9358159 lo que es seguro es que el informe ser presentado en el transcurso de la ma ana del 1 de septiembre ante las mesas directivas de ambas c maras encabezadas por el presidente horacio duarte con lo que se formalizar la entrega y la declaratoria de cumplimiento de la disposici n constitucional
9358160 todav a est por definirse para la hora el lugar espec fico dentro de san l zaro para cumplir con el mandato constitucional en los t rminos del acuerdo que alcanzaron ambas c maras del congreso el d a 28 todav a no se ha definido y hasta en tanto no se defina la hora y lugar se habr ya de concretar tambi n por parte del gobierno qui n ser el que acuda
9358161 we live in an area that is booming with young families
9358162 ive never had to advertise its all word of mouth
9358163 we decided to make the move to arizona and its worked out well for us
9358164 it was kind of nice for us to be mobile and to be able to move out of state
9358165 i feel bad for a lot of these people because they probably want to keep their roots in oregon theyve spent 10 years worth of their time in an industry thats now dead for them
9358166 my advice would be enroll now in college finish up two year degrees or four year degrees thats critical especially if they want to stay in that area
9358167 what it offers you as far as pay without even a two year degree is tremendous
9358168 often times when you get sucked into something like that you lose sight of the importance of getting a degree
9358169 this is the mother of all storms and im not sure weve seen anything like it
9358170 this is the real deal this is not a test for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9358171 i dont want to be stuck like i was in katrina
9358172 she wouldnt have articulated one coherent policy and people would just be fawning all over her
9358173 tony and i looked at each other and it was like this isnt about policy or alaska issues this is about peoples most basic instincts i like you and you make me feel good
9358174 i dont think a hillary person would ever move to her based on the issues
9358175 i dont think before today i would have ever heard someone call her a feminist
9358176 id have concerns that shed have the same negative impact on the nation that she has on alaska
9358177 there was some resentment there that some of us didnt come out and support her during the primary and it never really got any better
9358178 i found that if you disagreed with her or tried to amend or change something that was sort of off limits she did not like being told no or to change it
9358179 never really set out to be involved in public affairs much less to run for this office
9358180 it was good timing because it will help us out overall with our bills
9358181 if i work at it the potentials there to get financially stable enough that i dont have to worry about getting laid off
9358182 most everybody that ive talked to are in ok shape with whats going on
9358183 theres been a few people who had problems because they were worried about what was going to happen to their life
9358184 right now health care is big and its not a job area thats going to go downhill there are more and more clinics and hospitals and with a degree in health care administration im eligible to work for a medical dental or even a veterinary clinic
9358185 ill be able to be a full time student and that for me is a dream
9358186 since i moved out on my own when i was 18 ive pretty much been taking care of me and everyone else ive had in my life
9358187 if i was out on my own id be devastated that i dont have a job at this moment
9358188 but i really liked the schedule and i liked the pay so i was sad when they closed because i really liked my work
9358189 something that pays the bills and that ill enjoy doing
9358190 a lot of people are taking the opportunity to go back to school people are trying to get other jobs like at solarworld or temporarily going into different careers hoping that the plant opens up again
9358191 why we cant walk more than one puffle at a time
9358192 hahahaha i like to see mam u on top of things again
9358193 good strike by bent to take advantage of a 150k error lol
9358194 i will speak to artur see how he feels and we will analyse it from there
9358195 i thought it was a good game but we dealt with their aerial threat and there was a minimum of chances
9358196 i felt comfortable and was looking forward to the second half
9358197 but through some bizarre goals and an excellent strike we found ourselves in a position which was difficult to claw back
9358198 if i was displeased i would tell the players first we will look at the game again on monday
9358199 in two out of three previous seasons we have lost the first old firm game and gone on to win the title so we can do it but it needs to be a great effort again
9358200 there is nobody in for him at the present moment so he is staying here and well continue to use our strikers
9358201 he has been inconsistent since he came here but as he showed today he has that capability he is excellent when hes on form like today
9358202 it used to be a feature of play in the game a battle between the centre forward and centre half
9358203 yes they were fouls but there was no malice between daniel and gary caldwell
9358204 it was two players committed to winning the ball its a shame it ends up with a decision like that
9358205 i played a correct match and am happy to be in the third round i played well and hit some good backhands he started to get into the match in the second set and started to play much better in the third but the important thing is that i was able to react in time after going down 0 3 to win the set
9358206 hes playing really well and after reaching a final in washington recently arrived here brimming with confidence hes a player who serves well and has strong aggressive ground strokes
9358207 lo descargo ahora que luego me ha de servir para algo
9358208 we never put any blame on berbatov for the last two results
9358209 he wasnt there on the park so it was those on the park it was those on the pitch that were to blame and it was the same players that are responsible for putting in that great performance today and getting a fantastic result
9358210 i think that what will happen is that once the window is closed we will have more options
9358211 with the arrival of pavlyuchenko and anyone else who joins at the last minute well have more options on the field up to now darren bent has been working hard on his own and we havent had options
9358212 lets hope this result can ignite the season it was a great performance and result and lets hope it is positive ahead
9358213 the passing of the ball was half decent by both sides but its all about brilliance which is what mendes did
9358214 they had a bit of brilliance and we had two individual mistakes

9358233 i have kalou if you ask arsene wenger he wants kalou as a centre forward and arsene is an intelligent man
9358234 he wanted kalou two or three months ago when we started negotiations for some players i said no
9358235 if he loves kalou as a number nine i try it sometimes but i have anelka drogba and franco di santo
9358236 for me we played well i think we need to respect tottenham and the quality they have sometimes it is impossible to win
9358237 it was an interesting derby and a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot
9358238 they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create
9358239 providing a steady hand in rough economic waters not offering either major tax cuts or spending initiatives and certainly not raising taxes
9358240 the algoma highlands conservancy is known for its conservation and protection of the natural environment and lands i applaud the ontario trillium foundation for seeing the value of this proposal
9358241 we recognize the importance of protecting this sensitive king mountain area as an island surrounded by land subjected to sound sustainable forest management
9358242 the result is a wonderful win win situation for all concerned the ahc astina stokely creek lodge and the user public
9358243 lentusiasmo popolare si trasformi con umilt e pazienza in mentalit vincente e lavoro costante per competere con avversari di grande spessore
9358244 it hasnt been positively identified yet but we believe it may have come from the missing aircraft
9358245 it didnt bother me at all we wanted to create the environment where the guys felt pressure to perform i thought it was great if anything it got the guys fired up
9358246 its important because it makes us see how good we are and how good we need to be but its not important
9358247 itll be 6 1 2 months before we play a meaningful game and seven months before they might play a meaningful game you dont get too fired up about wins and losses now i think our guys understood what their flaws were in general we played really hard
9358248 whether its here in canada the states or antarctica the opponent is going to be good its becoming more of a global game
9358249 this is always a huge game regardless of our records we have enough reasons to make it even more pressing and important on our list of things to do here this afternoon
9358250 so we have a lot of wrongs to right at this point of the season and this is point one of many things we need to do to check off
9358251 ive thought about this game but not just as a revenge thing for the grey cup last year just moreso playing a good team like this
9358252 playing this team is a good measure theyre the best team right now so getting a win against them would show that were capable of beating the best team in the league
9358253 hes won games and hes a good quarterback hes proven himself in this league so were going to have to contain him
9358254 its been crazy but its been fun and im going to get an opportunity today to get out there and play
9358255 my career has been kind of crazy back and forth now ive got a fresh start with people that i trust thats the main thing that i wanted for my career every time youre surrounded by people that you trust and the great guys in the locker room the skys the limit you pick up your play you pick up your practice play and thats something that ive been missing for a couple of years
9358256 they probably think weve got their rings and whatnot but i dont know why anyone would think that
9358257 you play one game and whomever wins that game is the best for that year
9358258 youre doing yourself an injustice if you believe that this game is more important than the first game of the season or the grey cup
9358259 im excited about going to tampa my no 1 priority was to stay with ottawa but it didnt work out and now i have to get ready for a new challenge
9358260 the money just wasnt going to work there i understand the business and the way things go
9358261 the senators were the team i wanted to be with when this started but it just wasnt going to work
9358262 they were the team that drafted me and i wanted to stay there they decided to go in a different direction they got good players in kuba and picard those guys are good defencemen who are going to help them
9358263 schubert was surprised were going to miss each other but well definitely get a chance to see each other when the two teams play each other
9358264 the acquisition and signing of andrej is a strong statement to our players and our fans that the lightning ownership group is committed to putting the best product on the ice now and for years to come
9358265 andrej will be a very big part of our hockey club moving forward at 22 years of age he will only continue to improve and mature as a player
9358266 they have talked to me about the 4 4 game not the league cup one mistake in the last two minutes meant they lost the premier league
9358267 they also told me they respected some of the tottenham players and at this moment it is important for tottenham not to lose another game
9358268 they want their first three points in the league so we have some problems we know this we need to respect them even more
9358269 if you win a derby it is fantastic when i arrived here some people said to me you need to win three derbies tottenham fulham and west ham
9358270 tottenham thought they would have a better start to the season than they have done because they have lost both games
9358271 but i know juande and the players at tottenham they made one or two mistakes in the games before ours but we need to remember this is a big chance for tottenham because it is a derby
9358272 at the momemt we owe something to our fans but we can and we must give a lot more and thats what we are working on
9358273 the team have to improve we need to be ambitious and keep our concentration for the full 90 minutes
9358274 we are more concerned with the errors we have made in the last few games rather than obsessing about achieving our first victory
9358275 a draw for me is a normal result because we had more chances but made mistakes in the final shot
9358276 i think we need to respect tottenham and the quality they have i dont think anyone in this room thinks that tottenham are nothing they put eight or nine players at the back and it is difficult to create
9358277 i told the players a draw is ok but we need to try to work the ball more if they make a mistake it is not a problem if we play high balls i win one time and lose eight
9358278 in the first half we were paying too much respect to our opponents maybe we were overawed by chelsea and the stadium in the second half that was a thing of the past and we managed to keep hold of the ball and our performance meant we deserved the point we got
9358279 people always tell you about games against celtic but i think you probably need to play in one to really live it
9358280 they are special fixtures for the supporters and i really hope i get the chance to take part and that my team mates and i do as well as possible
9358281 i have enjoyed my time in scotland so far and everything is going well both on and off the pitch
9358282 the lads in the squad have been fantastic and my family are here so i am happy with life as im playing well too
9358283 we will work hard and make sure we are ready for celtic i can only speak about how weve done since i joined rangers but i think we have done well
9358284 based on the last couple of performances i think the team is improving and we just need to keep looking to do that now im looking for three points against celtic
9358285 it was a good performance against falkirk and sets us up mentally for the rangers game
9358286 i played three times against rangers last season and the atmosphere at both celtic park and ibrox is fantastic
9358287 for me it is one of the best derbies in the world and im just really glad im part of this
9358288 we are delighted to announce that we have reached agreement with spartak moscow for the transfer of roman pavlyuchenko to the club
9358289 do i have a good relationship with martin oneill i dont think so
9358290 but of course i will shake his hand i am a calm man and i do not have any problems with him about that
9358291 i had a good relationship with martin oneill before this summer and i was surprised at what has been said but i insist that i have not spoken to him since april
9358292 but i do not believe there will be any problem shaking hands we can do it
9358293 thats all ill be doing that wont be strange at all
9358294 ive spoken to the manager and ive no problem giving 100 percent for aston villa and that will be starting against liverpool on sunday
9358295 all i can do is give 100 percent for the club that is all the fans will want to see anyway i am sure that will be enough
9358296 this is a club on the way up and things have got better and better every season since i was last here
9358297 newcastle united can confirm that captain michael owen has been offered an extended and improved three year contract
9358298 the proposed terms of the new deal include an increased salary for michael and demonstrate the clubs commitment to keeping him
9358299 the club hopes that this enhanced contract offer will keep him at st james park
9358300 im optimistic we were unlucky it was a strange and unusual match but i think they are the surprise of the day
9358301 i dont think we were missing much in the team we attacked for 90 minutes and were punished by the two chances bologna had
9358302 we could have been more compact and together but from a physical perspective we couldnt have done any more than that
9358303 the result was fair because we werent able to close out the match but a draw at a difficult ground is not a big drama
9358304 im not super happy but the team didnt play badly
9358305 i am feeling fine i am feeling really good and my recovery is going well
9358306 i am more than happy with my progress and i hope to be back playing for united by the end of september that is my target and it is a realistic one
9358307 that is down to the defeat at manchester city not just the league cup performance against macclesfield ive not heard of fans having a go at a manager after two games before
9358308 these fans are second to none at times though when they are not happy they let you know about it but id rather they have a go at me than the players
9358309 im delighted to get this result but everyone in the dressing room knows we can play even better than this
9358310 it was a disappointing result and not a real reflection of the game for us because we played well
9358311 its like a circus when i come back here with the reception but ten or 15 thousand of the supporters here were not even born when the incident happened
9358312 i still love this club and i am pleased for alan because this gets people off his back he is a class man
9358313 however we deserved more here and had several chances to score before their goals in injury time
9358314 ive spoken to john toshack the wales manager as there is no way he is ready for international football
9358315 craig has obviously been out for four weeks with a hamstring injury and 20 minutes was as much as he could play it was good to have him back and he gives us something different out there
9358316 wales will call him up but i hope sense prevails ideally wed like him to train some more i just think its a bit early for him
9358317 manchester city fc can confirm that argentinian defender pablo zabaleta has signed for the club today from espanyol for an undisclosed fee
9358318 we feel the addition of pablo is another great signing for manchester city
9358319 hes young and a winner with an olympic gold medal to prove that but more so he will provide us with great balance in the side
9358320 im very happy to bring him here and hopefully we can get a good result at sunderland to round off what has been a very satisfactory week indeed for us
9358321 in the second half we managed to get a second and added one quite quickly after that which gave us the upper hand it was always going to be difficult for celtic to come back after that
9358322 in the end it was a terrific victory for us at a place where it is difficult for any team to get a win
9358323 at half time i couldnt see that coming i thought it was a good game and at half time we were looking forward to the second half
9358324 through some bizarre goals and one excellent strike we found ourselves in a position where it was hard to win the game
9358325 if he is still in the squad yes he could play for us if not he wont
9358326 i dont know where he was because he was not here he was not in the right state of mind to play
9358327 the problem is the money is not for me it is for the club
9358328 we never put any blame on berbatov for the last two results
9358329 he wasnt there on the park so it was those on the park it was those on the pitch that were to blame and it was the same players that are responsible for putting in that great performance today and getting a fantastic result
9358330 if you ask arsene wenger he wants kalou as a centre forward and arsene is an intelligent man i need to follow this way
9358331 he wanted kalou one two or three months ago when we started negotiations for some players
9358332 profoundly regretted the behaviour of chelseas directors who despite knowing perfectly well the decision not to sell the player have continued to make statements and gestures even going as far as to sell shirts with the players name through their official web site
9358333 all this has done is to cloud the situation and confuse public opinion
9358334 ive already told the president ramon calderon and coach bernd schuster management and the media my head is there at chelsea i want to play over there
9358335 until now ive never had a problem in the locker room at real
9358336 just before an important official match real madrid feels that all of its attention should be focused on the game a criteria that has been completely ignored by its player robinho with the statements he made just hours before the match
9358337 the problem is that real madrid did not manage to recruit
9358338 schuster isnt my father hes my coach he cant make me do anything
9358339 i dont know what capello will want to do because he has people like wayne rooney available as well but id expect to see jermain in the squad
9358340 he was really sharp ive been waiting for him to come good so it was nice to see him playing well and scoring a couple of goals
9358341 both him and crouchy are claiming the third goal when peter headed it in after it bounced down from the crossbar but i think it was already over the line
9358342 jermain was unbelievable when he arrived from spurs last year and he was on fire but he missed out on the fa cup run because he was cup tied he is a fantastic little player though he can score goals and he has great ability and confidence but those two goals will be good for him
9358343 all we need now is for crouchy to get off the mark and then we can really go forward him and defoe are a big un and little un so they should work really well as a partnership
9358344 our first two games have been so tough we didnt play well at chelsea but they are so strong at home and then we lost to manchester united so it was very important that we didnt go into the international break without a win
9358345 against chelsea united and everton last season we picked up just one point from the same fixtures so we are already better off than we were last year
9358346 saha wont be finalised until monday now but i am going to try to get some more players in we are lacking quality at the moment and we need more players because we arent ready to win premier league games at the moment
9358347 we have phil jagielka a centre back playing in midfield and jack rodwell who is just 17 james vaughan is playing up front for us but he still needs about a month of games in the reserves
9358348 those arent necessarily the ones that are letting us down though
9358349 joey came on got a good tackle in on nasri and then the guy sliced him down thats what happened and thats what i was upset about
9358350 i like nasri very much hes a player we looked at for a possible signing last year but you cant do things like that if it had been the other way round and a newcastle player had done that i wonder what the reaction would be
9358351 i know the referee didnt see it but the linesman did and it should have been a red card i will tell arsene wenger the same thing when i see him and i told nasri that at the end as well the fact is that joey has done nothing wrong
9358352 nasri clipped barton and there was a little incident between but he was booked and rightly so
9358353 we had great balance movement and penetration we were in control and we played the game that we love and the game that we can play at our best
9358354 we could have scored more goals but im also pleased that we didnt concede
9358355 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9358356 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
9358357 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
9358358 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
9358359 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
9358360 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
9358361 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
9358362 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them

9358373 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
9358374 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

9358377 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
9358378 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
9358379 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
9358380 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
9358381 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline

9358392 we have a real opportunity to get something done by working together and i am so pleased to announce that our bipartisan group has added more senators to it and i feel confident we will continue to see it grow once we resume session after labor day the american people are looking for action on the energy crisis they are not looking for a political issue they simply want to be able to make ends meet without having to make difficult budget decisions
9358393 we all feel a sense of urgency to help ease fuel prices in the short term while addressing our long term needs this comprehensive bipartisan framework is now backed by a gang of 16 because it puts every option on the table
9358394 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
9358395 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
9358396 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
9358397 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
9358398 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
9358399 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
9358400 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
9358401 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
9358402 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
9358403 a lot of people have this idea that its onerous and not fun sit up straight and eat your vegetable kind of thing
9358404 an awul lot of americans drive like theyre in a drag race when they come out of a stop sign or traffic light you dont have to do that and just that one change alone you can save 20 to 30 percent on gas consumption
9358405 a lot of americans drive with their foot on the gas or on the brake theres a third option which is your foot on neither just let momentum carry you
9358406 in general be very aware of all the traffic around you coast where you can without disrupting traffic flow use cruise conrtol
9358407 im looking at the flow of traffic and looking for the ways to save gasoline without triggering road rage in my fellow drivers
9358408 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9358409 we are right now investigating who was the driver of the vehicle and we also recovered a quantity of cocaine and marijuana from some of the occupants from the vehicle
9358410 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9358411 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
9358412 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
9358413 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
9358414 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
9358415 it wasnt that i was looking for a job i saw a great place here
9358416 it was an institution on the cusp and ready to grow
9358417 im just proud that we have a community college thats accepted by the community the way it is that the community recognizes the value of this community college
9358418 if thats an achievement ive had something to do with thats fine
9358419 almost all the awards here are awards that have been given for my work with students
9358420 thats why this building is named after him hes a very student centered person
9358421 not every student gets to work directly with the president
9358422 this has been a great year in itself at the college
9358423 i want a president to come here and gain the same kind of support from the community that ive received
9358424 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9358425 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9358426 when we opened the door the dog actually rescued himself
9358427 the dog left the building as soon as we opened the door
9358428 its overwhelming it really is it just shows what geneva a small community can do
9358429 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
9358430 ich gehe davon aus dass der b rgermeister die n chste b rgerschaftssitzung am mittwoch nutzt um reinen tisch zu machen
9358431 hamburg hat einen b rgermeister der probleme mit der wahrheit hat
9358432 ich hoffe es ist nicht so schlimm wie ich denke
9358433 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
9358434 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
9358435 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
9358436 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
9358437 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
9358438 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
9358439 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
9358440 who are open to doing something on the production side
9358441 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
9358442 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
9358443 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
9358444 ich wollte dieses spiel nur genie en ganz gleich was die zukunft bringt
9358445 und es dem trainer so schwer wie m glich machen mich rauszunehmen
9358446 ich hatte mir vorgenommen bei meinem ex verein nicht so sehr zu jubeln
9358447 aber es war so ein irres spiel da waren so viele emotionen drin das musste raus ich glaube aber ich habe das noch ganz dezent hinbekommen
9358448 ich glaube nicht dass er in zukunft hattricks macht aber bei standards ist er absolut einer der besten in deutschland
9358449 ich wollte dieses spiel nur genie en egal was kommt
9358450 zwei monate sp ter hatte ich meinen ersten auftrag in los angeles
9358451 in der zeit wurde ich erwachsen lernte waschen und kochen
9358452 eugen lief schauen in new york und ich ging noch im dorf zur schule
9358453 ich bin nun selbst bookerin bei der agentur mega model ich wei wie viele menschen bei einem shooting dabei sind
9358454 ein kuss f rs foto ist noch weniger als ein filmkuss
9358455 falls ich bei den shootings abhebe holt mich meine familie auf den boden zur ck
9358456 leider ist mein leiblicher vater in russland drei jahre danach gestorben ich habe ihn nie kennengelernt aber mein stiefvater ist f r mich wie mein papa
9358457 f r mich ist deutschland das sch nste land die sauberen stra en die leckeren br tchen das vermisse ich alles in new york
9358458 in new york gehe ich f nf mal die woche ins fitness studio
9358459 die agenturen wollen definierte jungs aber keine bodybuilder deshalb mache ich nur klimmz ge und liegest tze
9358460 weil ich jobbedingt viel reise bin ich hier eher entspannt wir treffen uns oft mit freunden und springen im sommer von der krugkoppelbr cke in die alster
9358461 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
9358462 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
9358463 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
9358464 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
9358465 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
9358466 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
9358467 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
9358468 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
9358469 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
9358470 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
9358471 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
9358472 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
9358473 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
9358474 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
9358475 wir haben es jetzt schwarz auf wei dass die cdu mit ihrem polizeigesetz an vielen stellen weit bers ziel hinausgeschossen ist und schwarz gr n nun korrigieren muss
9358476 manche bestimmungen haben sich durchaus bew hrt manche weniger wir sind gespannt wie die schwarz gr ne bewertung ausf llt
9358477 in diesem jahr l sst sich noch nicht absehen wie der altweibersommer werden wird
9358478 der august war zu feucht und hatte zu wenig sonnenstunden
9358479 wenn mir etwas passieren sollte informieren sie bitte meine schwester
9358480 wir werden alle spuren von damals erneut bewerten und die zeugen noch mal befragen
9358481 we have already achieved peace let us hold on to it and never allow the atrocities to happen again the government is always at hand to help empower our people and give assistance to uplift their lives
9358482 these valiant soldiers risked their lives to restore peace and order in areas where kato sow terror and violated the rights of the innocent resident
9358483 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
9358484 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
9358485 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
9358486 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
9358487 f r polen haben wir das ja schon fter gemacht ich glaube es wird gut funktionieren
9358488 f r neves mehr als zehn millionen euro zu bezahlen das ist schon mutig
9358489 und das von dem vertreter eines klubs der sich schwertut bei heimspielen seine zuschauer zu z hlen und sich st ndig um tausende verz hlt da sollte er sich besser nicht an millionen versuchen
9358490 prendi oggi e cominci a pagare in comode rate fra sei mesi
9358491 scrisse che lurss aveva fatto bene a togliere la cittadinanza a solgenitsin
9358492 prendi oggi e cominci a pagare in comode rate fra sei mesi
9358493 ich wei also nicht was am ende f r uns rausspringt aber diese neue qualit t gibt uns noch mehr selbstvertrauen
9358494 im vorjahr war es noch so dass wir hinten immer die null halten mussten um ein spiel gewinnen zu k nnen
9358495 auch nach dem 0 2 war mir klar dass chancen und tore kommen w rden wenn wir so weiterspielen
9358496 dass niemand bei uns hektisch wurde da hat sich keiner angemacht
9358497 wir haben jetzt einen guten start hingelegt obwohl die vorzeichen nicht g nstig waren
9358498 fr her mussten wir immer die null halten um zu gewinnen
9358499 bisher liegt uns keine aktualisierte bau und kostenplanung und wirtschaftlichkeitsberechnung vor
9358500 seit m rz ist der bezirk altona f r die schanze zust ndig
9358501 jetzt ist es schon wieder das gleiche wir warten auf das geld
9358502 w ren wir nicht geweckt worden w re unser gesamtes hab und gut wohl den flammen zum opfer gefallen
9358503 das hat uns v llig aus der bahn geworfen jeder tag an dem wir mindestens 15 zuschauer haben sichert uns das berleben
9358504 wir machen oft in sozialen brennpunkten halt aber diese aggressivit t ist uns neu
9358505 noch bevor ich am donnerstag zur s bener stra e gefahren bin habe ich bei obi einen karton gekauft und da ein paar sachen reingelegt auch meine schuhe die kiste lag am flughafen im auto
9358506 dann hat unser trainer mich in seiner coolen art gefragt ob ich sachen dabei h tte
9358507 do not put yourselves in harms way or make rescue workers take unnecessary risks
9358508 and know that the american people stand with you well face this emergency together
9358509 the message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9358510 i do not want my visit to impede in any way the response of our emergency personnel
9358511 i hope to be able to get to louisiana as soon as conditions permit
9358512 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9358513 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9358514 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9358515 this is the sort of early season cold front we typically dont see until late september
9358516 we need you to leave and we need you to leave today
9358517 are totally on your own in regards to resources to sustain life
9358518 but new orleanians are very resilient very tough and well get through this
9358519 if we have anything it will be street flooding and hopefully not that bad
9358520 things we were doing during katrina we already did two weeks ago
9358521 as long as its out of harms way its ok
9358522 im getting out of here i cant take another hurricane
9358523 if you dont go out of your house and stay put you should be fine
9358524 i dont think ive even cried from katrina yet i havent had time
9358525 there is no question we are taking this storm seriously
9358526 if we dont get the wind and rain we stand ready to help them
9358527 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9358528 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9358529 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 percent of the population
9358530 ich hoffe dass oberhausen auch gegen uns diese abwehrschw chen zeigt
9358531 blo nie wieder verlieben lieber zu hause bleiben und ein buch lesen
9358532 wenn ich nur halb so viel wie er hier erreiche bin ich zufrieden
9358533 aber meine freunde aus der bundesliga haben mir zu diesem wechsel nach hamburg geraten
9358534 ich hoffe meine neuen kollegen sind darin gut denn ich bin es auch
9358535 what the state government doing is negligible but the centres approach is very generous
9358536 then why did the breach occur at 11 am the very next day
9358537 it is total negligence on the part of the state government
9358538 the matter became clear only after i sent union minister of state for water resource jaiprakash narayan yadav to take stock of the situation his report led to the aerial survey of the affected areas
9358539 making it is the highlight of my season but i want to be a valuable member of the team
9358540 last week in holland i got the job half done and it was nice to sign seal and deliver it here
9358541 i stalled in the middle of the whole campaign and it became hard work but i think that that spurred me on to play well
9358542 im very very pleased its going to be a thrill
9358543 i had a feeling i did the job last week and it was just a matter of playing solid the first two rounds this week and i did that
9358544 i take a lot of confidence from the way i came through on friday
9358545 i felt if i missed the cut that was pretty much it
9358546 my aim was to make ollie wilson sweat a bit and i did
9358547 im very very proud of what i did today what ive done all week all season really
9358548 i think i showed real character to come back my mum would be very proud too
9358549 the way i bounced back was superb and ive shown fighting spirit and passion my girlfriend and i were laughing last night its typically dramatically me for it to come down to the last four or five holes
9358550 it was definitely a tough day i remember last year at loch lomond i was up and down from the trap also
9358551 egi hat mich richtig klasse gecoacht mir st ndig anweisungen gegeben ich bin sehr zufrieden
9358552 ich hatte einen extrem trockenen mund ich habe noch nie so oft am spielfeldrand getrunken
9358553 ich wollte diese chance unbedingt nutzen und hoffe in zwei wochen erneut in der startelf zu stehen
9358554 blogday was created with the belief that bloggers should have one day dedicated to getting to know other bloggers from other countries and areas of interest on that day bloggers will recommend other blogs to their blog visitors with the goal in mind on this day every blogger will post a recommendation of 5 new blogs this way all blog readers will find themselves leaping around and discovering new previously unknown blogs
9358555 takes place in a moment of crisis within a family when some of its members know a piece of bad news while the others have yet to hear about it a mother has fallen victim to a stroke on her 60th birthday and it takes her three grown children nora hilde and ola completely by surprise meanwhile the rest of the family cant be reached as they wait for her party to begin sa ka la is not a norwegian phrase its some of the unformed words the mother makes after suffering her stroke

9358563 ive always wanted to do a show like this real old school cabaret almost all of the songs were written over 50 years ago molly has a quality reminiscent of the fierce downtown club singers of the 60s and this material suits her extremely well but there is also something decidedly right now about her and i think audiences will love this show

9358568 la era de los muros ideol gicos deber a haber terminado como muy tarde tras el fin del pacto de varsovia
9358569 whatever they might say there right is on our side
9358570 we are behaving in an absolutely moral way and in the framework of all existing international laws
9358571 and so if any of the european countries wish to serve someone elses foreign interests go ahead we cannot insist otherwise
9358572 no nation can be allowed to exert an energy stranglehold over europe
9358573 sleepwalking into an energy dependence on less stable or reliable partners
9358574 even during the cold war the soviet union consistently fulfilled its contract obligations to supply energy to europe irrespective of political or other circumstances
9358575 when russia has a grievance over an issue such as south ossetia it should act multilaterally by consent rather than unilaterally by force
9358576 my message to russia is simple if you want to be welcome at the top table of organizations such as the g8 oecd and wto you must accept that with rights come responsibilities
9358577 that is why i will argue tomorrow at the eu summit that russia should accept georgias territorial integrity and international mechanisms for addressing these conflicts and withdraw troops to their previous positions
9358578 and in the light of russian actions the eu should review root and branch our relationship with russia
9358579 re evaluate the alliances relationship with russia and intensify our support for georgia and others who may face russian aggression
9358580 preliminary reports say that as the vehicle that yevloev and the police officers were in was moving one of the police officers guns accidentally went off and a bullet hit yevloev in the head

9358582 not accept a world order where all decisions are made by one side even such a powerful one as the u s
9358583 we will develop in as much as is possible friendly ties with europe the u s and other countries in the world
9358584 we are holding talks with russias minister for transport we would like to start work in the near future in the next month
9358585 der fu ball ist sehr sehr wichtig f r mich aber die familie und gesundheit gehen jetzt erst mal vor ich m chte zun chst die weiteren tests in den n chsten tagen abwarten
9358586 ich gehe davon aus dass auch diese ein positives ergebnis bringen
9358587 wir hatten gro e angst es war ein gro es zittern f r die ganze familie und unter dieser voraussetzung k nnen wir ihm nicht mehr erlauben fu ball zu spielen
9358588 mit der angst kann ich nicht leben wenn ich nach jedem spiel zittern muss ob er nach hause kommt
9358589 ich habe mit dem 1 fc k ln noch gro es vor
9358590 es war echt hart ich verstehe die entscheidung bis heute nicht das habe ich ihm auch gesagt
9358591 klar ist die wm anfang n chsten jahres in kroatien ein ziel
9358592 das hat gut getan und ich hoffe dass ich die form halten kann
9358593 langsam kann ich es nicht mehr h ren es nervt auch andere teams haben potenzial und ich habe noch nie geh rt dass ein verein dadurch titel gewinnt es gewinnt die mannschaft mit dem besten teamgeist
9358594 klar k nnen wir noch nicht eingespielt sein aber einige fehler d rfen trotzdem nicht passieren
9358595 das war total entt uschend von uns die vorbereitung darf kein alibi sein das problem haben andere auch
9358596 es ist doch gut zu sehen dass die jungs ohne training nicht einfach losspielen k nnen da brauchen sie schon meine hilfe
9358597 an diese h rte und diese schnelligkeit muss ich mich erst einmal gew hnen
9358598 j rgen klopp motiviert uns au erdem verstehen wir uns auch au erhalb des platzes sehr gut
9358599 es ist vielen zweitliga verteidigern nicht gelungen auch in der bundesliga tore zu machen zu ihnen wollte ich nicht geh ren
9358600 neben der kappe hat einen fehlpass nach dem anderen gespielt
9358601 ich w rde f r keinen die hand ins feuer legen
9358602 er suchte sich spieler die aus dem ausland gekommen waren m glichst aus afrika und ohne ihre familien ohne bindung zu den vereinen bei denen sie gerade ihr geld verdienten
9358603 das war in spielerkreisen nie ein thema ich kann mich an keinerlei auff lligkeiten erinnern
9358604 diese vorw rfe sind absolut haltlos ich war immer ein honoriger mann und ich liebe den fu ball ich hatte mit so etwas noch nie zu tun
9358605 es handelt sich um eine anfangsvermutung die aber ernst genommen werden muss es muss eine umfassende aufkl rung stattfinden sollte sich der verdacht best tigen w re das f r den fu ball eine katastrophe
9358606 die ganze geschichte ist absolut l cherlich ich halte das f r pervers
9358607 unser fr hwarnsystem sportradar soll die beiden fraglichen begegnungen noch einmal analysieren und auf auff lligkeiten pr fen der dfb kontrollausschuss wird nach auswertung des materials entscheiden ob er ermittelt wir werden mit sicherheit nichts unter den teppich kehren
9358608 ich war bei der wm t glich mit der mannschaft zusammen und habe nichts von irgendwelchen absprachen mitbekommen
9358609 die art und weise wie wir aufgetreten sind ist schlimmer als die verlorenen drei punkte
9358610 f r den erfolg muss jede mannschaft hart arbeiten egal ob manchester united oder real madrid das haben wir nicht getan wir haben nicht die richtige einstellung gefunden
9358611 gladbach spielte energisch kampfbetont aggressiv und einsatzfreudig diese dinge haben uns gefehlt
9358612 das war ein schei spiel wir haben einfach gro en mist gespielt und sind zu sp t aufgewacht
9358613 das war f r unsere anspr che viel zu wenig
9358614 keiner darf von uns glauben dass es nach der r ckkehr von diego alles von ganz alleine l uft
9358615 zwei punkte aus drei spielen sind sicherlich zu wenig da werden wir ausgiebig dr ber reden m ssen f r die spieler wird es unruhig werden
9358616 wir haben gro en mist gespielt sind zu sp t aufgewacht
9358617 the aircraft was in my judgment never airworthy from the first release to service in 1969

9358647 abbiamo fatto una straordinaria partita mi complimento con i nostri giocatori e con il tecnico ho visto bellissimi gol devo dire che andata meglio del previsto siamo addirittura frastornati da questa vittoria e per quanto mi riguarda essendo la mia ultima partita da presidente non poteva esserci migliore uscita
9358648 di vaio stato subito protagonista in coppa italia entrato e ha fatto gol e oggi ha fatto una grande partita come valiani e tutti gli altri dice il presidente uscente del bologna ai microfoni di sky sport valiani ha dimostrato che in b e in a ci pu stare una scommessa vinta in qualche modo sono molto soddisfatto avevo la missione di riportare il bologna in a abbiamo anche fatto un buon esordio e per me un risultato inaspettato
9358649 pesantemente criticato la nostra squadra una bella risposta un bellinizio per un campionato che deve essere sempre incentrato sulla salvezza
9358650 it is mutually agreed that the club shall have the right to assign or to loan this spc and the player agrees to accept and be bound by such assignment or loan and will faithfully perform and carry out this spc with the same purpose and effect as if it had been entered into by the player and such other club

9358653 unfortunately because of the economy those projects are in a holding pattern right now until the next fiscal year
9358654 its unfortunate but whatever has been deemed a lower priority in this case this project has is waiting until we reassess them
9358655 it might not be right on oct 1 but sometime in october
9358656 ive heard absolutely nothing about it since they usps officials came to see me late last year
9358657 they had the money but i havent heard anything since
9358658 where the po boxes are now the elevation is very unsafe
9358659 its dangerous for pushing and pulling mail to and from the p o boxes
9358660 what i like about this team is that it is fun
9358661 on some teams its always about win win win here we have a really good time
9358662 new schedules can be a little tough because weve never seen those teams before
9358663 when you see teams again and again you get to know their style a little bit and its tough when you cant do that
9358664 im tall so i really like to play at the net
9358665 tennis is one of my favorite sports so i look forward to pretty much every match we have
9358666 i think im good at staying in pretty good condition i like to charge the net and play pretty aggressively in singles but you cant really do that in doubles
9358667 ive improved a whole bunch i rarely played before i got to high school and i think my play has grown by leaps and bounds
9358668 im especially proud of how much better my serves got from when i started
9358669 i actually think one of the worst aspects of my game is my forehand but i just really like my backhand im not sure why
9358670 i really want to work every day at tennis though because its my favorite sport
9358671 that was one of the main reasons we agreed to do the show it was going very slow
9358672 we got more done in that one month than in a year piddling around
9358673 i had to have all the data in mind as i put on my tv personality exaggerating gestures and really hitting home the pluses and minuses of each home
9358674 it was actually great the crew was so nice to work with and they were really accommodating
9358675 i did a lot of research before i was accepted onto the show they really wanted hard numbers they didnt just want fluff
9358676 we are looking for real estate experts who have a strong presence and knowledge of their market
9358677 they should be confident judging homes and letting homeowners know the expected return on investment on top of that they have to have good communication skills and lots of energy
9358678 we never plan on moving again we love our house our lot our neighborhood and we love tahoe
9358679 afterward mountain course head golf professional angie rodriguez came to me and asked for my card and told me i broke the record
9358680 ive never broken a record before at any course so it felt really good
9358681 it was a great round just a perfect game of golf katelyns just in a class by herself
9358682 not only is katelyn a great player shes obviously one of the best in the state but shes always very concerned about the team
9358683 gwen played extremely well and she was very good off the tee
9358684 what gwen michaela and sarena suffered from was the short game were going to focus this week on chipping and putting around the green and on the green is where were going to pick up strokes
9358685 after two years we definitely got it up and running
9358686 it would be good to have a change to have some different results
9358687 i think i realized what i was dreaming about it gives me a great sense of pride
9358688 my passion for it doesnt make it difficult to go out and ask for money
9358689 i was hoping we could double what we did the first year
9358690 a season will always be a challenge after losing that number of starters from the last year
9358691 but one of the benefits of starting out with girls on the ground floor is that we get to work on the fundamentals every day for the next six weeks
9358692 our team isnt all young weve got junior mady paul and senior rebecca corpuel who both have a good year of experience as starters and know how to play
9358693 but most of the girls we have are starting from scratch many of them have had no lessons so this season theyll have to just work on getting proper technique and in tennis because it is so technical that can take awhile
9358694 we met our goal of getting a big enough team so we wouldnt have to forfeit any matches
9358695 rebecca has taken over that leadership role it does help to have that as a coach
9358696 i guess it was planned that when the seniors left id be the leader its kind of expected and known that if youre a senior on the team youre a leader
9358697 but teammates mady and junior dana nelson have also turned into leaders
9358698 i think my mental toughness is what i need to work on
9358699 i think last year it was tough not to get too angry i just need to relax a little bit
9358700 i just want to have fun and help the team learn i wont be too bummed if we dont do great this year
9358701 parsons was a great coach and were just getting to know coach groff now but i think they generally coached the same things
9358702 i think the teams im looking forward to playing the most would be galena because they pretty much play year round and always beat us
9358703 we always do horrible against them so it would be great to get a win against them
9358704 my dad ran the donald reynolds newspaper group and our family spent vacations here starting in the 60s
9358705 the first place our family owned was at mountain shadows in the early 80s
9358706 in 1993 i bought this practice and moved up here
9358707 i had friends here that asked me to play on their softball team
9358708 i make an effort to be a positive role model for the kids
9358709 i have been coaching for six or seven years now and last year i took over the presidency
9358710 i became involved in the community because i want to do what i can to make it better
9358711 the hospital is such a valuable resource and one thing that serves everyone
9358712 we are fortunate to have a hospital in this size community
9358713 rotary does good things for our community as well as people all over the world
9358714 i have been in star follies for a few years
9358715 it is a lot of work compressed into a short period and an important activity that i enjoy doing
9358716 no matter how much our message is ignored or ridiculed as was done in the campaign no matter how much they did to us it only energized our grass roots
9358717 our focus is really on this side of the river
9358718 we think theres enough excitement and energy on this side
9358719 we only want to cause noise in the sense of letting people know there are other movements out there that other people believe in
9358720 i feel as one person who stands up i have a voice and letting it be heard sends fear to the establishment
9358721 i really didnt envision how many tackles i would have or anything like that
9358722 i just envisioned playing good football and having fun and it really worked out well for me
9358723 we made a lot of mistakes tonight we just need to get to the film and see what we messed up on and get ready for next week
9358724 everybody needs to keep talking and make sure were on the same page the fans were getting loud and we just need to hit the calls better
9358725 we had some communication problems and we missed some assignments
9358726 i dont want to take anything away from western michigan but most of what they got is what we gave them thats good and bad we got to get them coached up a little better
9358727 i came in and halftime and gave him a hard time about dropping a pick
9358728 but no he looked really good out there hes a playmaker for this defense its great to see him coming on that quick im kind of sad to see him leave but im glad hes there with the defense
9358729 la tribuna antimperialista para los que pensamos como pienso yo es la consagraci n que soy antimperislista por excelencia no lo proclamo no lo digo a diario y no lo grito pero mi esencia es absolutamente antimperialista y revolucionaria
9358730 cuando invito a mis amigos a que hagan lo que quieran con toda libertad que canten sus canciones que cantemos juntos mis canciones y que hagamos un recorrido por toda mi obra y que todo eso lo reciba el p blico joven cubano como despedida de este verano 2008 es absolutamente simb lico para m por eso este recital ha significado tanto por estar aqu en este lugar que significa tanto para el pueblo cubano y para m en especial
9358731 im ersten drittel haben es uns die f chse die hier sehr engagiert aufgetreten sind sehr schwer gemacht jean marc pelletier hat uns in dieser phase im spiel gehalten im weiteren verlauf sind wir aber besser in fahrt gekommen und haben verdient das spiel gewonnen
9358732 nat rlich wollen wir auch dort gewinnen und ins viertelfinale einziehen
9358733 i know the sikh family very well theyre family friends to hear that their little girl saishaa who is just 2 has cancer just shook me to the core the family wanted me to ask sanjay dutt for help from the charitable institution nargis dutt foundation thats named after his mother since i know sanjay i readily agreed and rang him up
9358734 when he heard the seriousness of the situation he said forget the foundation ill help the girl and he immediately agreed to write out a large sum of money for little saishaas treatment at the tata memorial hospital
9358735 shes a great lady it is a very bold ticket that will give democrats a run for their money in november
9358736 of course id love to ive known john mccain for 15 years hes a friend and i support him
9358737 it was a lifetime experience to work with such a senior actress like padmini kolhapure the inputs from her helped me a lot to improve my performance
9358738 it is a film on child adoption where i play the lead role in the film padmini and ayub khan are advised by their friend to adopt a kid but they are against the idea at that point i come into the picture and help them to understand the idea of adoption they finally adopt a daughter
9358739 im no more interested in television and have completely left it as i want to concentrate on films
9358740 but it was my close up ad with big smile that got me the film director viju mane saw my close up ad and got in touch with me and offered me the role
9358741 its just slow for people to realize its a real illness
9358742 i didnt have anybody to sign or advocate for me
9358743 im labeled like you should get it or you should have known better so snap out of it
9358744 id like people to know were real and were not different from you or anybody else in the world
9358745 were equal and we have a right to be here and not be stigmatized
9358746 melissa dont let your mouth overload your hardware sit tight and serve your community fairly the real diarrhea is the way you want that committee to be more than what it is settle down and do your civic duty and maybe later you can serve on a board with real teeth that makes real changes for brownsville
9358747 cheap sandal that doubles as a disciplinary device in latino households
9358748 tees available from many a web site what latino kid or any other for that matter in s a hasnt been disciplined with one of mommas
9358749 the thong between your toes it draws your attention to that area
9358750 he was just walking and officers noticed him stopped him and questioned him as to who he was said biron
9358751 once you get the knack of pressing two buttons at the same time its as if youre bowling
9358752 i honestly think moreso the driving force behind this is what people see on tv and what they experience with their families
9358753 people who know their grandkids are using this they seem to be very intrigued and want to compete on an even playing field this way they can do it with their peers then take it back home and show em how its done
9358754 we do not have one yet but we desperately want one
9358755 i have heard of other councils on aging that have leagues
9358756 i think it would be a lot of fun if its part of a balanced program of activity i can see where it would be beneficial in some ways
9358757 every time we find out we run out to buy it but we dont have the budget for it
9358758 two years ago we had people bowling in our main room and we had bocce outside but for some people it was too physical i think the wii is going to be a catalyst for perhaps participating more in physical activity more social activity and i think its going to be good for the memory
9358759 we would like one but its just one of those things that just has to kind of come our way we dont have the budget for it
9358760 it would be something people could do at any time it would not need a special class
9358761 its not something seniors are apt to have in their homes i think the senior center is a good place for one
9358762 from everybody ive talked to theyre a lot of fun
9358763 a lot of rehabilitation places are using them to increase range of motion
9358764 i love it were having fun its really fun its wonderful
9358765 i think everybody is looking forward to the start of the regular season
9358766 thats always the way it is you have a lot of practices you have four games now we get ready to play the regular schedule were excited about that
9358767 if its just a laundry list of special interest groups trying to curry favor with the incumbent because they think the incumbent is going to win then i dont think theyre particularly helpful
9358768 in the end i didnt see any compelling reasons to have her replaced of course shes not former state rep debby blumer but things take time
9358769 i am confident that the residents of framingham will not let the opinions of a few people influence their decision on whom to vote for everyone is entitled to their own opinion
9358770 i have been pleased humbled and even occasionally surprised by the breadth of support i have received in the community a cross section of community leaders and activists like laura medrano l j carroll bob berman and sidney pires to name just a few are with me too
9358771 i think there are places in the commonwealth that could really use this casino
9358772 to explore the american perceptions of what vietnam means and what images it conjures up
9358773 vietnam was always abstract to me as it is to the american people
9358774 i went to vietnam to really figure out what this word vietnam means to me
9358775 many exhibits in the u s try to capture something about vietnam with a capital letter v that overwhelms viewers
9358776 exhibits like that dont correspond to reality they show some imaginary vietnam left over from movies
9358777 i chose 10 artists for the exhibit because i wanted it to include a variety of media including painting photography and video i felt each woman artist represented some aspect of vietnamese women in vietnam each has their own personal story yet each comes from a different background
9358778 i liked this exhibit because it focuses on recent art produced in the past decade which has been a time of tremendous change that provided women with new opportunities and new challenges
9358779 presenting visions of contemporary vietnamese society that departs from the expectations many americans have about a war torn society
9358780 just open your eyes look and have your own intuitive response
9358781 theres no war in this art its not about politics
9358782 these are individual women who have no blanket statement to make or overall message to give theyre artists and their works are what they have to say
9358783 french hill is one community but obviously you have people from a lot of different backgrounds
9358784 the fair is a chance to expose everyone to a different culture
9358785 speaking with police chief mark leonard and some of the other officers they said one of the biggest things is that a lot of crimes are unreported
9358786 thats for every bad word he ever said about french hill
9358787 i went down the stairs and i couldnt see anything
9358788 its really bad the whole thing is black you cant see anything
9358789 right now its just hard for the tigers to accept this loss
9358790 its a situation where i think the teams pretty close
9358791 were going to suck it up let it sink in were going to get right back to work thats part of us coaches and adults and the people who are around these kids to be positive role models in their support group its our job to teach them how to handle situations and keep fighting and thats what well do
9358792 sometimes the ball bounces your way sometimes it doesnt we just have to get back to work sunday and monday and prepare to play
9358793 i dont feel good about what happened with the clock at the end of the game
9358794 i felt like we should have been playing for overtime im man enough to admit it
9358795 catch hit fumble they said he had possession of the ball
9358796 it kept drives alive and we converted on third down in a big way anytime you can do that against a great football team thats big
9358797 they were really blitzing us hard and we just started locking our guys on and running some zone iso pretty much try to get hat on hat and try to get j t to be a great athlete i thought he ran extremely hard
9358798 i understand youre having a rough time lets work together to deal with this
9358799 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
9358800 the leader of the new school of old school r amp b
9358801 we set a goal two and a half years ago to impact the world with ros brand of timeless music and now it looks like weve finally made a huge leap forward to seeing that happen
9358802 i have had the belief factor in ro since day one and now i have that same belief in go large records so now there should be nothing stopping us
9358803 ro is definitely a trendsetter within the r amp b industry and has the aptitude to hang with icon trendsetters like usher john legend and alicia keys
9358804 yakima county commissioner mike leita said hes tired of the yakima valley taking a back seat to the tri cities where talk of a similar venue has floated in recent years adding to a loud round of applause its time we stepped up and take the lead
9358805 i dont think i would ever move by myself just to make more money
9358806 that there will be a critical personnel shortage is known
9358807 i would never say we have the staffing dilemma fixed
9358808 but we are in a much better position in this community
9358809 the shortage here is more moderate but its still present
9358810 the marketplace has a way so huge deficiencies in a particular job category dont really come about
9358811 thats what were going to see in the next 10 to 15 years
9358812 those continue to just be huge needs for the community
9358813 i dont know that were closer to solving that issue
9358814 weve heard that the need is less intensified people usually continue to nod and say yep were headed in the right direction
9358815 the three hospitals have worked very cooperatively and have been very cordial all three hospitals are doing more than other hospitals in the country to address staffing
9358816 great site great service i started submitting my press releases through mediasyndicate com over four years ago and never looked back the site has always delivered reliable and consistent results for my clients
9358817 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
9358818 we are very pleased with summer 2008 and now more than ever it so important for a pr firm to drive results not talk
9358819 even in a tough economy corporate america isnt shutting down and companies across the globe are even more focused on securing high impact cost effective marketing programs we believe the 5w style pr is the real key to any successful awareness campaign
9358820 aggressive in a way that clearly resonates with clients looking for a firm staffed with type a plus personalities a bs free approach and results from day one
9358821 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
9358822 its a great opportunity for law enforcement officers and their families from across the region to socialize and play softball
9358823 ive been approached by officers from many different agencies expressing their support for the latschar family and officer latschar wanting to know what they can do to help
9358824 ive got a few friends who are police officers and one was shot so i thought it would be a good idea to donate something to help raise some money
9358825 we received 20 tapes and the santa clarita dodger day committee then chose their top 4 we sent those tapes to the dodgers and they chose the winner lindsay hough
9358826 unsensibel den parteitag abzuhalten wenn menschen an der golfk ste leiden
9358827 das ist mehr als wir im gesamten vierten quartal 2007 gesammelt haben
9358828 nahezu unbemerkt hat sich das gift vom faltenkiller zum allzweckmedikament gemausert
9358829 the fans are great and its just a fantastic experience the stadium is just an awesome place to be during the game
9358830 what do we not need weve got flags weve got welcome signs and doormats
9358831 football season is what makes our business roll and its a fun and electric time of year
9358832 we want our volunteers with the mobile feeding units we want them in place working very closely with fema and the offices of emergency management in those areas just so that were all working together so that the communication is flowing so that we dont have another katrina situation
9358833 so when the man comes back home he wants to see how much women loves them they look to the bottles if its full with tears they know the women in love with them but if its empty its not a good sign
9358834 putting it in the right position of your bedroom right it creates special feeling in you that you project out to attract the right soul mate
9358835 it is a tradition its a family event and its a place where you go and youre gonna make a lot of friends and have a lot of fun
9358836 even if you dont know anything about tractors its just fascinating i wish i would have brought my kids they would have loved it
9358837 what do you think of vi i see little change may we not speak of the old days and what came after
9358838 das interessiert mich wirklich es kommen immer mehr tolle filme aus europa und anderen kulturen
9358839 wenn ich es richtig kann spreche ich vielleicht in ein paar jahren f r einen franz sischen film vor
9358840 if id known what the eurovision was going to bring i wouldnt have gone not in a million years it wasnt worth the hassle afterwards i went over thinking it was great i was only 17 years old and i had the world at my feet and i thought nothing could go wrong but boy was i wrong
9358841 ive had people spit on me id be walking by and theyd spit on my shoe or on the ground beside me and id have to kind of hold myself up my friends were very loyal and they used to end up in fights trying to protect me from physical and verbal abuse i was broken broken inside
9358842 it was quite tough especially on my family it got very personal i would literally be walking down the street in my home town afterwards and people would be roaring nasty things out the window
9358843 theyd be saying oh theres that pair from the eurovision they disgraced the country and it was constant there used to be times when i used to go out and say if i didnt do that bloody contest i could just go up the town and get drunk and go home but it didnt happen that way
9358844 i can think of a few low points but i dont want to go into it right now its something im trying to forget
9358845 they observed the two males on the motorcycle but theyre driving the wrong way so theyre stopped and the witness identifies them the complaintant comes down and identifies his products and theyre arrested for burglary

9358847 was die gesamtzahl betrifft da gibt es starke j hrliche schwankungen
9358848 wenn man aber aufschl sselt nach schwachen und starken hurrikans dann ist im laufe der jahre ein dramatischer anstieg bei den hurrikans der h chsten kategorien vier und f nf zu beobachten
9358849 je h her die wassertemperaturen umso besser sind die voraussetzungen f r kr ftige wirbelst rme
9358850 das ist anders als bei den sturm und orkantiefs in unseren breiten die sich im herbst oder winter bilden
9358851 sie leben von der temperaturdifferenz zwischen subtropen und polarregionen aus diesem unterschied nehmen sie ihre energie
9358852 die zahl der wirbelst rme ist von jahr zu jahr sehr verschieden
9358853 so war es nach einem extrem heftigen jahr 2005 unter anderem mit
9358854 die einen glauben dass es bis 2050 nicht mehr hurrikans als bisher auch geben wird andere rechnen mit einer zunahme von f nf bis zehn prozent
9358855 ich kann mir vorstellen dass man bei den preisen f r gespr che noch weiter runtergeht

9358866 was die zeitzonen angeht ist jetzt der gazastreifen vom westjordanland so weit entfernt wie saudi arabien von marokko
9358867 its indicative of a much larger problem and that the health care crisis in hawaii and the nation for that matter and health care costs are skyrocketing and these problems and i have to emphasize are politically induced
9358868 those costs are being passed on to consumers and passed on to doctors and incredibly high insurance rates you know when you pay 30 40 50 thousand dollars a year for medical malpractice insurance ultimately you got to get that money from the poor patient
9358869 what we are seeing now is the beginning we are peeling back the layers really seeing the healthcare crisis as it is and its not going to get better
9358870 theres no reason for the legislators to sit back and do nothing and the governor too we need to work together it shouldnt have to be a party thing it should be all of us working together to find solutions
9358871 in 2009 the top issue will be healthcare and we have to address it
9358872 im sure theres going to be tons of people on the lake its a beautiful day to get together with a bunch of friends the whole weekend actually
9358873 its kind of the last weekend for families to come out and go camping together
9358874 some people go to bed at 10 00 pm some people are up until 2 3 00 in the morning
9358875 but youve got to make sure one person is able to drive the boat
9358876 its just probably better not to drink while im boating and just save it for when i get back
9358877 ya go in ya look around and everythings just the same its good
9358878 this was back in war no one remembers the korean war so i like to remind people of the action the missouri had
9358879 they did begin to fire they were getting very close there were splashes right beside the ship and shrapnel landing beside the deck captain edsel very sadly dropped dead of a heart attack right on the controls of the ship
9358880 the pride of the ship goes on almost 60 years since i served on it and i still find myself daily thinking about different things on the ship

9358886 the fast turnaround and extra attention they paid to my submissions was well worth the money
9358887 k ngp ns market consists largely of early adopters and tech savy individuals this presents a real opportunity to take advantage of new web technologies that we otherwise would shy away from

9358890 there are many issues for m ori in relation to dealing with hair hair is regarded as tapu or sacred and the head is an important and significant part of the body considerations include where you place it what you hold it in and how you dispose of it
9358891 hair is a potent material im interested and inspired by the way the work is received people feel uncomfortable
9358892 while they did not initially understand they realise that i am using hair in my work to challenge my own tikanga art should challenge boundaries
9358893 i have put my own hair out there in a public place and gifted pieces to people my hair is going into another persons space i no longer have control over where it is placed
9358894 some people consider it to be an ineffable or taboo topic im interested in how doctors consider hair from a scientific approach as a code for an individuals dna and researched the ideas about hair from m ori and p keha cultures in new zealand

9358900 i let my wife help me pick out some shoes every year
9358901 i always wear open toed not large heeled shoes because i understand what a lady goes through by walking that mile in those shoes
9358902 i rolled my ankle a few times but its all in the name of a good cause
9358903 a lot of men get the negative attention for the 2 percent that are doing the evil in this community and i believe that this type of event is an opportunity to tell out community that there are 98 percent of other men that are not doing these things
9358904 so if youre out here youre actually showing that you do care
9358905 we have to challenge people to be a part of the change stand up for the rights of women and to tell them that the men out there really care and that we honor and respect women and we got to stop the violence
9358906 my mission is thinking about the people that are going to be there who wanted to get out but for some reason cant
9358907 were there to comfort them and lead them in the direction of knowing that its going to be ok
9358908 we think this football program is going to be another light that shines for campbell university
9358909 it helps shed light on many of our other programs that are so outstanding
9358910 i know all the coaches from all the other campbell sports do a great job with their teams
9358911 and i dont expect campbell football to be any different
9358912 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9358913 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9358914 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9358915 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9358916 it seems to us that over here theres a really good flow of traffic that comes through and were still in the hub the heart of the fair
9358917 the crowd is really picking up now but in the early part of the fair until people found out where we were we had a lot of complaints about them not being able to find us
9358918 so far it seems like its better than last year yeah were really happy
9358919 no our bottom line is hurting definitely because people are not finding the other tent so we have double the expenses splitting the two booths up like that but were not getting the business we should at the second tent
9358920 the bottom line is going to flex cause without the 32 ounce or the 22 ounce cup were not going through as much volume so were not doing the numbers we would normally do
9358921 but ultimately i think its just going to take a couple years i mean this isnt the first time weve got moved and it certainly not going to be the last
9358922 if they can get a man whos committed to someone else they take it as a win

9358926 im proud of our girls for battling for the full 90 minutes to come out with a win against a good northwestern team last night but were going to have to play with greater intensity and focus on monday if we hope to get a good result
9358927 loyola is a team with ncaa tournament experience and im sure will be more than ready to play

9358935 full color maps of both the u s and mexico along with bilingual vocal prompts and menus make traveling in either country whether a citizen or visitor more convenient safer and less stressful
9358936 while it is difficult to clearly predict where the storm will make landfall we decided to announce our closure now so students faculty and staff wont have to wait to make plans
9358937 that puts a different light on our evacuations and hopefully that will send a very clear message to the people in the gulf coast to really pay attention
9358938 going someplace you dont know people you dont know and then when you come back is your house going to be ok

9358951 probbaly got over one hundred fifty people here or so its our first time doing football season so were getting pretty slammed
9358952 its kind of tough to see them getting their butt kicked like this oh well its ok ive been through the oh 12 season so this cant be any worse than that
9358953 i tink theyve got some issues with their special teams and theyre not tackling
9358954 i think they should have brought in graunke graunke would have been the man
9358955 i know he cant make the grade but he can make the plays
9358956 this is uh football this is hawaii we should be proud of them
9358957 just to spend time with friends and family and support your home team that just says something about your state
9358958 this game sounds very unsavoury i hope the british board of film classification bbfc will view this with concern and decide it should not be granted a classification without that it cannot be marketed in britain what the rest of world does is up to them we need to ensure that modern and civilized values take priority rather than killing and maiming people it seems a shame that the games manufacturer have decided to exclusively release this game on the wii i believe it will spoil the family fun image of the wii
9358959 madworld pushes the envelope with its extreme content but takes a step away from the dark and serious nature of most mature games
9358960 wii appeals to a wide range of audiences from children and teenagers to adult and senior citizens anyone from 5 95 as such there is a wide range of content for all ages and tastes available

9358971 he believes its totally unacceptable to put california on this roller coaster ride year after year after year
9358972 its like that team that lost you know 82 games in a row its not the kind of record you want to talk about
9358973 this kind of madness every time there is an economic slowdown
9358974 ive been sent to sacramento by the people of california to fix problems permanently not just for one year and then to kick that can down the road
9358975 at this late date 67 days before the election any more changes would seriously jeopardize the integrity of the election
9358976 if the governor and lawmakers want to spend millions more they do have that power
9358977 were on a hope and prayer they dont put any additional measures on the ballot
9358978 at this point weve got the ballot ready to go

9358986 its extremely exciting this is a chance for me to connect directly and for my staff to connect directly with our listeners that weve never had before and were really looking forward to doing that
9358987 we had to upgrade our existing transmitter that involved adding a second transmitter we also had other upgrades that included our studio transmitter link
9358988 on an hd receiver youll hear things that you havent been able to hear before because the frequency response has been limited to 15 kilohertz at the top end
9358989 hd radio i would say is in its infancy the technology is still being developed if the wrvo signal travels say 30 miles in a direction the hd signal may not reach that 30 miles
9358990 looters will go directly to jail you will not get a pass this time
9358991 you will not have a temporary stay in the city you will go directly to the big house
9358992 i was worried about the kids we just couldnt stay
9358993 gustav is a large system similar to katrina the difference at this moment is that its asymmetric it doesnt have a uniform coverage like katrina
9358994 the army corps of engineers informs me that while the levees are stronger than theyve ever been people across the gulf coast especially in new orleans need to understand that in a storm of this size there are serious risks of significant flooding
9358995 my message to the people of the gulf coast is this storm is dangerous
9358996 i sent my son out with a camera and said go take pictures of our backyard
9358997 a similar cold front caused a major dust event on monday the rest of the event has been relatively dust free
9358998 overall the event is going smoothly with no major problems
9358999 medical cases are very consistent with last year with daily patient loads of 0 5 to 0 7 per cent of the population
9359000 the sea is something that is so very complicated i just thought it would be great to draw it by crayon
9359001 i think animation at times needs the pencil and needs mans drawing hand
9359002 i am 67 years old when i do my next work ill be more than 70 so i probably will have to have help from the younger generation
9359003 that sounds like what it was a cry for help from a hostage hours later the police finally obtained a search warrant for the wrong house one adjacent to the house where they were being detained and nonetheless broke in pointing guns forced them to lay on the floor and handcuffed everyone inside and handcuffed a national lawyers guild attorney outside they searched the house arrested nobody and then left
9359004 the crux is that this is the man who said the report was so private that it cant be given to hlaudi and yet when it suited him he pretended to be a knight in shining armour
9359005 the excitement is because we have a quality opponent in mississippi state its on national television and its the season opener these are the types of games we want to be in as a program how we will fair we will find out
9359006 they are going to come out and get in the i formation and see if were man enough to stop them
9359007 theyll take shots down field we cant go to sleep and give up big plays we have to do a great job of tackling its going to be a big challenge for us we have to match their toughness
9359008 in their eight wins last year i think they held their opponents to 17 points or less and were talking about them playing some good offenses itll be a challenge for us to find a way to score
9359009 the game is finally here and its game week i felt like it would never get here im just ready to play a game opening day is opening day you wait more than 200 days for it to get here you just want to go out and play your best game you want to do the little things right and not get ahead of yourself i think we are all focused and excited
9359010 we look at last year and i was very disappointed in how we competed against the three bcs programs and i take full responsibility for that and i told the team that
9359011 over the last 12 time weve played in these types of games we havent performed very well thats a fact however we also wont be held hostage to the past
9359012 these are the types of games we need to play and our programs needs to embrace and enjoy it allows you to see where you are as a program we just need to play better in these games
9359013 we faced so much adversity with turnovers in the red zones it was something we had talked about all week but they kept fighting kept believing and they grinded out a victory
9359014 this team had a lot of confidence in themselves i had a lot of confidence in them for this game mississippi state is a good looking squad it was tough we kept coming back kept swinging and good things started happening
9359015 coach has talked to me a lot about kicking with confidence be calm and relax
9359016 this has been a long process ive been here 5 years and ive been waiting for this moment for a long time my patience paid off
9359017 it was an old fashioned drive we stayed patient with the run the backs ran hard and we had a couple of third and firsts
9359018 here we are at the last three minutes to go in the game
9359019 it doesnt matter what happens this is the hand you are dealt go out and make a big play
9359020 these guys are in the sec this is good defense
9359021 it was taylors first game he had one bad play that interception he wasnt as accurate as he needed to be
9359022 you cant get too excited even though were going to celebrate this win i always preach consistency one game doesnt make a team good programs go week to week
9359023 they are a very good team and they are very comfortable on their home court there were flashes and point runs where we played well unfortunately we were too inconsistent which is expected because of the amount of newcomers we have game two was probably our best effort tonight it showed our most complete volleyball performance hopefully we will continue to do the things we do well and improve upon the areas we need to improve upon
9359024 are businesses still buying it looks like the answer is yes
9359025 strong effort against a powerhouse our kids were big underdogs you look at their banners conference titles ncaa tournament appearances you look at all that and we put up a great fight
9359026 it came down to us making two mistakes and we got punished for it they made two mistakes and we punished them once at this level thats the difference
9359027 we took great heart because this is a huge improvement over last year
9359028 this time last year we would have lost this game 10 0 on the road all these things against us im very proud of the way we played
9359029 but this bodes well for the season our kids played great our seniors put in a great effort and set a very good example for our freshmen we crossed a big bridge tonight
9359030 checking in and getting ready to go through this again with him
9359031 this is probably the case with almost any emergency which is as soon as you make contact with the enemy the plan starts to suffer some alterations
9359032 going to be in some ways more challenging than katrina
9359033 will test parts of the levee that were not tested during katrina
9359034 the government has taken over all boats in the area
9359035 the situation is definitely bad but now the army has joined in and rescue operations will be speeded up
9359036 people have been trapped for days living on the roofs of the concrete buildings in the villages while mud and thatch huts were swept away
9359037 sanctions are being considered and many other means as well
9359038 we are trying to elaborate a strong text that will show our determination not to accept what is happening in georgia
9359039 i dont want to talk about sanctions myself ahead of time when the meeting itself has not taken place but we are working with our 26 partners at this moment
9359040 not afraid of anything including the prospect of a cold war
9359041 the russian president says he is not afraid of a new cold war
9359042 we dont want one he has a big responsibility not to start one
9359043 we are in a situation which marks a clear end to the relative and growing calm in and around europe since the collapse of the soviet union
9359044 the current crisis in the caucasus does not mark the return of the cold war nor is it likely to mark the start of open warfare between russia and the west
9359045 it is more simply the return of the traditional imperialism practiced by the russian empire more than a century ago
9359046 russia knows that when it comes to conducting a serious foreign and security policy europe is all mouth
9359047 i doubt whether anything tougher than strongly worded communiques will ever be employed
9359048 among our partners there are indeed some who apparently are not so clear about the fact that anyone who goes out through a door must know how to get back in
9359049 once russia sees it has reached none of its strategic goals
9359050 russia will be forced to step back revisit its position and come to a more rational approach to georgia
9359051 may be the next focus of political pressure for russia whose doctrine of the near abroad harks back to the sphere of interest policy of the past
9359052 what has happened in georgia continuing like nothing has happened is a mistake under these circumstances we cannot have business as usual
9359053 eu enlargement was a good idea before the war in georgia and the conflict has only underlined its importance
9359054 russias commitment to a relationship of understanding and cooperation with the rest of europe is in doubt
9359055 its up to russia today to make a fundamental choice
9359056 to assume a presence on the ground in support of all efforts toward a peaceful and lasting solution to conflicts in georgia
9359057 russia may pretend with its petro power and wealth to be immune from any actions by the west but beyond the short term it is vulnerable
9359058 i think were all a little bit anxious about this storm simply because of the path
9359059 we get ready earlier than we used to years ago
9359060 we feel like its easier to pull back than it is in the last hours to try to move forward
9359061 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9359062 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9359063 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9359064 i the prime minister have come to office in the righteous way and i wont resign
9359065 i will not back down i will rule this country and will lead it through all of the problems
9359066 i understand its maine and all that but the biggest thing for us is not getting too ahead of ourselves this is the first game and its good to make a statement the way we did
9359067 that was the plan coming into today and it may very well be the same way next week
9359068 whatever they have to do to be ready when they go in thats their responsibility until somebody really just grabs onto the thing well just proceed along its like any other position if things are close well try to make a fair evaluation and go from there
9359069 i dont know though i dont think thats the plan but well see what happens
9359070 there was nothing good to say about our kicking game in the spring
9359071 theyre competing hard both of them want to be the guy and i think thats good and i think it has a chance to be a healthy situation which will be great
9359072 hes the only guy on the team who has his socks down around his ankles thats the first thing were going to have to get straightened out with him and i just hope he doesnt think this is easy because today looked easy for him

9359077 were looking forward to letting them get the full experience of kinnick stadium
9359078 that first touchdown that theyll see and hearing kinnick go crazy is just something you cant replace
9359079 he does things the right way and is a man who cares
9359080 im kind of a sports nut so i like watching the athleticism of the players
9359081 theres certain things you cant teach and it looks like hes got a little of that too
9359082 hes been a freshman thats come in and kind of opened some eyes
9359083 you dont really see a freshman be that aggressive you see more tippy toeing but he did a good job
9359084 we felt good about him and the way he has been practicing
9359085 hes not afraid to run tough and hell block tough
9359086 its one step and hes got a lot of games ahead of him
9359087 so what he needs to do is get his feet on the ground and keep them on the ground
9359088 i have no reason to think he wont but he needs to get better during the week just like everybody else
9359089 with all due respect to the recruiting experts maybe we really need to check the ball state early commitment list
9359090 i said to iowa recruiting coordinator eric johnson in the fourth quarter lets go in the office right now and see what theyve got
9359091 the first thing is were going to have to get him to pull his socks up
9359092 he was the only guy out there with his socks down around his ankles
9359093 this is what i came back for to do stuff like this
9359094 i love football football is my life it was a great sigh of relief when i stepped on that field
9359095 i think i made a positive out of it and now im back here
9359096 that meant a lot just to get the jitters out
9359097 first game back first carry and then keep it rolling
9359098 i think ill be much better than that in the games coming up
9359099 hes not i dont think quite full speed yet but his attitude has been great
9359100 hes getting closer and hes been working hard and hes a different kind of runner than weve had so that part is neat and different and exciting
9359101 were looking forward to letting them get the full experience of kinnick stadium
9359102 that first touchdown that theyll see and hearing kinnick go crazy is just something you cant replace
9359103 he does things the right way and is a man who cares
9359104 im kind of a sports nut so i like watching the athleticism of the players
9359105 one thats not good we felt we had good protection most of the ballgame there are areas we need to clean up and blitzes we can pick up that we know we can pick up
9359106 weve been doing the same thing in practice and i think coach has exposed us to sharing pretty well
9359107 we know what were capable of doing its just a matter of going out and doing it
9359108 and its just a matter of pain tolerance and thats tricky as a lineman
9359109 in the second half we ran out of gas and did not play with good strategy
9359110 we had plenty of opportunities we just could not capitalize on them
9359111 our errors are very fixable and we need to keep improving
9359112 i will have been in 352 consecutive football games without missing one except tonight i miss one
9359113 you see old friends and at least have a chance to take in a football game
9359114 id like to believe the worst is behind me i dont know yet
9359115 but i will say this week four was tougher than week five so im a little encouraged i made it through this past week
9359116 the good news is its survivable the bad news is the treatment is really kind of despicable
9359117 cancer attacks your muscle mass anyway so you lose muscle mass and you lose strength you dont have any muscle definition after a few months
9359118 all of my meals are through a feeding tube there is no eating i can drink but i cant eat because its in my throat
9359119 im still the head coach at western illinois but the acting head coach is mark hendrickson
9359120 mark and i talk every day i get messages to the team through mark
9359121 the players are not upset at all because they know the only choice i had was to get treated now or risk dying
9359122 because of these things the wrath of god is coming upon the sons of disobedience
9359123 what is highly esteemed among men is an abomination in the sight of god
9359124 take heed and beware of covetousness for ones life does not consist in the abundance of things he possesses
9359125 no covetous man who is an idolater has any inheritance in the kingdom of christ and god
9359126 let no one deceive you with empty words for because of these things the wrath of god comes upon the sons of disobedience therefore do not be partakers with them
9359127 let your conduct be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have
9359128 having food and clothing with these we shall be content
9359129 but those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in perdition and destruction for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil from which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness and pierced themselves through with many sorrows
9359130 they are men of corrupt minds and desititute of the faith who suppose that godliness is a means of gain from such withdraw yourselves
9359131 im still learning to pronounce her name but i think its exciting what i know about her and what it brings to the ticket
9359132 shes got all the people of alaska giving her a 93 percent approval rating i think that is a sign that this is going to energize the vice presidency its going to be a role model for women
9359133 we were just as surprised as everyone else to hear who the final pick was and all i knew who the governor of alaska was i had never met her or heard her speak before
9359134 i think that working mothers who have other kinds of jobs and have families and i understand what i heard at least from today on television that her husband has been to a great extent is a stay at home dad and its not like the family is being neglected
9359135 a draw was on reflection probably a fair result with neither side doing enough to warrant three points now there is an international break for questions to be asked and answered before we travel to manchester city on september 13
9359136 any sense of choking anti climax which might normally have strangled chelsea appeared to have eased by the time this squad strolled through their post match lap of honour in the sunshine
9359137 this was not the most impressive display from chelsea it was a hard fought win on a bitterly cold afternoon in the north east but you cannot play derby every week and you get
9359138 it is my duty as a head of government to express to you in the name of the italian people our regret and apologies for the deep wounds that we have caused you
9359139 the accord will provide for 200 million dollars a year over the next 25 years through investments in infrastructure projects in libya
9359140 this agreement should put an end to 40 years of discord it is a concrete and moral acknowledgement of the damage inflicted on libya by italy during the colonial era
9359141 this is an historic moment when two brave men acknowledge the defeat of colonialism
9359142 the libyan people endured injustice and were attacked in their homes and they deserve an apology and compensation
9359143 a sudden burst of dignity humanity and respect so as to finally give satisfaction to the 20 000 italian citizens who are still waiting for fair compensation from their government
9359144 the withdrawal of british and irish buyers from the bulgarian market was prompted by the financial crisis in their countries but also by the bad infrastructure and the excess of concrete here
9359145 a decline in speculative investment will have a sanitising effect on the economy
9359146 real estate for bulgaria was like oil and gold for other countries
9359147 more and more often we come to a point where we see how money that we have reasons to believe came from criminal activities is wired through foreign banks and returned here in the form of investment

9359153 ian is a very determined guy i love his attitude and what he did at the open that back nine he played with the intention to win and had that emotional feeling
9359154 nick rang me after my last round at gleneagles to say that i wasnt going to be one of his picks and i simply wished him all the best
9359155 obviously i am disappointed that i wasnt selected but i have dealt with much worse and it will make me all the more determined to make the team that will play in wales next time
9359156 there was a qualifying period and i didnt make it automatically so you will not hear any sour grapes from me i couldnt have tried any harder and i devoted myself to the european tour to give myself the best possible chance but although i have won twice this year it obviously wasnt enough
9359157 i fully respect the captains decision and i would like to wish him and his team all the very best for valhalla i will be supporting them from wherever i am

9359169 amy winehouse should have arrived on the site early friday evening
9359170 we were told by her agent at 20 00 local time that she wasnt coming
9359171 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness
9359172 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9359173 det nye blodet i harm har kommet i form av yvind v gane p trommer en liten tynn kar p 18 r han er et naturtalent og et stort potensiale for bandet s er det storebroren til yvind andreas en 24 r gammel killer riffmaker med stor entusiasme og ikke minst en j vel p speedsoloer de jobber hardt for bandet og har i sterk kontrast til de andre som ville pr vespille for harm p gangsmot de kommer begge fra power metal og har drevet med den stilen i noen r alt fra prosjekter til mindre band osv
9359174 planen framover er spille en del live for vise at vi lever og for gi bort noen smakebiter fra den nye skiva som er i pre produksjon n harm kommer aldri til slippe skiver kjapt og jevnt men n r det er klart da er det faen d tte meg klart ogs
9359175 det har v rt en tung tid med f alle bitene p plass
9359176 og det kreves en enorm selvdisiplin etter s mye motbakke som har v rt i harm alle disse rene en av grunnene til at jeg startet bandet var for ha et band der hovedfokuset l i ikke gi opp det er bare et alternativ og det er v re sterk det er klart at kravene er h ye men ikke noe h yere enn det man skal forvente i et band og akkurat der dukker 70 av metalmusikerene under
9359177 som nevnt tidligere fikk jeg tydelig bevis for det n r folk skulle pr vespille det er mange veike sjeler der ute dessverre n r det gjelder den besetningen jeg hadde med meg p devil er de gode musikere men de hadde heller ikke det som skulle til og det var et slag i trynet
9359178 ja devil ble gitt ut p sublife og med tanke p at det bare er en mann som driver det selskapet ble det helt greit promotert men jeg er langt fra forn yd med tanke p mengden arbeid og penger som ligger i den utgivelsen
9359179 det var mange ledd som sviktet i den prosessen til og med metalbladet

9359188 im just delighted we got the win its been a tough week after the performance at manchester city and the way we played for much of the cup tie against macclesfield
9359189 its difficult with fans having a go at you after only two games but west ham fans are second to none when they get behind the team and thats what we want i can take any flak
9359190 everything went against me today and everything went for curbs im not happy because we had enough chances to change the course of the game
9359191 curbs is obviously a lucky manager but i know hes also a top manager and im pleased for him
9359192 hes a player who in an ideal world you would not want to lose but i just want to make it absolutely clear that at the end of the day it was my decision to sell him
9359193 we got an offer that i feel was his value we are all aware james has had a difficult time he almost signed for them once before and was dragged back
9359194 but he has always behaved impeccably hes a fantastic professional and theres no doubt about it theyve got an outstanding player and we have got to move on
9359195 we are delighted to have been involved in the deal that has taken james from newcastle to aston villa
9359196 clearly the offer was too good for newcastle to refuse
9359197 the negotiations went smoothly and i have to say that martin oneill was top class
9359198 i am very pleased with the performance both offensively and defensively it was a complete one there was great balance in the team with movement
9359199 apart from at the start of the second half we were always in control and played the game we love and showed the way we can play the improvement comes from a completely different attitude
9359200 we showed that against twente and did it again against newcastle the fulham match had come at the start of the season after difficult games including one away in the champions league and maybe we were not ready mentally
9359201 we do not know yet he has to have an x ray on his ankle hopefully nothing is broken
9359202 he is the link between the midfield and the strikers which is very important in the game we want to play
9359203 robin showed that when he is good shape physically he is a very important player for us
9359204 we are trying to buy new players but the problem is always first of all the availability and also the fact that its finding players who are better or at least as good as the ones we already have
9359205 we came up against a side who had to bounce back from a poor result
9359206 id been waiting for jermain defoe to come good him and peter crouch and it was nice to see them link up together
9359207 defoe scored a great goal hes got that ability and he also worked very hard for the team as well it was a great result for us
9359208 and david james is different class that was a world class save in the first half from mikel arteta to keep us 1 0 up and then to save the penalty from yakubu as well hes a fantastic goalkeeper
9359209 we are not in condition to win premier league matches we have not got players in the right slots and senior players are not playing the way they should be weve got a lot of young players in the side but its not those players who are letting us down
9359210 i dont think we have played well in any game so far although i thought we probably played better here than we did when we won at west brom and lost at home to blackburn
9359211 portsmouth defended well and took their chances we defended poorly and didnt take our chances
9359212 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9359213 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9359214 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9359215 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9359216 laba arimood oo dadka tahriibayaasha ah siyaadin jiray baa kulmay kuwaasoo kala ah bad furanka iyo ramadaanka

9359219 the vibe on the bob marley sessions was always real he had a way of generating energy in the studio jumping and dancing the minute the music began inspiring all the musicians with his enthusiasm so we would give our best
9359220 when we came across his story through the network of contacts we have across the african music industry we realised that we had found someone significant whose contribution to music has been underexposed although channel o is youth focused we feel that it is important to pay tribute to the greats who have laid the foundation for future talent
9359221 here is a remarkable musician who has made significant contributions to the african music industry as well as achieved international recognition we know that africa has many highly talented artists who have the ability to make the whole world sit up and take notice and george is proof of this

9359224 i couldnt even lock the dead bolt or open the windows
9359225 do you really think i could have ever missed a crack like that
9359226 not related to the construction of the embankment or pile driving operation
9359227 it is our position there is no negligence on the part of any state employee and no legal liability
9359228 it wasnt until a week later that it hit me im here by myself
9359229 during my four years at douglass i became more aware of myself and my own values
9359230 i think that is as important for undergraduates as learning about a particular subject matter
9359231 i wouldnt say i was totally disengaged but more of what was going on with me was trying to figure out how my academic work might be relevant to the issues of the day
9359232 my teaching was really informed by my time in washington
9359233 i think shes a great listener and can project what people are doing without being sell sell sell
9359234 it was also interesting to watch her be tough because she was still warm and friendly
9359235 i think linda is a very strong leader and i think she is going to figure out how to get uncg to the next level
9359236 wixii ka dambeeyay dilkii aadan cayroow dagaalada somalia way sii xoogeysteen wayna sii soconayaan xitaa hadii la dilo dhamaan masuuliyiinta caanka ah ee ka dagaalama somalia
9359237 clearly we will be seeking to establish whether it is the body of christopher foster
9359238 further tests are needed to establish whether the rifle found was the one used in the murder and to kill the animals
9359239 i run so much if i dont try to manage the rest of my life while running
9359240 every day became an act of quiet desperation waking up and hoping i could get through the day
9359241 i found very family oriented well adjusted essentially happy people who lack some things we take for granted
9359242 this movie is the next step in fulfilling my commitment to bring clean water to africa
9359243 were a huge lift to the runners at their toughest moments
9359244 i retraced my exact steps and that was the last time i stepped over a fence
9359245 im not the nicest guy all the time in this movie
9359246 i am the single minded driving force out there and i think thats necessary for somebody to be in that role
9359247 people will come away inspired by the fact that we are all very willing to show our weaknesses
9359248 i decided i had to make a change or i wasnt going to survive
9359249 what i have now is an addiction to living and making sure that i use my time as wisely and passionately as i possibly can
9359250 anything worth doing is worth doing to the absolute maximum
9359251 hes got a motor inside him and it has to be on and the challenge for him is that he has that vehicle pointed in the right direction
9359252 its not just about the records or the accomplishment its about those things advancing good causes
9359253 i am a good athlete but nothing special when it comes to genetics
9359254 i genuinely believe when i set my mind to something i am going to get it done
9359255 im about two thirds of the way to the end and then ill come back
9359256 with the sahara we did 20 miles on day one and spent the first week getting our bodies used to it
9359257 with this we have to run 70 miles on day one and on day 45 so theres no ramping up
9359258 i want to talk to people about the state of the country and i dont mean politics but what their impression of being a good american is
9359259 i am a student of human nature and i am curious to ask questions about what drives other people
9359260 kids are not motivated by words theyre motivated by actions
9359261 i think they will take great interest in watching this crazy old guy try to run across the country
9359262 means that it will start snowing in the mountains and in colorado and i couldnt make it through
9359263 to tell you the truth its very unlikely i can set this record
9359264 this is my attempt to do something deemed to be impossible i am very excited about putting myself in that position but have no idea what the outcome will be
9359265 and frankly thats kind of the point i wouldnt do it if i knew i could
9359266 i just swallowed a bug its the way i get protein these days

9359270 ive always been drawn to nature botanicals that kind of design
9359271 modern rustic seemed to fit with this 200 year old building
9359272 there are so many ways to give back to the environment
9359273 im a design studio but im also trying to lead people along the path of doing things in their home that are environmentally friendly
9359274 this corner with fresh market across the street its a high traffic area
9359275 i was very much hoping he would choose a woman
9359276 the conventions for the most part serve as a mechanism to rally the troops and provide a snapshot for the larger population of what the party and what the nominee hope to emphasize during the campaign
9359277 over the past two years of democrats running congress we have seen nothing in the way of new solutions theyre promising to all the problems that are facing our nation
9359278 on very important things mccain has differed with the president
9359279 they need to highlight things to show that hes the true maverick
9359280 to me its all about the powerful and the privileged taking advantage of a working class african american community
9359281 greensboro college would never purchase property in irving park or starmount or college hill
9359282 youre putting a predominantly white school in the middle of a black neighborhood and expecting people not to be upset
9359283 there are so many positives that could come out of a situation like this
9359284 to get us out of here to do what they want to do
9359285 we have great respect for what warnersville means in the historical sense and what it means to the people living there today
9359286 and we want to pay tribute to j c price in a way that benefits individuals today
9359287 its not for someone else to come in and tell us what we can do with our neighborhood
9359288 every year every month that we are together it will improve
9359289 his family came into the locker room before the game we told them this was going to be for them
9359290 we lose as a family and we win as a family im elated we can finally stop talking about it and move on
9359291 somalis can overcome their problems only by adopting islamic law

9359295 the drought in the sahel in the 1970s created a shortage of watering holes
9359296 sometimes the elephants even break into our reserves and chase people to get the fruits because they dont have enough water
9359297 the problem we have is the lack of water we have excellent pasture but there is often not enough water for elephants and humans to share
9359298 the best water sources are hidden in the forest and the elephants open it up by trampling down the bush and exposing the grass to light they break off small branches which goats cannot reach often youll see a herder with his goats following the elephants through the forest
9359299 many herders and farmers take the arrival of the elephants as the start of the rainy season they wont plant until they see them because the elephants wont move until theyre sure they can find water
9359300 we are developing a tourist industry here based on wildlife in a way similar to safari
9359301 guides who come from bamako have little sympathy or understanding for life in the north so we are training local guides and building tourist camps so that northerners can profit from and fight to save their natural resources
9359302 the aircraft was in my judgment never airworthy from the first release to service in 1969
9359303 the action they are taking against the secretary of state for defence is three fold
9359304 this is another opportunity for us to progress our preparations against a very good french side and at the same time re introduce some players to our squad
9359305 we have competition for places across the squad and that intensity is going to be vital for us after tomorrows game we only have one more opportunity in pre season before the guinness premiership starts so it is very important we see a step up in what we are trying to achieve
9359306 we appreciate tomorrows game will be another step up physically and that is a good thing it is up to us to generate good habits now and build on them
9359307 in three separate co ordinated attacks in bayelsa delta and rivers states which began about 19 30 hrs on saturday august 30 2008 fighters from the movement for the emancipation of the niger delta mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force jtf responsible for the killings of men women and children from their so called
9359308 operation hunter hunted involved the use of several fast attack speedboats general purpose machine guns rocket propelled grenades and the deadly soviet made anti tank missiles at close range combat
9359309 the precise locations of the battles are odiama creek in bayelsa opia river in delta and the confluence of bonny and andoni river in rivers state
9359310 journalists should visit the locations mentioned above as soon as possible to witness the wreck of gunboats which were still burning when we left to forestall any denial by the military
9359311 from our count the predominantly ethnic northern jtf lost a total of 29 soldiers in the combined assault we cannot account for those that jumped into the water in panic and drowned we lost six of our gallant fighters
9359312 in three separate co ordinated attacks in the states of bayelsa delta and rivers which began at about 19 30 on saturday yesterday fighters from mend carried out reprisals on the military joint task force
9359313 one of the biggest successes recorded in the intensifying fight against illicit activities in the niger delta
9359314 been in politics for four decades and now im an overnight sensation
9359315 i want to thank the victory fund and the human rights campaign for helping set the tone for what we are doing this weekend we have to move people away from fear and to hope to win this election
9359316 change never happens easily we need you i am grateful to you
9359317 the values of freedom and equal opportunity which have given him his historic chance will drive him as president to give all americans regardless of race religion gender sexual orientation or disability their chance to build a decent life and to show our humanity as well as our strength to the world
9359318 i know there are differences on same sex marriage but surely we can agree that our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters deserve to visit the person they love in the hospital and to live lives free of discrimination
9359319 we are blowing up the straight men of privilege paradigm
9359320 we wont be renewing our vows i think once was enough and ive just paid out on a big party for her birthday
9359321 trust me the party was infinitely more expensive than the paintings the director said
9359322 tottenham played very well and they are a team that plays football
9359323 i learned that sometimes we need more chances in england if you have only two or three shots on goal you never win
9359324 we had more chances but we made mistakes on the final shot and today we have not won but i am satisfied with my team
9359325 it was a game that was a little strange and unusual
9359326 the performance of ronaldinho makes me optimistic there are always surprises at the start of the championship some teams are not yet on top form and others are more prepared as were bologna today
9359327 i do not believe there were major shortcomings the team has done a good match and was punished in two situations maybe we could have been more united at the end but from a physical point of view we could have done any more
9359328 this team can do good things and did so again today playing at an excellent level at the beginning of the second half
9359329 sheva he returned today after two years out and even for him it will take some time for him to rediscover his best condition
9359330 this is our first time here and were delighted you live on a beautiful island
9359331 i believe that until the 60th minute we deserved to be in the lead
9359332 we were penalised by the sending off in 10 men and with this heat we couldnt keep up with lazios rhythm
9359333 we controlled the match well after taking the lead overall i am satisfied even though there are some problems in our mutual understanding
9359334 there are four new arrivals the team still needs to gel
9359335 it was an open match and anything could have happened napoli defended well and did well to take advantage of situations that went their way
9359336 thiago neves is a young player who has recently been grabbing the attention in brazil not only at club level but also at the copa libertadores
9359337 with his creativity and his scoring prowess thiago will be a crucial part of our attacking game
9359338 this transfer allows us to occupy the position of playmaker with a quality man for the coming five years in the signing of thiago neves we have added creativity to our squad
9359339 matches last a long time in the first half i think we were paying too much respect to our opponents and were maybe overawed by chelsea
9359340 in the second half we kept the ball regularly and deserved the point that we got
9359341 i followed the match from belgium along with the clubs ceo pedro tom s
9359342 this has been an extraordinary year for me in just 40 days ive won a gold medal in the olympics with argentina and now ive been lucky enough to play in a league as competitive as the spanish one
9359343 i know much is required of me but im prepared and im happy to be with espanyol a club who trust me
9359344 ill seek to adapt as quickly as possible i know that there are other argentines in the team and thats going to help im here to seize my chance
9359345 ill try to ensure that the team are content with me and ill work alongside them
9359346 im delighted to return to the spanish league and ill do my best to help make it a good season
9359347 i wanted to prove myself in the french league where i found a championship thats very strong and very physical i had to adapt to this i managed goals but here my style of play is much more suitable
9359348 roma started the match very well and especially in the first half they put us in difficulty
9359349 in the second half however we defender very well without conceding many chances to roma we played better
9359350 we certainly showed we are more in shape physically and that second half left us with some regrets
9359351 i congratulate our players and the coach i saw beautiful goals
9359352 i must say that that the game went better than expected
9359353 di vaio was immediately a protagonist in the italian cup and today he had a great game just as valiani and all the others did
9359354 i am very satisfied i had the objective to bring bologna into serie a and we have also had a good debut for me is an unexpected result
9359355 have put together their plans and they following those plans right now
9359356 its low so even bad thunderstorm can cause us to have standing water anything of that magnitude causes us concern because of the water surge
9359357 they have been so hard hit already and another event of this magnitude would continue to devastate those areas and all of the recovery work that had already been accomplished
9359358 right now were just trying to focus on being prepared and making sure that people are prepared and getting out of town and securing what they do have well deal with the aftermath of it the recovery efforts if need be we hope thats not the case but certainly its always a possibility
9359359 now we are waiting were as a prepared as we can be we are just watching the news
9359360 for me the tsunami was a starting point i never asked if it was a good or a bad thing
9359361 my story is about a couple who have lost a child i tried to deal with their sorrow with a certain distance and respect without being melodramatic
9359362 i never felt we were being insensitive or treading on peoples toes having seen fabrices first film i realised he wouldnt deal with mourning and the loss of a child in a normal way
9359363 for people in the west death is a taboo its fearful and dizzying in thailand there is this idea that death is continuative
9359364 they believe certain souls have to be released because theyre stuck between two levels we the living are holding them back

9359371 schuster no es mi padre y l tampoco me va a obligar a hacer nada
9359372 mientras pensaba que iba a fichar a cristiano ronaldo el club no ten a tantas ganas
9359373 no ha conseguido fichar a nadie robinho ya vale tanto
9359374 me he molestado porque desde mayo estaba mi padre con mi representante tratando de renovar mi contrato y hasta que el club pensaba que iba a fichar a ronaldo no ten a tantas ganas de renovarme y no fue una ni dos ni tres veces fueron mil veces que mi padre y el representante acudieron a hablar al club para renovar el contrato y tampoco demostr inter s en mi permanencia en el real madrid
9359375 el club no se interes mucho porque estaba seguro de que iba a fichar a cristiano ronaldo
9359376 yo no tengo nada contra cristiano ronaldo me parece un excelente jugador aclar robinho pero yo tambi n tengo mi valor y mi orgullo y ahora como el club no ha conseguido fichar nada ya es un problema mi salida y robinho ya vale tanto
9359377 lo que ha pasado es que yo he llegado al presidente y le he dicho que ten a una propuesta del chelsea y l me dijo que si era buena me dejar a ir l no habl de dinero porque estaba seguro de que iba a fichar otro jugador y me dijo bueno si viene una propuesta buena te dejamos salir y ahora como estamos al final del plazo y no han fichado a nadie
9359378 a principios de mayo mi padre ya estaba aqu con mi representante el club le dijo que volviera en septiembre o sea cuando se cierran las negociaciones entonces el problema es que el club no ha conseguido fichar a nadie y por eso estamos aqu hasta hoy y yo no he conseguido mi objetivo que es jugar en el chelsea
9359379 yo he hablado con pedja mijatovic con el presidente y l me dijo que me liberar a y la nica persona que no me est dejando salir es schuster por lo que s yo porque no ha conseguido fichar a nadie y tampoco quiere dejarme salir
9359380 schuster no es mi padre es un entrenador es comandante y yo soy atleta de f tbol schuster no es mi padre y l tampoco me va a obligar a hacer nada
9359381 yo tengo la cabeza ah y se lo he dicho al entrenador a schuster pero dijo que me iba a recuperar yo hasta ahora no tuve problemas con nadie en el vestuario pero si el entrenador cree que va a recuperar a un jugador que no tiene la cabeza en el club es responsabilidad suya porque yo no quiero seguir en el real madrid y estoy diciendo esto por mil sima vez
9359382 pedja mijatovic ha dicho que me dejar a salir el presidente tambi n pero schuster se ha comprometido a que no no tiene que recuperarme para nada yo hasta ahora no tuve problemas con el vestuario hasta ahora respeto a todos mis compa eros a todos los jugadores pero si schuster cree que dej ndome aqu no va a tener problema es una responsabilidad suya
9359383 si yo tengo que estar un a o sin jugar bueno yo me recupero soy joven tengo veinticuatro a os y si tengo que estar un a o sin jugar me rehar es el destino
9359384 si tengo mi contrato voy a jugar incontento puede que s puede que no pero si tengo que jugar voy a jugar porque me quedan dos a os m s aqu firmados
9359385 tenemos que centrarnos en la liga porque el m laga viene con los cuchillos afilados
9359386 me gustar a que el tema robinho estuviera cerrado pero no es as y por eso no viajar a la coru a
9359387 el valencia me ha dado mucho en tres a os como para forzar mi marcha

9359402 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9359403 faith communities entirely refute the allegation that faith schools are discriminatory
9359404 actually can we cut to the chase here most of them are actually church schools run by the church of england and the roman catholic church theyre the ones that secular minded parents are lying and cheating and going to church to get their children into
9359405 but its precisely the fact that they are discriminatory that makes them catholic or anglican or jewish or muslim
9359406 it is refreshing to hear a defender of faith schools tell the truth and accept that faith schools are routinely discriminating in both employment and admissions it is deeply regrettable though that such discrimination should be the basis of what defines and forms the religious ethos of a school

9359408 acer and asus can shave a month off the four to five months it typically takes dell or hewlett packard to design a notebook
9359409 technology companies are competing to capitalize on the opportunity offered by this dynamic market
9359410 the quality of the components made in the greater china region has continued to impress the world
9359411 there is a need for quality components in bulk that complement built in new ic technologies and we have the supplier base that enables this
9359412 the technology is not a computer platform but rather a set of specialized firmware and software to enable nor flash in data center environments
9359413 with spansion ecoram and viridents greengateway we have the potential to cut the worlds energy use in internet data center servers by up to 75 percent and reduce the total cost of ownership for internet companies
9359414 todays servers were not built with the data centric needs of the internet in mind
9359415 as a result computer centric servers in internet data centers can be made far more efficient with faster access to larger main memories
9359416 we are talking to end users and oems about the technology
9359417 the real question is based on the application does it truly optimize
9359418 will drive smaller case sizes and higher power in a given case size
9359419 were advised to film silent gunfire shots for their numerous gunfight scenes
9359420 we are pleased to have reached the upper end of our revenue guidance in spite of the challenging macroeconomic environment
9359421 focus is really on mcus and obviously on high growth high margin proprietary products and technologies
9359422 we will also continue to look into possible acquisitions that will add more value into our mcu portfolio
9359423 our core strategy is moving from a company not only selling mcus but a company selling mcu system solutions
9359424 expanding our technical sales relations with our sales team reaching our customers directly as well as enhancing our relationships with our broad base of customers
9359425 the story is all about china we are investing not only in our sales force but also in our technical sales resources we are probably looking into doubling our technical resources in china
9359426 india is a very interesting location india started in the it space the infrastructure needs to catch up for manufacturing and hardware
9359427 taiwan is most of the time overshadowed by mainland chinas growth
9359428 it really depends on what angle you look at taiwan from odms like asus hon hai the laptop guys quanta and compal these guys are growing the region
9359429 the nature of the global economy is if there is an economic slowdown in the u s there will definitely be an effect however i wouldnt go to the extent of saying that we feel jittery people are still optimistic albeit with caution
9359430 the movement is clear asian engineers are looking into more integration today mcu is no longer a general purpose device it now comes with added functionalities with usb with mac mixed signal functionality the like people are jumping very quickly from 8bit to 32bit
9359431 as costs continue to escalate and r amp d becomes more difficult gartner expects a greater percentage of r amp d to be outsourced
9359432 the thing that really excited us was the fact that they are going to open source all of android
9359433 we think that will lead to a lot of innovation
9359434 we have no idea where people are going to take this
9359435 mobile application processors are hitting a spot where we can deliver the internet at very low power broadband wireless technologies are being deployed and the internet itself has reached a point where it is ubiquitous

9359447 to explore the american perceptions of what vietnam means and what images it conjures up
9359448 vietnam was always abstract to me as it is to the american people
9359449 i went to vietnam to really figure out what this word vietnam means to me
9359450 many exhibits in the u s try to capture something about vietnam with a capital letter v that overwhelms viewers
9359451 exhibits like that dont correspond to reality they show some imaginary vietnam left over from movies
9359452 i chose 10 artists for the exhibit because i wanted it to include a variety of media including painting photography and video i felt each woman artist represented some aspect of vietnamese women in vietnam each has their own personal story yet each comes from a different background
9359453 i liked this exhibit because it focuses on recent art produced in the past decade which has been a time of tremendous change that provided women with new opportunities and new challenges
9359454 presenting visions of contemporary vietnamese society that departs from the expectations many americans have about a war torn society
9359455 just open your eyes look and have your own intuitive response
9359456 theres no war in this art its not about politics
9359457 these are individual women who have no blanket statement to make or overall message to give theyre artists and their works are what they have to say
9359458 i started making crafts as a hobby it was something fun to do
9359459 i have been making crafts for 10 or 15 years and two years ago i hooked up with lisa and we started doing the show together
9359460 i did not care for the way they advertised which was no advertising
9359461 she lucy is a good girl we will have to do something special for her
9359462 we wanted to draw all types of people and have something for everyone
9359463 it started as an accident i made something one day and terry told me i could sell it
9359464 i do all my own sawing painting and sanding it has really taken off the last few years
9359465 i bought one similar to what i make now and i am pretty creative
9359466 and i am actually much better at it than i thought i would be
9359467 they are very popular we have people buy them from us year round
9359468 my husband is very generous to me i spend a lot of money on this stuff
9359469 i love candles and the sprays i like to keep my house smelling nice
9359470 with the high cost of fuel people who need to just run a few errands around town dont need to be in a gas guzzling car
9359471 i really just wanted to ride around on it and have fun
9359472 its easy you can just jump on it and go now its more about saving gas
9359473 in all this short time travel i only use about five gallons of gasoline a year
9359474 with gas prices going up all the time the people of west lafayette could save a lot of money running their errands on golf carts
9359475 we may have to look at that situation and well try to monitor it
9359476 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9359477 they have to respond to the democrats but business as usual is not possible
9359478 i am thrilled with the choice i think shes a game changer
9359479 pay attention for a day or two and then go back to voting on the issues
9359480 in the latest attempt to vilify independent journalists the state controlled sinhala language daily dinamina carried a front page headline story on 28th august alleging that high level investigations were underway on a group of journalists who supported ltte though the hiru newspaper
9359481 the news story with the byline of wijayani edirisinghe used anonymous
9359482 these unproved unverified allegations were given a wide publicity by state controlled electronic media on the same day putting the lives of the journalists associated with the story at grave risk
9359483 the ltte group may have been given specific orders to infiltrate into the liberated areas and cause destruction to both civilian and military targets triggering a slow down of the military advances into the last ltte bastion in kilinochchi and mullaitivu districts
9359484 the main reason mccain knuckled under to the religious right by picking palin is that he actually believes theres a large army of embittered hillary loyalists who will vote for a hard line conservative simply because shes a woman
9359485 i am loving it here everyone has been so welcoming and to see a whole town like this it is incredible what has been done here today
9359486 the kids have been well behaved and they even knew all the lines to the royle family i dont even remember the lines to the royle family
9359487 i hope that i will be asked back again in the future if workington puts another event like this on because we are in a beautiful part of the country and it has been a pleasure to be here
9359488 it has been a fantastic turn out by the people of workington and everyone can be very proud of the show that has been put on
9359489 a year of hard work has gone into making paint the town red happen and it has been a total success
9359490 from the rotary club to the shops and businesses in this town we have all done our bit and for me it is great to see so many families enjoying the day
9359491 it was absolutely stupendous i think for me the pinnacle of the day was when jimmy james was doing his finale and the fireworks went off overhead from curwen park
9359492 that was a truly spectacular moment the whole audience was bouncing and it just finished off the day perfectly it has put a mark down and set a stamp for the future
9359493 we always had great shows here and i think that today is one of them people can live together in a community and not meet but this kind of event brings them together
9359494 i hope it will get better and better as it goes on
9359495 it was awesome he put me in the boot while the car was on two wheels i was leaning out of the passenger seat when the car was on its side and waving out the window
9359496 i really enjoyed the day and i hope that its something that can be put on every year its absolutely great
9359497 i am pleased for workington and i hope this will come to equal whitehavens maritime festival
9359498 the way mamata banerjee is demanding it is impossible for the state government to meet her demand

9359500 the patient is now recovering and we hope to discharge him today sunday
9359501 i have not extended the deadline to put marathi signboards on shops

9359503 i congratulate central leadership and state government for finishing off this crisis the issue less agitation which was on for the last 62 days has reached its destination the issue was imposed on the religious faiths of the people people of jammu including children and elderly strongly opposed the discrimination against them finally the order came on saturday
9359504 as i have said what has been told to me ill see the official draft also but what has been told to me gives me satisfaction
9359505 this is the victory of sacrifice and contribution of people of jammu jammu and kashmir and central government have been forced to bow down to accept the demand of hindus
9359506 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks they looked great
9359507 the issue i am writing to you about today is not a laughing matter i understand and appreciate the importance of uniforms but continuing to use real fur in the 21st century is inexcusable regardless of tradition
9359508 the public are relying on you to bring about a humane changing of the guards
9359509 werent getting proper food or water and they were tied outside in 115 degree heat
9359510 on behalf of our thousands of members and supporters in arizona we respectfully urge your office to prosecute simmons to the fullest extent of the law
9359511 as simmons alleged conduct might well demonstrate repeat crimes are the rule rather than the exception among animal abusers so we implore your office to take every measure necessary to ensure that simmons if convicted is barred from owning or harboring animals for as long as possible
9359512 that one relationship is gonna work cause im gonna make it work
9359513 i think that bobby is a big romantic and really does believe in love
9359514 his parents are still married after all these years and i think that he will find that again
9359515 1 my doctor says i am right on target with my weight gain 2 have not been to planet blue in at least two years 3 love my maternity jeans they have stretchy tops it is awesome
9359516 carrying a child is the most inspiring emotional amazing experience of my life my weight and my pant size are the absolute last thing i am concerned about
9359517 i am only concerned with having a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby people who talk and judge pregnant womens weight need to get a life
9359518 i cant even think about having another baby right now the boys take up so much of my time
9359519 life is busy in los angeles because brooklyns got football romeos got gymnastics and cruz has break dancing plus they have school commitments
9359520 we really respect people who go through adoption but its not something we have considered as we have our hands full with the three children we do have
9359521 she kelly shouted loudly in my ear i have an issue with you my boyfriend knows what an earthquake is and everyone has been laughing at him and hes upset
9359522 then i felt a hard slap to my right cheekbone i put my hand to my face while my friends looked on aghast
9359523 soon kelly came rampaging back over with a female friend jabbing a finger in the air telling me that id have to watch my back if i shared my story with readers of this column
9359524 ive lost count of the number of times they scream at each other normally when they have had a drink its become a weekly event
9359525 it usually starts late at night all hell breaks loose with them shouting and screaming the neighbours must be sick of it by now
9359526 there was a nice big kiss at the end with both hands on the cheeks they looked great
9359527 you talk about that as a dead end silo while selling end to end business processes
9359528 i dont think it will lead to an increase in demand for siebel
9359529 i expect this is a strategy by oracle to keep its siebel customers from looking outside of the barn
9359530 the entire industry has to get better at making money selling on demand thats what were focused on before we scale the business
9359531 no fancy equipment is required to read the data array once it is unlocked
9359532 every time you write data it might write to a different part of the disk and then change the directory table around so it forgets where the data was written before
9359533 if all the software does is write over the top of the lbas i dont think itll be as effective on an ssd as it may have missed remnants from the previous wear levelling or something like that because the software doesnt know about that
9359534 bettys a hero now people come up to me and say i love that show i love the message its sending
9359535 betty is such an important role model for young girls
9359536 there is an egreement in principal between vodafone telstraclear and telecom
9359537 amy winehouse should have arrived on the site early friday evening
9359538 we were told by her agent at 20 00 local time that she wasnt coming
9359539 amy winehouse was regrettably unable to perform at the rock en seine show in paris due to illness
9359540 she was taken ill at her house and wasnt able to travel to france for the concert
9359541 the truth is that amy ended up in hospital this week because she mixed up the medication shes taking to help her come off drugs
9359542 it is deeply worrying that after a number of major data losses and the publication of two government reports on high profile breaches of the data protection act more personal information has been reported lost
9359543 the data loss by a home office contractor demonstrates that personal information can be a toxic liability if it is not handled properly and reinforces the need for data protection to be taken seriously at all levels it is vital that sensitive information such as prisoner records is held securely at all times
9359544 the data was held in a secure format on the contractors site it was downloaded onto a memory stick for processing purposes which has since been lost
9359545 our high tech electronic borders system will allow us to count all foreign nationals in and out of the uk while checking them against watch lists
9359546 these checks make up just one part of britains triple ring of security alongside fingerprint visas for three quarters of the worlds population and the roll out of id cards for foreign nationals locking people to one identity
9359547 orcon buys three new minis a fleet and gets its public relations company pead to send out a release about it
9359548 the iconic 60s panel van they are peppy sporty smart and punch above their weight just like us
9359549 i havent seen anything from apple that seems to show its attack ing the enterprise market
9359550 client virtualisation will be very big but tech populism will be even bigger
9359551 theres a mind shift happening in it and were starting to see that change theyre loosening up their policies on whats acceptable
9359552 in the end they want their employees to be as productive as humanly possible so theyll approve tools that people are more comfortable with the tools they may be running at home
9359553 theyre saying if we can find some way to manage and support these we will
9359554 its all just less about what end users clients are running
9359555 certainly some businesses and also some us government agencies will explore diversifying their portfolios
9359556 weve talked to some who have explicit goals to have macs account for 10 of their client base for example but i think apple will continue a slow but steady increase not accelerate
9359557 in 2005 a new payroll system was needed because the existing one was expected to become increasingly unsupported in the near future
9359558 provide the payroll service with a new service desk pay clerking service technology systems and management processes
9359559 fronde will play an integral part and work with talent2 to provide the hosting services from their wellington facilities
9359560 we are working with datacom to increase the quality of the current service and to meet new needs
9359561 potential weaknesses reported by staff and not actual thefts or losses
9359562 its a lot easier for customers to put off the purchases of servers some software and applications and even desktops than it is to put off storage purchases
9359563 once a company moves into the digital world information just piles up youve got to have some place to put it
9359564 the emergence of content rich business applications in areas such as telecommunications media entertainment and web 2 0
9359565 customers can really get great bang for their buck in buying new storage systems
9359566 people have increasingly been buying storage not just to store the data but also because they want to parse out components for analysis
9359567 what they managed to do was turn a presentation that probably wouldnt have been noticed outside of a small community of people into something that everybody knows about
9359568 will need to spend a hell of a lot of money
9359569 that money will come out of taxpayers and subway riders pockets no matter how you slice it
9359570 with hundreds of desktops deployed and many hundreds more on order to be shipped the manager at the configuration centre reports system crashes frequently observed during testing after set up
9359571 ran digital photo flash cards from stowage through a virus check with the
9359572 checked another russian laptop today rsk 1 for software virus by scanning its hard drives and a photo disk
9359573 all a31p laptops onboard are currently being loaded with the latest norton antivirus software and updated definition files for increased protection
9359574 it was never a threat to any command and control or operations computer
9359575 i dont know when the first one was but the station will have been in orbit for 10 years come november
9359576 if there is any good news at all its that the malware was designed to steal usernames and passwords from computer game players not something that orbiting astronauts are likely to be spending a lot of time doing
9359577 healthlink had earlier refused to sign the network interconnection agreement until it could be certain that the computer systems of more than 700 healthlink client organisations could be adequately protected
9359578 hisac has now given healthlink a written undertaking that secure network providers will be required to observe two following rules
9359579 we are very pleased that hisac and the ministry have done the right thing and renewed their commitment to the use of security standards ensuring that patient information is kept private is vitally important and it is not an area in which we can take chances
9359580 when you type in sony camera it might be nice not just to get a description of the camera and a picture but also to know where you can get the best prices and see them on a map
9359581 i think the survey side is an excellent tool they could get good value from that i would use it more as a marketing tool
9359582 we ship two versions a year now so expect it in the second or third cycle
9359583 thats one of the ideas we have for the next year to move forward to the mobile form
9359584 you have the ability to affect more systems in the whole forest if you do something
9359585 you just didnt have that power before now all of a sudden you can do whatever you want
9359586 make sure you size it correctly and really understand how much horsepower your applications need
9359587 you have to monitor your pool so you dont run out of space because that would really crash everything
9359588 if you virtualise both then you have the maximum flexibility when deploying new applications
9359589 you can gain tremendous benefits from storage virtualisation even without server virtualisation its harder the other way around
9359590 a lot of people think storage virtualisation has a prerequisite of heterogeneity that it only comes into play when storage from three companies is involved
9359591 i say forget it it has value even if you are stuck with a single vendor
9359592 you just want to combine the power of those two boxes and manage it as one
9359593 without storage virtualisation you cant do it thats how ridiculous the world of storage is
9359594 that means emcs invista supports dmxs and clariions and they might support some other foreign devices but the support for foreign devices always lags and support for foreign devices is always incomplete the whole idea is dont support your enemies boxes
9359595 i say to the it people i talk to if youre a hitachi data systems customer and you like working with them and youre stuck with them just buy their virtualisation to make life more manageable within hitachi product
9359596 there are certain technologies that are just smarter and better than people doing it manually
9359597 there really isnt anything here that should be too troubling for organisations
9359598 if you are taking in card numbers and phone numbers and entering them into systems that are not yours
9359599 people most in need of a clear and explicit warning regarding ssl certificates are inexperienced users and those are not very likely to understand the error message that firefox 3 is displaying a large portion will simply be scared away thinking that the web site is broken
9359600 mozilla firefox 3 limits usable encrypted ssl websites to those who are willing to pay money to one of their approved digital certificate vendors this policy is bad for the web
9359601 used to be the stuff of scary security fiction but now they are point and click
9359602 the only thing that will tell you whether the sites you are visiting are real is the existence of a trusted certificate which only the legitimate site can have
9359603 unable to say whether or not the deployment has been successful
9359604 les salari s sont partis en vacances avec dans la t te le discours des dix huit mois coul s
9359605 cest la douche froide m me si je ne sais pas sur quoi cela d bouchera malaise ou encore plus de tensions
9359606 en dix ans nous sommes pass s de 20 30 de conflits dans les entreprises une entreprise sur trois est touch e par un conflit je dis donc au patronat ouvrez des espaces de dialogue
9359607 mais je v rifierai soigneusement que le gouvernement respecte les partenaires sociaux et la loi et tient parole
9359608 avec le d but de la saison froide et laugmentation de la consommation nous nous dirigeons vers une augmentation des prix ces facteurs peuvent amener les prix vers un niveau acceptable
9359609 usually deployments are for three weeks whether its three weeks or six weeks whatever ill go until they need me or tell me to come home
9359610 je pense que cette temp te sera le pire sc nario pour la r gion productrice dhydrocarbures
9359611 shes the only one of the four president vice president on both sides that has executive experience of any kind
9359612 i think he took away his only argument against obama that he had no experience
9359613 in queste due serate come associazione ci auguriamo che si possa aprire un ciclo nuovo e coinvolgente per un gruppo nato in poco tempo e gi pronto a proporsi come un punto di riferimento per nuove iniziative allinsegna del sociale
9359614 oramai al vomero una costante da quando sono state inaugurate le scale mobili di collegamento tra via scarlatti e la stazione di monte della funicolare di montesanto non si contano le volte che la prima rampa quella pi a valle non pu essere utilizzata perch afflitta da guasti dalle tante persone per lo pi anziani che devono raggiungere in salita larea di san martino cosa resa pi gravosa dalle temperature elevate di questi giorni afferma gennaro capodanno presidente del comitato valori collinari lultimo fermo infatti risale ai giorni scorsi e perdura a tuttoggi ma il motivo ignoto visto che presso limpianto non c neppure un cartello che annuncia il disservizio
9359615 considerando che per la realizzazione di tutto limpianto di collegamento conclude capodanno ci sono voluti circa due anni con una spesa di circa due milioni di euro sarebbe il caso che lamministrazione comunale nominasse una commissione dindagine per verificare i motivi di questi frequenti guasti che peraltro riguardano solo una delle tre rampe realizzate nonch le ragioni dei lunghi tempi di riparazione

9359619 for locally owned life insurance companies the main issue is agreeing on the value of the stake that is being negotiated
9359620 since life insurance is long term in nature it requires a more complex and specialised skill set to assess the companys intrinsic value
9359621 that means you can be buying a problem that has not been identified yet like high claims
9359622 just because you have 10 000 agents today does not mean they are going to be with you tomorrow thus you are trying to price part of the future business
9359623 a potential investor must have the determination and patience before the fruits of investment can be reaped
9359624 generally foreign companies are seen to have the necessary expertise and capability in taking the new entity to another level of development
9359625 budget 2009 seeks to ease farmers burden and that includes oil palm planters
9359626 this allocation is not just limited to big companies pursuing the rspo roundtable on sustainable palm oil certification
9359627 it is for all oil palm planters whether smallholders or estate owners who are implementing conservation programmes and enhancing biodiversity at their oil palm plantations in malaysia
9359628 this money can also be used to help plantation companies upgrade the school facilities at their estates
9359629 the immediate effect is higher energy costs and transportation charges that can be measured however it is the second round effect the effect of one sector passing on its costs to another sector thats hard to gauge
9359630 we are expecting a weaker second half due to lower crude palm oil prices rising fertiliser costs and flattish production growth
9359631 we may even see a further softening of the index in the remaining quarters this year
9359632 almost every sector didnt perform well except for the oil and gas sector

9359647 it will rapidly bring to fruition the countrys plans to connect broadband subscribers at areas that will never realistically receive fixed line services
9359648 we need to harness all our energy sources domestically to diversify the energy mix and fuel the infrastructure required for economic growth
9359649 the two men cornered the woman who was walking alone and they raped her we are still looking for the other man

9359651 alla mia associazione ha dichiarato dal suo canto antonio lupoli presidente dellassociazione padre ziello stata devoluta dal sindaco una parte dellindennit somma che viene destinata a tutti i nostri concittadini che hanno bisogno di aiuto e che spesso non hanno la possibilit di arrivare a fine mese
9359652 help me shake up washington and make it start working again for the people
9359653 you know it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9359654 as evidence that he can deliver the change that we need
9359655 the records clear john mccain has voted with george bush 90 percent of the time senator mccain likes to talk about judgment but really what does it say about your judgment when you think george bush was right more than 90 percent of the time i dont know about you but im not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change
9359656 america knows this is john mccains agenda and we cant afford four more years of the same
9359657 it just wouldnt be appropriate to have a festive occasion while a near tragedy or a terrible challenge is presented in the form of a natural disaster
9359658 so were monitoring it from day to day and im saying a few prayers too
9359659 i need beaver pennsylvania i need you to stand up beside me and say now is the time to bring about change in america
9359660 the proposals to send more u s forces to iraq would not produce a long term solution and would make our policy less not more sustainable
9359661 changing the dynamics surge and fight create breathing space and then accelerate the transition
9359662 our center of gravity public support is in jeopardy because of doubts that our iraq efforts are on a trajectory leading to success
9359663 this is a significant issue and they have to work to address it
9359664 these are some of the growing pains of a distribution becoming more complex they are building more and more into their operating systems and with that comes more complexity and more challenges but what i think is most important here is the response
9359665 at this time we are confident there is little risk to fedora users who wish to install or upgrade signed fedora packages
9359666 may obtain red hat binary packages via channels other than those of official red hat subscribers
9359667 we now have reason to believe that the logic error in the gems code can cause this event when no such antivirus program is installed on the server
9359668 we are indeed distressed that our previous analysis of this issue was in error
9359669 it is the dedication of board officials such as those at the butler county board of elections who went above and beyond the call of duty that gives me confidence that preparation with our local partners will lead to a successful november election
9359670 now that what appears to be the root cause for this voting tabulation error has been identified we will prepare ohios counties using the premier voting system software with instructions for following strict protocols needed to identify and correct this error if it occurs
9359671 we will continue to monitor the situation and provide boards of elections with the instruction and support they need to ensure an orderly and efficient election and an accurate count of ohioans votes
9359672 the banks growth projections are likely to be distinctly lower
9359673 but because the upside risks for price stability remain high the bank will continue to keep all its options open
9359674 we expect to see massive downward revisions on shipbuilders earnings over the next 12 month period driven by recent sharp increases in plate prices and other key raw material prices
9359675 companies are now guiding for margin declines until 2009 10
9359676 it is also aimed at utilisation of e commerce in facilitating the implementation of regional ftas
9359677 while the budget places key thrust on developing quality human capital no specific incentive addresses the ict industry
9359678 this is a serious concern as skills shortage remains acute in the industry unless it is addressed aggressively and decisively it will lead to erosion of our competitive edge
9359679 we urge for these incentives to be forthcoming across the year
9359680 since the second quarter growth of the domestic vehicle market has clearly slowed and because of delays in introducing own brand models sales have not hit their targets
9359681 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9359682 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9359683 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9359684 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9359685 when the ana afghan army and coalition troops got close to the village firing started after the ana unit stopped and the coalition forces conducted the operation in the village
9359686 among the victims there is not any foreign or internal taliban
9359687 its like what would happen if you drop flour it got all over them
9359688 ill tell you one thing you enjoy winning you kidding me
9359689 ill kick their butt tomorrow well get up tomorrow and learn those lessons
9359690 were better than that and we cant make the mistakes we made and get behind a team of that caliber and expect to be able to come back
9359691 weve got fast receivers on the outside and we took advantage of it
9359692 its a scary moment when an impact player like that goes down
9359693 it wasnt last time and hopefully weve learned from that tragedy
9359694 after 19 months of traversing through every state except alaska
9359695 which now that i think about it were going to have to go there now
9359696 it looks like theyre incredibly well prepared much better than they had before
9359697 should the window come back later we may be able to redress that with cheaper funding
9359698 knm is trying to close tail end funding of a large m amp a transaction in a difficult credit environment
9359699 probably the most difficult loan to price in this kind of credit environment
9359700 it represents an excellent standard form suitable for global use
9359701 our first experience with the standard contract form has been a positive one leaving us in no doubt that we will adopt it in future orders i
9359702 it is our hope that other owners will follow our lead and establish newbuildcon as the accepted international standard for new vessel orders
9359703 i keep raising the number because it just keeps holding better than expected
9359704 i want them to catch whoever shot and killed my brother this is not right it is another senseless killing i already lost one brother my oldest brother lonnie johnson was killed in frank holten state park no one has ever been arrested for his murder
9359705 not because its dangerous but because individuals involved need room and space to do their work
9359706 i had a big case with all our photos in it i dont know if they thought it was full of dvds but they took it
9359707 i had all our negatives put onto discs we have got three kids and every photo we had was on those discs some are replaceable but it took me three months to organise the lot of it
9359708 once inside they have ransacked most cupboards and draws most of the property was taken form the lounge room of the home
9359709 we would would like to hear of any vehicles that were in the area about that time or any suspicious activity
9359710 i have shed a few tears i couldnt even get it out at the police station
9359711 malaysia is chosen as the location due to our highly skilled workforce that provides the necessary human capital to cater for the various business functions of ibm the country has developed a reputation for providing robust national infrastructure at competitive costs
9359712 despite the loss after tax incurred in the current financial year the groups cash flow position remains healthy and is sufficient to service its current obligation
9359713 this subsea manufacturing centre is the first of its kind in the world it was set up to service the growing oil industry in both malaysia and the rest of the asia pacific this fourth contract with dsme is proof that we are ideally located to capitalise on the boom of new build drilling rigs of which many are built in asia
9359714 the meeting aims to reach an understanding on the generally accepted principles and practices on sovereign wealth funds in advance of the imf world bank annual meetings on october 10 13
9359715 there is an ongoing market for jewellery its a different ball game as people buy jewellery for pleasure and to be in trend
9359716 we will look at hong kong as a new retail centre and open one store a year from 2009 if the plan proves workable we will move to china in two years where the growth will be much faster and there will be a better chance of success
9359717 due to the high value products we offer we cant afford to sit on one single market
9359718 while we expect our two brands to be globally recognised via the setting up of retail stores overseas we want to do better financially
9359719 there will not be much impact on our performance from the weak global economy as the risk is spread over a wider market we are looking to replicate the 10 per cent compounded annual growth rate achieved in the past six years
9359720 there have been innumerable defaults one indian buyer alone has backed out on 80 000 tonnes of purchases the total defaults from india would be more than 500 000 tonnes
9359721 we have a specific strategy to be by 2011 a major force to contend with in the islamic bank arena
9359722 within five years i can see dubai bank almost on a global basis and represented in europe very much in asia and africa and at regional level in other gcc countries
9359723 it will be a combination of organic and acquisition based growth there are negotiations for joint ventures with certain countries whereby the target is to make sure we have control of an existing business
9359724 all options are on the table were looking at the sukuk islamic bonds market and syndicated loans
9359725 to ensure continuous growth in performance we will continue to work closely with our subsidiaries and make the necessary strategic changes
9359726 to put the problem in perspective fannie and freddie have a collective market value of us 8 1 billion us 1 rm3 39 in insurance protection exposure for more than us 5 5 trillion in insured mortgage instruments
9359727 if youve got a squirt gun in your pocket you may have to take it out
9359728 if youve got a bazooka and people know youve got it you may not have to take it out
9359729 we do not believe the gses will be successful in raising capital in the public markets on economically feasible terms
9359730 this will likely mark the end of the gses in their current format as an awkward public private hybrid we believe the gses will be nationalised in some form
9359731 building the infrastructure that mexico needs is basic for increasing the competitiveness of our economy
9359732 it usually takes a couple of days before we can start to get a significant amount of production back up
9359733 it can take several days for the subsea wells typically about half of our production comes back rather quickly
9359734 but were also working with local authorities to provide fuel along evacuation routes
9359735 appropriate planning is under way to allow for the safe shut down of refinery operations and the evacuation of refinery personnel as circumstances warrant
9359736 for everyone thinking they can ride this storm out i have news for you that will be one of the biggest mistakes you can make in your life
9359737 i got caught in the water and spent two days on my roof no food no water it was pretty bad
9359738 people are afraid of coming back after the storm they want some protection when they walk back in
9359739 ill never leave again just being away worrying about it last time id have rather been here
9359740 this reinforces the idea that treating patients with heart failure takes more than just drugs
9359741 with a lot of these patients you have no other choice
9359742 theyve tried other treatments and are at the end of the road
9359743 its a small benefit but we should always be emphasizing to patients what they can do in terms of diet that might help
9359744 this study changes the certainty of the evidence we have about fish oils
9359745 we dont want to build a giant factory that the market doesnt need or want
9359746 investors like to know what tax policies apply when they are putting millions of dollars down on a project theres a pretty clear history that these projects are less likely to go forward without a credit
9359747 these companies are shutting down projects firing people and its congresss fault
9359748 here we are three months later and ive yet to get a control number so i can track the status of my appeal
9359749 whats really sad is that nobody is giving them advice as to whether theyre even going to get relief
9359750 i think the public outrage should be focused on the units of local government that are levying the taxes that capture every cent they can get with little regard to the taxpayer

9359844 youre putting a gun to peoples heads and you say ok youre marrying this material now learn to love it
9359845 evolved stylistically to the point where we all love it were devoted to it
9359846 ive always been attracted to shows in which people get corrupted by one thing or another or fight against being corrupted morally or ethically
9359847 theres still a significant enough audience out there for this show to survive
9359848 the 1980s just called and it wants this drama back
9359849 tnt has hyped raising the bar as the latest landmark series from steven bochco but dont be misled raising the bar is no breakthrough arriving as bochcos umpteenth lawyer centric series it has a certain instant familiarity its glossy look and pat formula seem lifted from a couple of decades ago when such a drama might have felt cutting edge
9359850 many of the crew are taking pay cuts to come and work with us because they believe in what were doing
9359851 youre putting a gun to peoples heads and you say ok youre marrying this material now learn to love it

9359858 whenever i asked her direct questions about her day like what did you do in school today or did you have fun during recess i got one word answers and that was really frustrating
9359859 i will say something like mommy read a great book today and she will often chime in with we did some reading in school today too
9359860 i am a working mother so when my daughter wasnt talking with me about her day i felt really shut out of an important part of her life
9359861 parents are trying to get information and often their intensity scares their kids off so the kids just shut down
9359862 dont pounce on your child or children the minute they walk in the front door
9359863 ask your child to hang out and then casually ask if anything happened in math class
9359864 how was school is kind of abstract for a child and they dont really understand what you want to know
9359865 ask more specific questions such as did you see suzy today or did you play tag during recess
9359866 just talk about your day chat with them about what you did or what daddy did or ask them about their teacher because it is sometimes easier and safer for children to talk about other people than themselves
9359867 many older kids today communicate by text message or e mails and if your child is one of them this may be a very valuable way to communicate with him or her
9359868 if your child will only give you one word answers dont drive yourself crazy or try to force your children to talk because that wont do anyone any good
9359869 if you like green tomatoes you will like this recipe all my friends and family love it

9359871 if you just sit in a chair all day and feel sorry for yourself your lung function is only going to get worse
9359872 exercise is an integral part of the treatment of copd
9359873 for starters it reduces shortness of breath which means patients can do more and go further without getting short of breath
9359874 im feeling better than i have in a long time
9359875 exercise keeps your airways open and when you have copd everything starts closing up so its vitally important that you get out and move
9359876 i advise patients to build up to exercising three or four days a week for at least 20 minutes at a time
9359877 if they also need to lose weight i recommend exercising for longer periods of time
9359878 the whole key is to exert yourself a little bit
9359879 i may not be able to do a lot of the physical stuff that i used to
9359880 but we still go places and there is a lot i can do
9359881 there is no more room for their lungs to expand
9359882 the only way they get air in and out is to breathe fast and shallow
9359883 yoga can help people with copd concentrate on their breathing and breathing patterns and learn to control the respiratory muscles and decrease the anxiety surrounding being short of breath
9359884 i am comfortable with who i am and confident that with good advice i can find the right path ahead
9359885 with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and a lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations
9359886 i am comfortable with who i am and confident that with good advice i can find the right path ahead

9359888 its so nice to go somewhere where you do not have to explain to anyone why youre an elvis fan
9359889 why all of us want to know so much about this one man is still a mystery to me but we go because its like a family reunion and we all just feel closer to elvis at graceland
9359890 its the most unique historic home tour youll find anywhere in the world
9359891 at other historic properties you might hear someone impersonating the voice of a president but our tour offers you the opportunity to hear from the people who lived there not only elvis but also priscilla and lisa marie and you can listen to recordings of gladys and vernon and elvis singing when youre actually hearing the people who lived and breathed inside those walls it becomes a very real place
9359892 when the ladies are in town if they wish to come out to the house they give the staff advance notice
9359893 well take down the ropes and roll out the white carpet to cover up the black tour path take the protective coverings off the things in the kitchen and the house becomes a home again if its christmas priscilla and lisa marie will sit on the furniture in the jungle room and open presents this is where lisa marie grew up so its very much a special place for her

9359900 a for a motriz direta da sensibilidade e do sentimento
9359901 o artista se aproxima da pintura como se vislumbrasse mudan as sutis em cores imagin rias e tivesse o intuito de registr las no suporte antes que sumissem deste horizonte alguma coisa de inalcan vel que ele deseja fixar
9359902 e o faz em pinturas silenciosas tonais nas quais aqui e ali um novo elemento uma pincelada t til ou uma cor mais vibrante se colocasse como par metro de um novo di logo uma compara o entre dois mundos
9359903 estamos trabalhando forte para produzir plantas mais resistentes a altas temperaturas e pouca gua a nova variedade ser entre 30 e 40 mais tolerante estiagem do que as que existem hoje no mercado
9359904 quando a planta precisa de gua ela ativa esse gene e ele por sua vez ativa os genes pertencentes planta de soja que v o dar prote o maior contra a perda de gua
9359905 plantio direto associado a leguminosas rota o de culturas aprofundamento do sistema reticular que facilita a infiltra o de gua no solo para cada solo e cada regi o s o constantemente divulgados e incentivados
9359906 diferentemente da soja e do milho que voc perde a cultura e s vai poder plantar de novo no ano seguinte
9359907 quando chover vai chover muito e a seca vai ser mais forte
9359908 a raiz do milho mais profunda deixa a terra mais macia e facilita a penetra o da gua no solo quando chove ent o segura mais a umidade
9359909 antigamente a chuva era certa em determinados per odos agora varia muito n o tem mais l gica nem de poca nem de quantidade uma chuva de 40 mil metros deixava o solo mido por um bom tempo agora em poucos dias j fica tudo seco

9359913 nosso regi o tem clima de montanha mas esse ano fez 35 graus em janeiro e fevereiro
9359914 frio e seca nos meses de fevereiro e mar o impediram o caf de florar
9359915 como o caf uma cultura perene de longo prazo os produtores ainda t m um pouco de receio de substituir a planta o por novas variedades mas se as mudan as continuarem se intensificando no futuro esse deve ser um caminho
9359916 o calor cada vez mais intenso aumentou os problemas com pragas e doen as no caf
9359917 vivemos em uma regi o privilegiada com altitude alta mesmo assim j poss vel perceber um aumento da temperatura de quatro anos para c a temperatura em agosto n o passava de 25 graus nesse ano registramos 30 graus

9359919 we speelden een goede match we hebben een aantal kansen gecre erd en scoorden daaruit 4 keer dat bulykin twee keer scoort is voor ons een opsteker
9359920 ik had hem gezegd dat hij in de box voor zijn man moest proberen te komen en dat ik de ballen daar ging proberen te droppen het is een goed aanspeelpunt hij is hetzelfde type als frutos een sterk kopspel en hij kan de bal heel goed bijhouden

9359924 we hebben grote kansen gemist in het begin zonder goed te spelen
9359925 na de eerste twee goals was het moeilijkste voorbij bulykin was gevaarlijk voor doel en als hij scoort mag hij voetballend wat minder zijn
9359926 toda a vez que os vizinhos me enxergavam recolhendo caf corriam pra fazer a mesma coisa porque vinha chuva
9359927 quando arma uma chuva longe e o rel mpago sobe no c u porque a chuva vai chegar logo agora se o rel mpago muda de dire o e vai mais de lado por causa do vento porque a chuva vai passar longe daqui

9359941 bohemian styling and classic tailoring the mix of formal and casual silhouettes romantic colors and subtle texture evokes a hazy spring day in eastern europe
9359942 spring 09 is my take on futuristic streetwear where boundaries are erased shapes are gender ambiguous but inherently masculine and fabrics are a juxtaposition of steely fabrics with soft yarns
9359943 our key theme is postpunk english counterculture fashion from jamaican rudeboy to british skinhead
9359944 the iraqi army still wants to enter khanaqin and the peshmerga is present everyone is on edge
9359945 if the iraqi army tries to enter without prior agreement we cant be held responsible for the consequences
9359946 a week ago the iraqi army surrounded khanaqin this was illogical khanaqin is stable and there is no security breach
9359947 the presence of peshmerga in diyala is just like the presence of an outlaw militia
9359948 peshmerga forces have been martyred in the region in the name of stability and security
9359949 in order to promote this dignity in an integral way so called christianophobia should be combated as decisively as islamophobia and anti semitism
9359950 i have never seen persecution so bad in my life and i have seen a lot of opposition to the gospel over the years
9359951 we have brought to the city peshmerga forces and weapons and we have taken all necessary measures to face any resistance

9359958 pica pica special to me because i participated in designing its brand identity even before it was born
9359959 thus our kiosk is the product of a design evolution which has remained consistent with its design theme and product concept laid down by litlit through this process we have developed a teamwork which has given us what we want in terms of product development while at the same time retaining our consistency in terms of our design theme
9359960 pica pica started with the right mindset in terms of design from the very beginning it had its own visual identity
9359961 its unlike most local brands who starts first with producing and distributing the product and worrying about the design later in pica picas case the design was born together with the product
