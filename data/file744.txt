7440000 but once those triggers rise above the threshold migraine becomes activated and symptoms occur
7440001 the degree of symptoms depends on how high above the threshold your triggers are
7440002 i used to have migraines and some medicines made me sicker than the headache
7440003 this is a nondrug treatment for bad headaches thats why its important
7440004 the bottom line from my perspective is that its best to prevent it rather than to walk around with some expensive hardware to zap yourself every time you get an aura
7440005 younger children are more likely to fall their judgment and depth perception are not developed and they are very impulsive once the stairs are there they dont necessarily go down the way they came up
7440006 unless you are watching your kids every minute they can climb up on the bunk bed and in a matter of seconds fall
7440007 younger kids think they can fly they put on a superman cape and jump if the cape gets caught on a rail it could be deadly they could hang themselves
7440008 how long did it take phelps to eat all this
7440009 are the conventions scripted are they planned of course but this year theyre also exciting and historic
7440010 this is the first time since 1952 that we havent had an incumbent president or vice president on either side what we have is two candidates who bring an enormous amount of excitement to their candidacies so maybe were old fashioned but we are going to be there and on the air more than we were in 2004
7440011 they didnt suddenly get religion during the last four years what they got are ratings and profits
7440012 the networks made money off the primary campaigns in 2008 for the first time in many many elections and they want to try to continue to cash in
7440013 our job is to cover the news and there is without a question less and less news at the conventions
7440014 it is an enormous expenditure of money to cover these conventions the way we cover them and i would rather that we consider whether we should take the money that is shorter and shorter in all media and use it to cover the campaign
7440015 first i think we were all surprised by the amount of interest in the debates during the primary season which exceeded our estimates and i think were all going on the assumption that there is still a good deal of interest in politics this year
7440016 we suspected this would be an unbelievable political year but i dont think any us had any sense how intense the interest would be to the degree that several million people would come to watch our big events whether primary coverage or the debates
7440017 we know our core audience is a politically minded audience that wants this story and loves this story
7440018 we have all our resources and collective brainpower focused on this story it begins our signature time for the network to own this political story
7440019 the question i keep getting asked by people who are writing stories about convention coverage is why are you bothering whats the big deal arent they old fashioned havent they outlived their purpose
7440020 and i am always coming back saying this is the end of the most exciting campaign in my lifetime why wouldnt you want to be there for it why would you want to hang onto your seat every tuesday night for months through the primaries and then ho hum the convention where it crowns the winner

7440022 behavioral targeting companies in china are just starting up i dont think many people have figured out the essence of behavior targeting and especially how it can be applied to the current china market and even in the states it is only recently starting to get real momentum in terms of proving it yields better roi creating robust profiles and algorithms etc
7440023 1 we have the demonstrated success from the u s and 2 the chinese have proven to be quicker to adopt now new advertising techniques as was evidenced with search marketing

7440026 i was a lot better defensive coach when i was at oklahoma
7440027 were still fighting the battle for respect with the east coast bias
7440028 it showed what we could do but theres a lot more work to be done
7440029 i was like this since i was a little boy
7440030 they said i had add when i was a kid and tried to put me on ritalin my mom wouldnt let them
7440031 coach im ready come on coach put me in there i remind him we have guys for that we need him to do what he does
7440032 we allowed small mistakes in the games missed tackle here blown assignment there to build and it added up to losses weve learned
7440033 i tell coach hey put me in if you want to score or at least let me block
7440034 it seems like johjima and adrian beltre cant seem to get a break
7440035 he hits balls that off the bat you are thinking double and the next thing you know theyve got him its very frusterating for a hitter to go through that
7440036 i guess the grass was kind of wet too and it kind of slid and took off it was nice to get a clutch hit and help the team get a win
7440037 i come prepared everyday thats all i have in mind
7440038 i dont prepare myself to be a backup either i wake up at the same time and i eat at the same time as well i prepare for the game the same way
7440039 he came up big defensively for us he and willie bloomquist have been kind of like that for the ball club all year just two really valuable pieces that if we had been winning more ball games i think everybody would really recognize how valuable those guys are
7440040 i havent won a game for a long time and it feels great
7440041 ive got to go out there and do the best i can again and try to win another one
7440042 the entire working culture has been destroyed because people have been receiving their food rations each day and no longer know how to earn a living independently
7440043 helping the people to re establish their lives in a psychological cultural and spiritual sense as well
7440044 they have seen their children kidnapped their sisters mothers daughters and wives raped and their fellow humans murdered
7440045 future priests have actually shared the experiences of the people themselves
7440046 my grandfather has taught me to work hard to stay true to my responsibilities to do more than whats asked and to be involved in the community
7440047 they can strengthen their cognitive artistic emotional leadership and higher education skills youth who are creative resilient educated and active citizens are youth who benefit themselves their families and our community now and in the future
7440048 this year i tried to tiptoe around my personal life but i ended up doing a project just as intense as the story i published last year i couldnt escape doing this

7440085 obviously that is a lot slower than what you had in 2007
7440086 the reason being is global economic slowdown higher commodity prices and tightening of monetary policy on the part of the central bank
7440087 private consumption will remain in the drivers seat supported by robust remittances
7440088 domestic demand will emerge as the saviour of growth as external demand suffers due to global slowdown prospects and elevated commodity prices

7440093 we hope for peace and stability so that affected families in mindanao can soon return to their homes and begin rebuilding their lives
7440094 in the current unpredictable security situation vulnerable victims of these clashes urgently need to receive humanitarian assistance especially essential food among other complimentary relief items
7440095 wfp fully understands that the situation remains fluid and we will continue to work closely with all concerned to further assess the total number of affected persons and adjust our response accordingly
7440096 wfp remains concerned over the growing number of persons displaced by the violence between the armed forces and the milf many of the affected population are women and children and we are concerned for their well being and stand ready to support humanitarian needs
7440097 the secretary general is concerned about the unfolding humanitarian crisis as a result of fighting in central mindanao an area which has already been affected by conflict for several decades
7440098 mr ban appealed for restraint protection of all civilians as well as access for the provision of speedy humanitarian assistance to the affected population and stated the uns readiness to support the efforts of the government of the philippines in this regard

7440102 with an rba rate cut cycle imminent that should continue to weigh on the australian dollar as well as the stronger us dollar and weaker commodity price trends
7440103 were not expecting the us dollar to continue to appreciate at the pace weve seen in the past month but were looking for it to strengthen over the medium term
7440104 it is outrageous that binyam mohamed who is being held and charged by the united states has to go to a british court to get potentially exculpatory information about his treatment
7440105 the british foreign secretary should immediately disclose to mohameds lawyers any and all evidence it has about his interrogation and detention
7440106 if you look at the different rivers of nairobi you will see trash that is harmful to human health frequent outbreaks of common diseases are due to this trash diseases like malaria cholera and others are all caused by this trash many people live in places that are unfit for human habitation the sources of rivers passing through nairobi are very clean but when they approach the city they become dirty because a lot trash is dumped into them

7440111 although a two state solution in which an independent palestine would emerge is supported by most governments israels apparent refusal to discuss the final status of jerusalem the right of return of palestinian refugees and fair sharing of water resources continues to block progress
7440112 we should celebrate in spite of all the hardships going back to school
7440113 education is a lifeline a much needed semblance of normalcy
7440114 framed by conflict occupation and the fast growing poverty around them
7440115 in recent years israel and the municipality invested tens of millions to make the east jerusalem education system an advanced and leading one
7440116 milf units that targeted villages have engaged in serious violations of international law and should be held to account
7440117 but experience from around the world shows that the deployment of civilian militias can set off a chain of reprisals and only increases the danger facing civilians
7440118 all sides to this conflict should step back from the brink and demonstrate their commitment to avoid harming civilians the milf must control its forces and the philippine government should take responsibility for the security of all peoples in the philippines regardless of religion or ethnicity
7440119 we have to protect ourselves the military could not warrant our safety they come late
7440120 the recent violent attacks by milf elements have of course shaken many of mindanaos residents who have every right to demand greater protection
7440121 many people in mindanao are terrified of a return to a period when armed muslim insurgents and christian vigilante ilaga groups attacked civilians with impunity
7440122 despite the economic headwinds affecting the industry we are on track to sell more vehicles than we did last year and 2007 was already a record year for us
7440123 at a time when consumers are more hesitant in their purchasing decisions it is even more crucial to have convincing products

7440132 this is a club with a future it is the most charitable in the world it plays good football i think in this sense we have worked rigorously successfully and i say this humbly with talent

7440134 i didnt even know the dnc was in town i dont watch the news
7440135 if i had known i would have done things differently it was a simple mistake
7440136 what i feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation backed by money
7440137 a channel that becomes home of the best programme makers the best writers the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience
7440138 uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment but on a big rather than timid scale
7440139 whatever the bbc says and does it will get it in the neck
7440140 lets take a wager that the bbc brand is the best tv brand in the world that people will pay for that brand
7440141 let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the british television industry the best in the world can do
7440142 theres too much at stake too vital a contribution to our culture to let its critics start to pull it apart now i want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has more specifically i want it to plug a gap i still see in the british tv market one which once filled can give the individual programme maker the impetus to make the distinctive the surprising the lavish the intimate the experimental unhampered by the constraints the bbc normally has to operate under

7440195 i think we stand apart from the other companies in this competition because of the toy recall issue in america
7440196 there were 22 million toy recalls from china in 2007 alone so theres a demand for games that are safe for us and the environment
7440197 i like that were doing something that lots of other game companies could be doing

7440231 questa sera come appassionato di calcio ho apprezzato ogni cosa la prestazione dellinter quella della roma e anche quella della terna arbitrale non sembrava una partita di calcio dagosto le squadre si sono date battaglia per oltre due ore giocando con ritmo e intensit ha spiegato alla fine mourinho apparso molto soddisfatto per la vittoria siamo riusciti a mettere in pratica quanto preparato in settimana pressing alto sulla fonte del loro gioco mi piaciuta molto anche la reazione finale della squadra che ha portato al gol di balotelli lunica cosa fuori contesto stata la loro seconda rete la squadra ha dimostrato di essere psicologicamente molto forte e tatticamente compatta questo un grande gruppo un gruppo eccezionale
7440232 se ho potuto vincere questa supercoppa perch un allenatore prima di me ha vinto lo scudetto con linter per questo motivo credo e sia giusto in questa occasione dedicare un pensiero a roberto capitato anche a me in passato di essere nella sua situazione di oggi ho vinto la champions con il porto e poi grazie a questo successo quando io ero gi al chelsea il porto ha potuto giocare la supercoppa europea e la coppa intercontinentale nessuno allora si ricordato di me io invece voglio ricordare roberto che allinter ha fatto un ottimo lavoro e ha vinto tanto
7440233 mi piaciuta la duttilit con la quale muntari si adattato al modulo della squadra oggi ha segnato e ha avuto altre tre o quattro occasione da rete se questa linter di mourinho la mia inter quella che gioca meglio dellavversario e vince tre a zero

7440280 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7440281 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7440282 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7440283 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7440284 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7440285 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions

7440289 i would explain to him that i dont do this with male friends i came here because you invited me however now that im here i feel a little uncomfortable

7440295 the december election is not about whether you are a fante or an akyem it is about the future development of our nation that is why you have to reject politicians who are playing the ethnic card and want you to vote for them because they are from this or that region that is not correct that is dangerous for the nations unity because we are all one people with a common destiny tribal politics is backward and reactionary we want progressive politics of unity and oneness we are moving forward

7440306 peka sangat berbeda jauh dengan angkak persamaannya peka juga dipakai sebagai bumbu masak khusus peka sifatnya sebagai pewangi masakan
7440307 nah saya melihat angkak ini mempunyai sifat hangat dan manis yang berarti mempunyai fungsi tonifikasi atau menyejukkan padahal penyakit menular dalam hal ini demam berdarah bersifat panas lembab
7440308 dengan kata lain pemakaian angkak untuk pengobatan tidak bisa digunakan sendiri harus didukung oleh obat tradisional lainnya yang mempunyai sifat yang telah disebutkan di atas menyejukkan dan menghilangkan hawa lembab

7440310 these lads have taken a lot of punishment from kerry over the last number of years counihan said shortly after the full time whistle on sunday
7440311 there were times out there when they were on top of us that we could have folded up the tent and capitulated again but we display tremendous character in not throwing in the towel and that has to count for something
7440312 once we have that in the tank there is always a possibility of winning and that keeps players going
7440313 the reality of the situation from my point of view is that some of our players under performed again out there today and its something well have to address before the replay we have room for improvement and the players will know that themselves
7440314 i have to admit that we were fortunate enough to get the draw we didnt play well on the day i recall saying to the selectors when we were six points down and two minutes left to play that we needed two goals if were to extricate ourselves out of this game
7440315 listening to the liverpool match against middlesbrough on saturday id be a bit of a fan they needed two goals if they were to win the game late and they got them
7440316 i remember saying to one of the lads that that is a sign of a team that is mentally strong the team that gets one goal back rises a bit while the opposition becomes a bit rattled
7440317 similarly thats what happened here james got a goal and then we pushed on looking for another and that came from a penalty so as long as there is time left there is hope setanta readers comment of the day
7440318 weve got three medals in boxing we had hoped for more but well done to boxing but we have also had some fantastic performance in other events

7440332 the abrupt recovery in the dollar can only be explained by a widening investment view that america may offer the least worst haven right now whatever the wisdom of that attitude the higher dollar has also knocked metals back probably to levels at which buying certainly in gold given that inflation remains a threat everywhere might return rather sooner than later

7440338 ja hallo hier ist metzger ich wollt mich mal was erkundigen
7440339 wegen den sargtr gern h tt ich gern mal eine sorge
7440340 ja ich wollt mich mal wissen wieviele sargtr ger da bermorgen da sind wissen sie wir sitzen hier im engsten familienkreis und diskutieren uns wegen denen sargtr gern
7440341 aha also da werden vier sargtr ger kommen die bestattung ist auf dem st dtischen friedhof und die stadt stellt immer genau vier sargtr ger
7440342 ja also das geht nicht so wir haben uns hier die meinung da der sarg dann falsch ist sie haben uns da falsch beraten getan
7440343 wir waren heute bei die omma gegange und haben gesehn dass der sarg sechs griffe hat wenn aber nur vier tr ger da kommen dann sind ja zwei griffe leer
7440344 das macht doch nichts besser zwei zuviel als zwei zuwenig
7440345 nee da mein schwagers meinung die von meiner frau und mir das geht so nicht
7440346 tja was sollen wir denn jetzt ihrer meinung nach tun wir k nnten uns bem hen noch zwei sargtr ger zu besorgen
7440347 nein die omma war sich ja ganz klein und leicht das m ssen sie doch wissen da sind sich sechs tr ger unn tig k nnen sie die griffe nicht wegmachen
7440348 erstens m sste man die innenbespannung an der stelle l sen damit man von innen am die schrauben kommt zweitens h tte man dann h liche l cher an den seitenw nden
7440349 gut wir entfernen die griffe aber ich garantiere nicht da man nicht doch eventuell die stellen sieht wo vorher die l cher waren
7440350 warum denn nicht gleich so wir sitzen hier so da und haben sorgen
7440351 ach noch ne frage h tt ich dann mal gern
7440352 vielleicht hat die omma doch noch watt zugenommen wir nehmen dann sechs tr ger ja
7440353 watt is denn teurer odder mal ganz andersherum gefragt watt t t uns denn am billigsten kommen

7440364 a vote for the anc is a vote for zuma
7440365 there are a lot of opportunities in zimbabwe for south african companies which are best placed to take advantage but they obviously will need to proceed in an informed and cautious way
7440366 zimbabwe is a country which has potential and as soon as there is stability clearly we would be reviewing our investment strategy it is a country that is definitely on our radar screen
7440367 while zimbabwes economy has declined sharply over the past decade it still has good infrastructure which we believe will form the basis of renewed economic growth once the political situation is resolved
7440368 south african companies are already heavily involved in zimbabwes platinum industry for example implats and angloplat their ability to process product is an advantage theres no reason south african companies should lose out to us or chinese investors if the project and investment make sense
7440369 no major investment will take place until a new government seriously tackles hyperinflation and reforms the economy this situation is so serious this cannot be done easily by zimbabwe alone but will require international capital support this is unlikely to come from sa russia or china but as ever from the us and europe they will have their own conditions before that support will be forthcoming
7440370 we see continued margin pressure but the upside is the favourable demographic trend
7440371 we have established a platform for organic growth and the capacity to fund it
7440372 we have a number of leases that derive benefit from the underlying performance of certain of the hotels where you had a good performance in terms of hotel operations this comes through as stronger growth in rentals
7440373 occupancies are stable and theres still an overall shortage of supply
7440374 obviously the economy generally is showing signs of stress but i think our portfolio is particularly focused quite heavily on the corporate market rather than the leisure market and demand from the corporate market is likely to remain strong for the foreseeable future
7440375 our prices on basic supermarket commodities are now highly competitive
7440376 but bringing food prices down is not enough we needed to do other things because things were boiling we think the full lag impact of higher interest rates is not yet through it is going to take some time

7440386 the power to this message is that youre using the democrats own words
7440387 the mccain guys have successfully used the rapid response to set the terms of the debate on the eve of the democrats convention
7440388 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7440389 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
7440390 this is very much a personal view at this stage
7440391 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7440392 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem
7440393 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7440394 it just adds further trouble particularly this one because most of the people affected would be families that are already struggling because they are on welfare
7440395 to cut them off will only cause further homelessness problems and further family conflict
7440396 there has to be what you would describe as reasonable grounds for being absent
7440397 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in
7440398 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7440399 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7440400 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognise the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted

7440421 there are safety and security issues in just about every country in the world that we play with the exception of new zealand
7440422 professional risk assessment says the risk is acceptable in some of those places unfortunately at the moment its not acceptable in pakistan
7440423 what were all desperately hoping now is the situation in pakistan settles down and allows us to go back there next year we havent had a senior australian team in pakistan for a long time
7440424 i think thats an unfair observation about players basically the safety and security advice weve got about india is completely different to the safety and security advice weve got about pakistan
7440425 its simple if the expert advice says its safe we go and were happy to recommend to players that we go
7440426 if the safety and security advice says its not safe then we dont go and our track record speaks for itself on that front
7440427 we really hope the situation in pakistan improves to the extent where they can tour
7440428 i think as a nation south africa is facing mount everest right now the top of our mountain is really that positive idea of what we want south africa to look like i think if were filled with hope for a positive outcome we are far more likely to change the circumstances we are in right now every south african has the potential to make a huge difference and together if we do that we can get to the top of our everest

7440466 hes a velocity guy a 92 to 95 guy and when you see him dip underneath 90 thats cause for concern only he knows the answer
7440467 it would be to our benefit for millar to go up there and hit one out

7440481 i made it through every single lay off through the hurwitz years only to get cut at the end
7440482 i saw first hand how hurwitz took a vibrant great company that cared for its employees community and its lands and watched as he sucked it dry like a parasite drilling into a healthy body and leaving behind a dried mummified husk
7440483 if hurwitz had never come along the fortuna mill would have still been running there would have never been a carlotta mill acquisition the majority of our timber would still be there and there would be around 800 people with great jobs and great benefits

7440507 they the springboks scored zip against the all blacks at newlands the first time south africa went pointless at home since 1903 people called it a joke but de villiers didnt think so no serious coach would two years ago whites boks were humiliated 49 0 by the wallabies in brisbane some thought that was joke too a year later they won the rugby world cup
7440508 the truth of the matter is that de villiers has only been effectively coaching the springboks for four months now the springboks got together for the first time in may after the super 14 barely enough time to objectively judge his ability as a coach at the highest level of the game

7440516 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7440517 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7440518 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7440522 c tait courir plus vite quusain bolt sur 100m battre michael phelps sur 200 m papillon ou marquer un panier de plus que les basketteurs us
7440523 la m daille dor de tia hellebaut et celle dargent du relais 4x100 m f minin sont deux preuves suppl mentaires que la belgique sportive doit beaucoup ses
7440524 tia hellebaut appartient ce club tr s ferm des comp titeurs hors pair en compagnie de quelques autres champions belges comme eddy merckx ou fr d ric deburghgraeve par exemple tia hellebaut poss de ce m lange de talent de force mentale dintelligence et dadresse qui lorsquon les met en pratique aux instants cruciaux dune comp tition vous propulsent vers les sommets
7440525 tia hellebaut a d jou tous les pronostics tia hellebaut va devenir une star part enti re elle l tait d j au regard de son palmar s championne deurope outdoor et indoor et championne du monde du pentathlon mais par rapport kim gevaert ou justine henin elle tait l g rement en retrait par sa personnalit timide et sa discipline le saut en hauteur moins expos e que le sprint ou le tennis
7440526 jamais encore une athl te belge navait glan une m daille dor aux jeux tia hellebaut a donc sign un exploit en simposant au saut en hauteur avec une fille en or et quatre autres en argent le sport belge nest plus hors jeux
7440527 notre championne olympique de la hauteur fait lunanimit pour ses qualit s humaines
7440528 la plus belle performance dun jour jamais r alis e dans le sport f minin belge
7440529 un grand saut pour tia un petit pas pour notre image

7440539 we are receiving reports of catastrophic flooding and debris in parts of the state
7440540 we are trying to anticipate the needs that will be arising in the next few days
7440541 this is unprecedented in terms of the slow nature of this storm the large circulation and the fact that its impacted probably about 90 per cent of the state with heavy rains and severe weather
7440542 est estable aunque tiene hematomas heridas y escoriaciones en la boca es probable que la hayan arrastrado

7440544 weve got three medals in boxing we had hoped for more but well done to boxing but we have also had some fantastic performance in other events
7440545 we had eoin rheinisch in the canoeing who was fourth and excellent walking results paul hession superseded his targets and in the pool we set two national records
7440546 we had our first ever victory in a badminton match our eventing team was eighth and wed some wins in the sailing
7440547 these lads have taken a lot of punishment from kerry over the last number of years counihan said shortly after the full time whistle on sunday
7440548 there were times out there when they were on top of us that we could have folded up the tent and capitulated again but we display tremendous character in not throwing in the towel and that has to count for something
7440549 once we have that in the tank there is always a possibility of winning and that keeps players going
7440550 the reality of the situation from my point of view is that some of our players under performed again out there today and its something well have to address before the replay we have room for improvement and the players will know that themselves
7440551 i have to admit that we were fortunate enough to get the draw we didnt play well on the day i recall saying to the selectors when we were six points down and two minutes left to play that we needed two goals if were to extricate ourselves out of this game
7440552 listening to the liverpool match against middlesbrough on saturday id be a bit of a fan they needed two goals if they were to win the game late and they got them
7440553 i remember saying to one of the lads that that is a sign of a team that is mentally strong the team that gets one goal back rises a bit while the opposition becomes a bit rattled
7440554 similarly thats what happened here james got a goal and then we pushed on looking for another and that came from a penalty so as long as there is time left there is hope setanta readers comment of the day
7440555 one of the most powerful pamphlets ever written in australia
7440556 racism and the highly evolved strategies that some white australians use to dismiss obstruct and trivialise aboriginal people are like a virus just when you think you have inoculated yourself against it another version of the attack hits you when you are unprepared germaine greers astonishing attack on me in her slight essay on rage struck me as one of these mutant attacks it is a cleverly disguised but nonetheless racist attack on aboriginal people some will find this conclusion shocking but let me explain the conclusions she wants us to draw from her essay and her many media appearances are threefold the aboriginal population and the many indigenous societies from which the rapidly growing australian indigenous population is drawn now about 500 000 people is not viable aboriginal males are so crippled by what she calls rage they cannot recover aboriginal women notably myself have contributed to their downfall that further belittles them taken as a whole her arguments are racist they are also just plain wrong
7440557 i just cant forget what he did to me its rushing back to me these memories
7440558 i dont know why he did it i met the wrong person thats all
7440559 a lot of women get hit from their husband but i dont know why im really happy he went to jail for a long time he kept me away from all my family my family is happy hes gone away
7440560 it will take me a while to get better i want to move on and find another life i dont want to have another husband i just want to be myself
7440561 it is clear that you are a violent bully with no respect for women and no respect also i might add for orders of the courts
7440562 i havent seen the video but people were still running other races rick had to scream over 91 000 fans over the photographers over the other athletes the microphone makes it sound tenfold it reminds me of reality tv where they only show the sensational stuff and cut things out afterward the announcers didnt help it started a snowball effect
7440563 theyre hammering my coach when you attack my coach you attack me too
7440564 its a relationship a coach and an athlete thats the part that bothered me we have worked so hard to come this far and theyre pinpointing one person its two people its unfortunate that the cameras didnt see the celebration afterward or the encouragement he gives me
7440565 he told me that was the end of it i was kind of upset with myself i had four tries to make a bar and did the same thing four times id done it at my last meet too i had promised myself going in not to lose a takeoff and slow down at the box and i did for me it was frustrating
7440566 what he said was true in a way it made me feel better it wasnt malicious it was what i did wrong it was actually a positive thing he told me id won silver
7440567 i just hope that some day i can walk down the streets of fredonia with my coach and have people congratulate us both
7440568 i want to make sure people understand how thankful i am for all their support i dont want it to seem otherwise
7440569 people dont understand this is my job i pay rick to be my coach and to tell me whats wrong he tells me when im good and he tells me when im bad i asked what i did wrong and he told me im 26 years old i can think for myself im a strong girl my parents raised me to be strong and i was not even remotely sad that night

7440585 the muttering you hear is that she has a little too much edge
7440586 shes too smart and too accomplished to stand out there and smile for 15 minutes the challenge is to get up there smooth and charming and not have too much attitude

7440628 it would also consist of indian origin collections like the dance inspired collection being promoted by bipasha basu dhoni 7 collection designed with inputs from ms dhoni himself and fish fry for reebok designed by manish arora
7440629 reebok has been there in the lifestyle space for quite some time now and we started off by foraying into lifestyle last year with niche initiatives like fish fry for reebok by manish arora and launch of some very stylish collections like dj shoes and canvas collection
7440630 daughter cell gene expression is special and now we know why
7440631 most people would go to rats and mice for lab testing but when it comes to testing new wound therapies or products and cosmetics that go on human skin pig skin is our closest alternative and is most often used
7440632 however this is expensive the test numbers are limited and of course there are ethical problems to consider so using a human skin equivalent will reduce this use and possibly give more accurate results
7440633 obviously the ultimate goal is to avoid labs having to use animals altogether eventually
7440634 the skin is then processed in our laboratory to isolate the cells once they are growing healthily again we can bring them back together and create the multi component skin equivalent in the lab
7440635 finding artifacts such as this one during experiments isnt uncommon but we decided to investigate this one further since we kept observing it over and over when we sequenced it were surprised to learn that we found a new virus
7440636 our initiative comes out of our keenness to help ibdaa recognise this new generation of pioneering artists the restrictions placed on mobile phone video makers from the size of the image to the possible length of takes represent exciting new possibilities

7440638 they have enabled spammers to push down their costs through economies of scale and eliminated the need for spammers to host their own spam servers as they simply take control of other peoples computers instead

7440646 hit some big home runs and the walks made the difference
7440647 it was a mental mistake jack does a great job of putting us up and the biggest thing is the first out and i walk johjima and bryan lahair one hit and its all of a sudden a totally different ballgame
7440648 every time we got some runs i would go back out and give it back
7440649 as a starting pitcher thats a terrible feeling to have

7440668 this initiative will save paper save time and make use of the information super highway
7440669 and since we wont have to update texts every couple of years the information we use from the net will always be up to date and relevent to each field offered at our national media marketing school
7440670 this aspect of our curriculum will really prepare students for the real world
7440671 and we believe it will help them gain meaningful employment after graduation
7440672 im thrilled that my son will have the opportunity to attend this school which really looks promising when i graduated from the mohamad needleman private school i was really clueless about the real world this national media marketing school looks much different it is the real world and promises to teach our kids how to be productive citizens no matter what career path they may follow
7440673 weve worked hard for almost five years now planning organizing and developing what we think will be the nations best national media marketing learning center the next obvious step was to build it and get students through the doors which will not be any trouble whatsoever
7440674 this project is vast but will be very beneficial to our youth

7440690 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
7440691 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again

7440693 are the conventions scripted are they planned of course but this year theyre also exciting and historic
7440694 this is the first time since 1952 that we havent had an incumbent president or vice president on either side what we have is two candidates who bring an enormous amount of excitement to their candidacies so maybe were old fashioned but we are going to be there and on the air more than we were in 2004
7440695 they didnt suddenly get religion during the last four years what they got are ratings and profits
7440696 the networks made money off the primary campaigns in 2008 for the first time in many many elections and they want to try to continue to cash in
7440697 our job is to cover the news and there is without a question less and less news at the conventions
7440698 it is an enormous expenditure of money to cover these conventions the way we cover them and i would rather that we consider whether we should take the money that is shorter and shorter in all media and use it to cover the campaign
7440699 first i think we were all surprised by the amount of interest in the debates during the primary season which exceeded our estimates and i think were all going on the assumption that there is still a good deal of interest in politics this year
7440700 we suspected this would be an unbelievable political year but i dont think any us had any sense how intense the interest would be to the degree that several million people would come to watch our big events whether primary coverage or the debates
7440701 we know our core audience is a politically minded audience that wants this story and loves this story
7440702 we have all our resources and collective brainpower focused on this story it begins our signature time for the network to own this political story
7440703 the question i keep getting asked by people who are writing stories about convention coverage is why are you bothering whats the big deal arent they old fashioned havent they outlived their purpose
7440704 and i am always coming back saying this is the end of the most exciting campaign in my lifetime why wouldnt you want to be there for it why would you want to hang onto your seat every tuesday night for months through the primaries and then ho hum the convention where it crowns the winner
7440705 chronic pain affects a higher proportion of women than men but unfortunately they are also less likely to receive treatment compared to men due to various cultural economic and political barriers
7440706 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
7440707 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
7440708 men have to respect women but women have no reason to respect men
7440709 it takes time to persuade men to do even what is for their own good
7440710 that is why between now and 2010 we may not be able to attain universal access what we should do as a country is to define our universal access our own way to set realistic targets
7440711 the number of actors involved in iec information education and communication for behaviour change in the context of hiv aids prevention has decreased over the years currently only 17 percent of agencies implementing hiv aids interventions have a component for community sensitisation and education for prevention a fall from 78 per cent in 1997

7440749 if you are looking for a good time the conventions are still a good bet if youre a political insider
7440750 theres no question that they bring a lobbying agenda to these events and no question that they see this as part of their investment in building bridges to powerful policy makers
7440751 the parties have become tempting vehicles for all kinds of interests to have these slam dunk fish in a barrel opportunities to interact with important people
7440752 anyone who is concerned about the influence of money in politics should worry about any form of sponsorship of political activities that provide the sponsoring organization access to high level leaders
7440753 unfortunately parties have not found a way to finance conventions that does not raise this issue
7440754 its our view that every four years people around the globe are watching the u s and how we pick a leader
7440755 at amp ts role as a good corporate citizen is to showcase the elective process in the best light possible
7440756 as the conventions have meant less and less in terms of substance theyve become more of a forum for the interest groups
7440757 you see all the leaders from congress and the lobbyists and its a social setting so you can schmooze and theyre much looser about talking and confiding what they think
7440758 we have our hands full with the official party business that needs to happen each and every day
7440759 if the commission cant talk to the public we can
7440760 i hope they invite the school district redistricting commission to one of the forums
7440761 in the end people will see the wisdom in creating school districts that are organized k 12
7440762 i think its a bad idea for a lot of reasons
7440763 it will bring unbridled growth environmental degradation and unwanted change
7440764 the beauty of incorporation is that the people who live here make the decisions on growth and at what pace it will take place
7440765 i dont know how much of that will be filled with words as opposed to applause kidding kidding

7440769 during the time of the original streetcar it went everywhere worth going
7440770 it gave phoenix a very modern future looking system of public transportation
7440771 phoenix viewed the trolley system as making it a modern city
7440772 the trolley lines and the city grew at the same time and in the same direction
7440773 it pretty much went everywhere phoenixs population wanted to go and resided
7440774 you could get a flat wheel real easy if you stopped too fast
7440775 i think a great part of the reason the streetcar system ceased to operate was the automobile
7440776 even if the trolley had survived the fire of 1947 it would have been unable to keep up with the sprawling development of phoenix like automobile transportation

7440804 indians played a major role in the last general election hindraf played a major role but these heroes of hindraf were not recognised they should be honoured
7440805 we dont expect victory but 15 percent of the votes is like total rejection we must send a strong signal to the party that it has to be racially representative
7440806 the secretary general of the party has repeatedly urged the release of the hindraf detainees under the internal security act it is just that the party polls are highly competitive thats all
7440807 manoharan could not go out and campaign in the general election yet he won resoundingly how do you explain that

7440819 since the case is sub judice we cant comment as of now
7440820 however we registered the hari puttar title in 2005 and its unfortunate that warner has chosen to file a case so close to our films release in my opinion i dont think our title has any similarity or links with harry potter

7440826 we term it invertising invited advertising we think the blue ocean lies in enabling brands and businesses to build relationships with consumers on the mobile
7440827 to make it even more catchy consumers can be given incentives such as free talk time if they opt for ads
7440828 operator portal and sms advertising are just starting to happen mytoday has seen over 100 brands use the platform with over 30 percent of them repeating campaigns
7440829 the overall advertising opportunity is either text based such as sms or voice based such as branded caller tune or ring back tunes with ads
7440830 agencies and media planners are still taking time to understand the potential
7440831 cancer may reflect a partial and aberrant loss of differentiated character in which cells that were formerly specified to perform a specific task forget that and become more like the rapidly dividing stem cells from which they came
7440832 but this is cash money its a small boutique group of artists with a very similar fan base
7440833 theres a core group of consumers that associate with the specific cash money brand
7440834 i think hes inspirational and thats what this country needs right now
7440835 this is the first election where ive actually paid attention to every single thing and i think its because im a mom now
7440836 i just think barack is amazing i admire him i admire michelle
7440837 i had to stop saying why and understand that men that i adore so much dalai lama gandhi martin l king jr james baldwin and all the other heroes suffered some indignities in human relations far greater than i could ever imagine
7440838 these are the very guys i call my go to guys
7440839 so cowboy up take the hits grow from it learn from it and then understand it
7440840 i apologize to t r my colleagues the fans of the show and especially the lesbian and gay community for using a word that is unacceptable in any context or circumstance i can also no longer deny to myself that there are issues i obviously need to examine within my own soul and ive asked for help with one word ive hurt everyone who has struggled for the respect so many of us take for granted
7440841 im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore
7440842 but the more i felt i tried to fight to hold on i got a lot of advice from congresspersons and politicians who said you know this is not going to end the way you think its going to end you need to leave theyre just using you to do xyz to which washington replied no ive got enough credit ive been a good boy but i realize it wasnt about that it was time for me to go it was time for me to go on so many levels and none of them had to do with what i wanted because i wanted to do something that wasnt gods plan
7440843 the plan was you did what you set out to do this is what one of my mentors sidney poitier told me
7440844 dr burke became a brand the representation of the medical community
7440845 im not focused on africa im focused on sierra leone the place where i have my ancestral link
7440846 the only way africa can be developed is that the americans the africans in america at that time or the negroes have to come to the realization that we have to come together and start being a very prevalent and integral part of this continent
7440847 there is no way were going to be respected throughout the world as african americans theres no way were going to be treated with any sense of genuine if we continue to ignore this
7440848 its to raise 250 000 but not unlike senator barack obama it is to fund my efforts to change something in addition i have to cover operating costs which is minimal it also allows me to get on a plane and build seven water wells i can bring anderson coopers team and roland martin from cnn this money will fund breaking ground on 3 4 5 other schools and you can see it physically because i will have cnn there you will see us put a stake in the ground and say this is where a school is going to be
7440849 so many times people are donating their money to things and they dont see where it is going
7440850 thats when one deputy drew his weapon not knowing what the dudes were up to
7440851 were told at the time the weapon was drawn deputies did not know diddy was part of the group
7440852 im going to knock her out of her training bra
7440853 been liaising with the immigration department on snoops application which has been approved
7440854 snoop dogg trades in toxic messages of menace violence misogyny and lawlessness
7440855 to add to the fire hes actually had issues with firearms and drugs so not only does he portray and glorify these things in his music its exemplified in his real life we need to keep him out of australia these menacing blood soaked misogynist raps have a corrosive impact
7440856 i have been a fan of wyclefs for many years from his work with the fugees to his success as a solo artist
7440857 hes a fantastic writer singer producer and performer whose music crosses genres and touches peoples lives i am specially impressed by wyclefs dedication to humanitarian causes and his strong sense of character i was so happy to meet wyclef and work with him on our iconoclasts episode but not even in my wildest imagination did i expect that such a beautiful song would be one of the outcomes from meeting wyclef he is an amazing human being and it is truly an honor for me to be recognized in such a wonderful way by such a gifted musician and exceptional person
7440858 this is the last record under my def jam record label contract 13th record on a 13 album deal
7440859 it would be great if i could holler at phelps
7440860 and its a compliment that the man found inspiration in the music i do for the streets over here over there in beijing
7440861 phelps and his american rival ryan lochte who is also a fan of jeezy greet each other by saying juh in homage to the rapper a k a jay jenkins
7440862 his goofy grin dissolves into a glower his eyes turn cold as ice the hip hop beats have a hypnotic effect on phelps who sometimes after a race is unable to recall the songs that locked him into his groove
7440863 brighter days are here cuz we declare that history wont repeat
7440864 is not scheduled to be in the recording studio with britney
7440865 the proper function of man is to live not to exist i shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them i shall use my time
7440866 imagine all the trouble and fun i could cause all at once just with a text on my blackberry from me to them
7440867 and because i had so much fun doing this one i decided i need to find my new british bff everyone knows i love la but london watch out
7440868 when you have a three sector base station which is usual you would have 516mbps in a 20mhz environment
7440869 the challenge we have seen with wimax is it just hasnt gained that critical mass and i think a lot of that is driven by the lack of delivery against promises
7440870 given the new zealand and australian markets are so small we have to wait for the north american and european markets to drive the deployment of networks and most importantly the handsets datacards and laptops
7440871 clearly they are expecting to make some return on that i think that demonstrates the credibility of lte technology
7440872 it is all about outlook statements where you are hedged at in the future and where oil is going to end up
7440873 air new zealand is in a strong financial position has completed its fleet upgrade and has the leading product on all of its key routes
7440874 we are likely to see rising costs slowing traffic and increased competition in the coming months
7440875 couple this with hedging benefits rolling off potential for a higher us dollar and slowing traffic 2009 and 2010 could be two very hard years for air new zealand
7440876 a two tier internet in which websites with the best relationships with network providers can get the fastest access to consumers
7440877 an open marketplace with a variety of consumer choices is the best deterrent against unfair practices
7440878 as a country we have ensured that every american has access to a telephone service and electricity regardless of economic status and obama will do likewise for broadband internet access
7440879 affordable broadband with a specific focus on reaching previously unserved communities
7440880 let us be the generation that reshapes our economy to compete in the digital age
7440881 i drummed for alicias voice and she mimicked the guitar tones then we joined our voices and screamed and moaned about these characters in the film and their isolation having no one to trust not even themselves
7440882 after a couple of years of wanting to collaborate with alicia keys it took james bond himself to finally make it happen
7440883 alicia put some electric energy into her breath that cemented itself into the magnetic tape very inspiring to watch it gave me a new voice and i wasnt myself anymore
7440884 you can measure it in burglary rates obesity rates teenage pregnancy rates the impact is huge
7440885 we are going in to do budgeting with mothers who have 30 or 40 to try to feed their family for a week
7440886 theyll live on takeaways and chips which is unhealthy and expensive
7440887 thats the subject of enormous debate within the not for profit sector at the moment
7440888 churches can do things that for the government would be politically too risky
7440889 recently a church social services agency held a family camp for one of the major gangs a government agency directly funded would be too threatened by such an idea but the weekend was very successful and good things will come out of it for the families involved
7440890 you dont see the graffiti you used to theres been a lot of change
7440891 our performance continues to be underpinned by strong support from investors both domestically and offshore from intermediaries and share brokers institutional investors and borrowing clients he said
7440892 this ongoing support ensures we continue to strengthen our service offering we see excellent opportunities in these areas over the next 12 months
7440893 meanwhile we are enjoying the strongest inflows of new investment funds we have experienced in the past two years we are averaging 4 7m of new funds per week during the 2008 calendar year mcleod said
7440894 we have got to the stage where the level of allocation is at a point where we are at the sustainability limits of the resource
7440895 canterbury is one of the driest regions in all of new zealand so we need more water for productive purposes than anywhere else so the major issue is water quantity but if you look we are seeing land use intensification getting to the point where in the groundwater systems in lake systems and coastal lakes there are water quality issues managing water quantity and quality together will be crucial for the strategic water study
7440896 the water resource overall is plentiful but we have reached the limit to meeting demands without making better use of the resource
7440897 with storage we can meet all community needs we can make some gains with better management metering limits on volumes abstracted best practice etc and a lot is happening on this front now but the future is dependent on conserving water from alpine rivers
7440898 that request has been refused with some notable exceptions for example the waitaki river situation central government is resistant to any move away from devolution of water management
7440899 the problem with devolution is that water management decisions tend to be dominated by vocal vested interests particularly those who would derive a direct economic benefit from abstraction
7440900 the rma is being successfully used in other regions with significant pressures on water resources
7440901 freshwater management in canterbury could be improved in a number of ways for example effective water management plans could be put in place that set appropriate environmental flows above which allocation limits need to be effectively enforced
7440902 the main reason is that it deals with situations on a first come first served basis
7440903 it is a lawyers feast it takes too long to get decisions about investment it favours the wealthy including publicly owned state owned enterprises against the less resourced if an applicant has the wherewithal to take issues to highest court many players either withdraw or do not participate this has been a problem since day one
7440904 the solution is a realistic recognition of the limited ability of some regional councils to undertake good long term planning and that they need assistance and a clear exposition of the nations objectives in making best use of our natural resources
7440905 the effects based model is easier to apply to land rather than water water unlike land is a common pool resource with no private ownership multiple users can be recycled and therefore used in perpetuity
7440906 a better approach is for central government to give regional councils better tools for dealing with water issues and develop the capability of regional councils by setting national standards
7440907 the government could have provided a lead instead of letting each council invent the wheel for itself
7440908 if it was finished i could but id prefer not to now
7440909 its a very complicated story and it is complicated legislation although it has been long and expensive for us i dont think anyone could say it hadnt been fair
7440910 the first in first served approach of the rma around water allocation is ineffective and unfair its a gold rush mentality
7440911 the rma is not working well in managing diffuse pollution the good progress new zealand has made around reducing point source discharges has been more than displaced by increased pollution from diffuse pollution principally from the intensification of agriculture
7440912 the approach were taking of going to a collaborative engagement of stakeholders and broader public information has more value for us than just the rma style of managing adverse effects
7440913 dans le restaurant mon r les est de donner leau la bouche dans le mus e je me sers du go t pour parler de lart diff remment susciter des r actions faire parler des visiteurs entre eux a ouvre donc une porte pour rendre le mus e accessible au plus grand nombre
7440914 i believe in natural gas as a clean cheap alternative to fossil fuels
7440915 she knows it natural gas is a fossil fuel but includes it because compared to other fossil fuels coal and oil it burns more cleanly
7440916 civilizations flourish the most where the masses are passionate about their liberties
7440917 i had to stop saying why and understand that men that i adore so much dalai lama gandhi martin l king jr james baldwin and all the other heroes suffered some indignities in human relations far greater than i could ever imagine
7440918 these are the very guys i call my go to guys
7440919 so cowboy up take the hits grow from it learn from it and then understand it
7440920 i apologize to t r my colleagues the fans of the show and especially the lesbian and gay community for using a word that is unacceptable in any context or circumstance i can also no longer deny to myself that there are issues i obviously need to examine within my own soul and ive asked for help with one word ive hurt everyone who has struggled for the respect so many of us take for granted
7440921 im mad as hell and im not going to take it anymore
7440922 but the more i felt i tried to fight to hold on i got a lot of advice from congresspersons and politicians who said you know this is not going to end the way you think its going to end you need to leave theyre just using you to do xyz to which washington replied no ive got enough credit ive been a good boy but i realize it wasnt about that it was time for me to go it was time for me to go on so many levels and none of them had to do with what i wanted because i wanted to do something that wasnt gods plan
7440923 the plan was you did what you set out to do this is what one of my mentors sidney poitier told me
7440924 dr burke became a brand the representation of the medical community
7440925 whats at stake the top 10 issues affecting black america
7440926 weve gotten folks who can discuss these issues and whats happening from all sides of the coin
7440927 there will be balance from people who can speak with passion
7440928 im very passionate about providing security for the family if that means me trying to get my fathers material back im all for it
7440929 i cant rule out litigation i would hope that we can retrieve a good part of what he lost
7440930 he lost millions and it was morally and ethically wrong to take it from him he was devastated
7440931 i think hes inspirational and thats what this country needs right now
7440932 this is the first election where ive actually paid attention to every single thing and i think its because im a mom now
7440933 i just think barack is amazing i admire him i admire michelle
7440934 but this is cash money its a small boutique group of artists with a very similar fan base
7440935 theres a core group of consumers that associate with the specific cash money brand
7440936 when youre an independent you really do get full control you get to do it how you want to do it and promote it how i want to promote it and sell it how i want to sell it
7440937 its good to go out there and spread your wings and find new talent and work with people you havent worked with before id love to find the next pharrell or the next someone whos coming up and no one really knows yet
7440938 at the same time id love to work with the clutch and the j a m again
7440939 i just think it didnt get enough publicity so people would know its coming out
7440940 we didnt expect anything like what you have witnessed to occur
7440941 i am at a loss for words this is an insult to the olympic vision an insult to the spirit of tae kwon do and in my opinion an insult to mankind
7440942 thats when one deputy drew his weapon not knowing what the dudes were up to
7440943 were told at the time the weapon was drawn deputies did not know diddy was part of the group
7440944 been liaising with the immigration department on snoops application which has been approved

7440949 the only definitive account of the life and struggles of the woman at the center of the duke lacrosse case the alleged accuser
7440950 were it not for the duke lacrosse case she likely would be described as a bright young woman from durham north carolina who has had a difficult life
7440951 it would be great if i could holler at phelps
7440952 and its a compliment that the man found inspiration in the music i do for the streets over here over there in beijing
7440953 phelps and his american rival ryan lochte who is also a fan of jeezy greet each other by saying juh in homage to the rapper a k a jay jenkins
7440954 his goofy grin dissolves into a glower his eyes turn cold as ice the hip hop beats have a hypnotic effect on phelps who sometimes after a race is unable to recall the songs that locked him into his groove
7440955 over the years the active support of jerry butler dionne warwick and bonnie raitt has been enormously beneficial to the work of the rhythm amp blues foundation its only fitting that they serve as co hosts as we celebrate our accomplishments over the past twenty years and prepare to meet the challenges that will come in the next twenty years
7440956 brighter days are here cuz we declare that history wont repeat
7440957 is not scheduled to be in the recording studio with britney
7440958 the proper function of man is to live not to exist i shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them i shall use my time
7440959 your little broom the one you sweep off home plate with you butthole
7440960 dont worry little man im gonna fix this crazy shit
7440961 i have a lot of respect for crouch and defoe
7440962 they are good players and will score a lot of goals this year especially at home
7440963 crouch is tall and wins most things in the air and defoe is very quick around the box he is a sharp player who makes problems for defenders
7440964 una miniserie de cuatro noches de duraci n con una audiencia potencial de m s de 20 millones de personas
7440965 existen dos imperativos estrat gicos prioritarios en la convenci n
7440966 uno es hacer que la gente se ponga c moda con barack obama el otro es definir la carrera electoral con claridad estableciendo a obama como un factor de cambio y a mccain como continuaci n de las pol ticas de bush tanto a nivel nacional como en el extranjero
7440967 se trata de aclarar la idea de que las elecciones se realizar n entre dos candidatos y dos partidos pol ticos
7440968 no veo la alegr a que suele darse tras unas primarias
7440969 obama es un tipo que quiere unir al mundo pero que ha dividido al partido dem crata como nunca se hab a visto desde la guerra de vietnam
7440970 during peak times there were literally queues of customers waiting to see the tag heuer meridiist the corner where the tower display was situated was so full of people the corridor was completely blocked selfridges wonder room floor manager commented that he had never seen such enthusiasm and interest in a product in the wonder room on the first day of launch from staff and customers alike the selfridges sales team was overwhelmed with backorders from customers
7440971 if she has that kind of money saved why isnt she helping her mom
7440972 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7440973 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7440974 lisa i am very sorry to say youre single no more as i have spoken to your daddy therefore i would like to marry you
7440975 in three of those four were awaiting senate inquiry outcomes thats the sensible thing to do he said in canberra
7440976 the governments got its budget and it wants to get it through in the main senator brown said
7440977 if you take billions of dollars out of it then youve got to be able to say where you would elsewise get that money
7440978 i think its much better to have some constructive dialogue going on rather than telling people who are properly elected to this national pprliament by the people of australia to get out of the way senator brown said
7440979 the idea that the government is elected to do what it wants was found to be unpopular
7440980 maybe the prime minister hasnt yet got a good bead on where the greens are coming from senator brown said
7440981 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7440982 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7440983 what gets me is that hospitals will charge a person without insurance more for a service than a person with insurance that is wrong
7440984 kohapeal on ettev te kes kogub pr gi kokku ja ladustab kui laevaliiklus on taastunud siis viiakse pr gi mandrile

7440986 think of what you were when you were called not many were wise by human standards not many were influential not many were born of noble birth
7440987 i just fought friday night august 15 got back into town saturday evening and sunday my manager gave me a call saying i could be going to the ufc
7440988 after that i stayed up in bed for a few hours kind of in shock wondering if it was a dream or if it really did just happen
7440989 ive been on the cusp for a while now and it was just a matter of right place right time and being ready to go
7440990 im physically in shape and was ready to go at it with just a couple weeks notice
7440991 hes a good wrestler but not really slick on the ground
7440992 ive fought plenty of guys with heavy hands and knockout power hes strong but hes not a really technical striker but i definitely feel i match up well with him
7440993 i have heavy hands myself i have a good jab and plan to utilize that a lot if i keep the pressure on him and keep my hands in his face i think hell fold
7440994 it would be nice to pick opponents but ill fight whoever they decide to get me
7440995 im a new guy in the ufc so i dont get that luxury
7440996 getting on a six seven or eight fight winning streak and start going after titles thats the whole plan but for right now its just shut up and fight
7440997 id like to thank rumble sports management denaro sports keith maccallum team george gurgel my strength and conditioning coach eric ramsey and everybody at bcma training center in dayton ohio

7441005 im just glad itll be clark gable whos falling on his face and not gary cooper
7441006 now i am happy i did gone with the wind i wasnt when i was 28 but its part of black history
7441007 capable of bringing change that will benefit the people regardless of race
7441008 i think its a test of who protects the malay interests the most to which party will they entrust the political future
7441009 what is important to me is to win whether it is by a margin of one or 10 000 it doesnt matter
7441010 are the conventions scripted are they planned of course but this year theyre also exciting and historic
7441011 this is the first time since 1952 that we havent had an incumbent president or vice president on either side what we have is two candidates who bring an enormous amount of excitement to their candidacies so maybe were old fashioned but we are going to be there and on the air more than we were in 2004
7441012 they didnt suddenly get religion during the last four years what they got are ratings and profits
7441013 the networks made money off the primary campaigns in 2008 for the first time in many many elections and they want to try to continue to cash in
7441014 our job is to cover the news and there is without a question less and less news at the conventions
7441015 it is an enormous expenditure of money to cover these conventions the way we cover them and i would rather that we consider whether we should take the money that is shorter and shorter in all media and use it to cover the campaign
7441016 first i think we were all surprised by the amount of interest in the debates during the primary season which exceeded our estimates and i think were all going on the assumption that there is still a good deal of interest in politics this year
7441017 we suspected this would be an unbelievable political year but i dont think any us had any sense how intense the interest would be to the degree that several million people would come to watch our big events whether primary coverage or the debates
7441018 we know our core audience is a politically minded audience that wants this story and loves this story
7441019 we have all our resources and collective brainpower focused on this story it begins our signature time for the network to own this political story
7441020 the question i keep getting asked by people who are writing stories about convention coverage is why are you bothering whats the big deal arent they old fashioned havent they outlived their purpose
7441021 and i am always coming back saying this is the end of the most exciting campaign in my lifetime why wouldnt you want to be there for it
7441022 however with auto makers getting near the end of one model year and getting ready to start the next sales are beginning to show some signs of improving over julys dismal sales performance
7441023 for now the government is concentrating more on ensuring that he mwanawasa is given a decent burial and that since the body is going to go around the provinces weve got nine provinces and its only after that will it come back to lusaka for final burial i think that is the preoccupation now
7441024 as for the ruling party mmd of course within the dynamics of internal politics there is of course jostling for people who would want to participate in this election but so far things will only begin to crystallize after the burial
7441025 well the late president has said one of the criteria for a person qualified to be a candidate he must be free from graft and we will definitely uphold that because the people of zambia will not like to see a leadership that is corrupt to take charge of the affairs so that is one of the criteria and at the end of the day im sure we will succeed to uphold that one so all those who are cheating themselves that they will have it easy because he mwanawasa has passed on will be in for a rude shock
7441026 i think the development in the economy has been so salutary that there is nobody who can fault our party and the next election we are talking about is within 90 days and it would be very difficult for our opponents to galvanize resources and support within 90 days to be able to find a candidate who can beat our candidate so what he opposition leader michael sata obtained at that time i dont think the circumstances are still the same
7441027 if you recall that the last elections were sponsored by our own budget and i think we are still determined to go that way of course this is not saying that assistance which is without strings would not be accepted but i think we would like to go our own way so that at the end of the day the outcome is a zambian brewed outcome where the resources are zambian the participants are zambians and whoever is elected at that time will accept the will of the zambian people
7441028 as mmd we would like to ensure a clean campaign and respect the rule of law and that at any time we are mindful of the fact that the late president would have even accepted a loss in an election if the outcome was going to affirm to integrity so as far as we are concerned we will do a clean campaign so that the outcome has got integrity
7441029 while any catastrophe would be freightening it could also speed the spread of new models for sustainable planetary culture with a different relationship to nature and technology
7441030 i am sure the russians have left other surprises for us
7441031 they want to disrupt our life and our economy as much as possible
7441032 its been quiet where i was for the past two weeks but now i am worried even though i am happy to be back
7441033 i am afraid that what happened here with the russians will happen again
7441034 the situation in the black sea is tending to become more tense

7441042 a wall of ice coming towards us and we were carried 200 metres
7441043 i dont think well manage to recover the bodies because they finished up in an area of high risk in which there are highly unstable towers of ice that could easily collapse
7441044 last night it was cold it was nice so it was simply the weight of the ice which became too much
7441045 it was a big slab and that slab was big enough to reach the team of climbers
7441046 one of the worst accidents we have had for decades even when all precautions have been taken as seems to have been the case here things can go dramatically wrong
7441047 this isnt the first accident and it wont be the last

7441058 every day depended on whether she went to school then all day we worried did she stay at school all day did she come home this was just not something we could do anymore
7441059 these kids stay home from school one day and then the anxiety builds and builds
7441060 we had one girl who hadnt been to school in two years
7441061 picture it your child is crying and afraid to go to school its pretty darn hard to force them to go to school
7441062 all of a sudden the child stays home with the flu for three days and then doesnt want to go back to school again
7441063 once i had to talk a boy out of his house
7441064 i told him i want to hear you brushing your teeth
7441065 the longer a child suffers from school refusal behavior and is allowed to stay home the more difficult it is to return to school
7441066 its important to seek solutions and get them quickly back on the right track
7441067 its frustrating to admit that a stranger may know your kid better than you but dont wait another day
7441068 every new school we thought it would be different the teachers are different the kids are more mature but dont kid yourself
7441069 a lot of parents become frustrated and home school the kids but that should only be a last resort
7441070 i changed my whole way of thinking now everything isnt such a big deal
7441071 if i can help one kid who is going through what i went through that would be great
7441072 i did talk to him on the phone a short while ago and told him that he is in everyones thoughts and prayers
7441073 it was obviously the news that i did not want to hear
7441074 but after listening to the explanation and dr warrens thoughts on it i am convinced that this is the right procedure and the right way to go
7441075 the only thing i talked with michael about was his new challenge moving forward in his new assignment and he was very excited about that
7441076 obviously he loves the giants and obviously he is working for fox
7441077 right now he is relaxing and getting ready for his fox gig
7441078 i havent talked to any of the players or to kiwi or anyone this afternoon and until i do that i will just refrain from any thoughts about what might happen within our team
7441079 youre separating a family we dont know their financial stresses we have not walked a day in their shoes i dont doubt these parents love their children they just need help
7441080 they would have taken my kids if i wasnt honest with them
7441081 when he sees me he is excited when i leave he grabs his face and cries
7441082 im angry im frustrated i dont know how anyone lives as a single mom
7441083 without this program i was ready to throw my hands up
7441084 i wasnt just another dcf case to them i was a real person with real problems
7441085 you dont just turn if off when you go home
7441086 you worry about whether you did what you needed to do to make sure the child is safe and youve helped the family
7441087 not everybody can knock on peoples doors at 2 in the morning and talk to complete strangers
7441088 and when it comes to taking a kid who is crying for their parents its just not for everybody
7441089 thats the life of a pi man protective investigator you never know i never want to go into a home thinking shelter first you want to do everything you can you feel like you are giving the child another chance
7441090 when you take a child from a bad situation and put them in a good situation and watch them recover its the greatest thing in the world
7441091 i pledge allegiance to the earth and all the life which it supports one planet in our care irreplaceable with sustenance and respect for all
7441092 the military operation was started for achieving some basic objectives we wanted to ensure protection to lives and property of the people and dispel the impression from the minds of residents that the government had lost its writ in bajaur

7441108 le donne hanno imitato lautonomia maschile pensando che fosse la via maestra per la libert il prezzo che hanno pagato stato molto alto
7441109 viene prima la precondizione della compassione non posso partecipare alla gioia o al dolore di un altro se prima non ho stabilito un contatto con lui ci vuole prima questa capacit di sentirlo di mettersi al suo posto di immaginarsi nel luogo dellaltro poi semmai nasce la compassione ma non obbligatoriamente
7441110 non direi nellempatia ci sono momenti sia affettivi sia cognitivi al principio di tutto c lincontro tra i corpi il mio corpo entra in risonanza immediata con quello dellaltro ne leggo i segnali vedo il suo sguardo cupo o gioioso ed entro istantaneamente in contatto quasi un automatismo che le neuroscienze hanno spiegato con la recente scoperta dei neuroni specchio
7441111 poi per a partire da questa prima risonanza la cosa si complica per sentire laltro mi devo spostare nel luogo in cui lui sta un luogo che non conosco e che mi pu essere estraneo qui si mette al lavoro limmaginazione che unattivit della mente il che per non significa che sia unattivit astratta e freddamente razionale anche limmaginazione intrisa di emozione di passione e di desiderio
7441112 se empatia provare ad andare dove laltro sta allora devi fare continuamente i conti con lestraneit di questo luogo non puoi mai smettere di renderti conto del fatto che laltro ha una pelle e uno sguardo diversi dai tuoi
7441113 perch siamo perennemente in relazione ed bene averlo presente anche quando stiamo scrivendo una legge o svolgendo una ricerca o progettando qualcosa siamo in relazione con qualcuno queste mirabili attivit di oggettivazione dello spirito sono intrecciate e segnate dalle relazioni che le hanno nutrite gran parte delle nostre azioni sono relazionali anche quando crediamo di andare autonomamente per la nostra strada e meglio esserne consapevoli nellamore per esempio tendiamo a vedere tutto bianco o nero stiamo insieme o no viviamo insieme o ci lasciamo funziona o il fallimento vinciamo o perdiamo e invece tra questi estremi che capita tutto il territorio della relazione questo sta in questo mezzo che a noi appare vuoto
7441114 il tema dellempatia oggi studiato anche dal punto di vista neurobiologico
7441115 des maharashtra is the first government department to implement such a system with this new computerized system information collected at various regional and district statistical offices can be consolidated at the state head office without any delay and the complex analysis can be carried out more easily and with greater accuracy we are pleased that the solution was commissioned on time by blue star infotech
7441116 we are delighted to have executed this prestigious project for the government of maharashtra and we certainly hope to replicate this success in other similar e governance initiatives we are extremely grateful to the des staff members whose commitment and close involvement enabled us to implement this complex system on time
7441117 mobile advertising in india can be bigger than internet advertising in the next three four years
7441118 as such everyone benefits the key lies in publishers creating media on mobile based on sms and permission from the subscribers
7441119 but it is just starting mobile ad spend is currently estimated to be just about rs 250 300 million
7441120 we term it invertising invited advertising we think the blue ocean lies in enabling brands and businesses to build relationships with consumers on the mobile
7441121 to make it even more catchy consumers can be given incentives such as free talk time if they opt for ads
7441122 operator portal and sms advertising are just starting to happen mytoday has seen over 100 brands use the platform with over 30 percent of them repeating campaigns
7441123 the overall advertising opportunity is either text based such as sms or voice based such as branded caller tune or ring back tunes with ads
7441124 agencies and media planners are still taking time to understand the potential

7441127 cheap laptops are also now accessible some can be bought for less than qr2 000 that is why many people opt for a laptop
7441128 i bought laptop because i need it in school it is a big help in making presentations research computing grades and others my laptop also enables me to communicate with my loved ones
7441129 laptops nowadays have become a necessity not a luxury its a must for many professionals like engineers who derive templates and other things related to their job from the web

7441139 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
7441140 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move

7441145 today is the anniversary of the landfall of hurricane andrew in 1992
7441146 we still have a little more hurricane season to go
7441147 we need something like this to recharge the soil it probably wont be a total drought buster

7441152 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
7441153 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
7441154 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen
7441155 this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places
7441156 to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
7441157 saakashvili should be tried for the stupidity that he has committed here
7441158 but any trial should only happen after the barbarians have left our country
7441159 id rather be in my home than in a destroyed building
7441160 but im sure the country will be reunited again im 100 percent sure
7441161 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
7441162 it will be a difficult autumn and it will be a difficult winter
7441163 it is unlikely to be promoted as a fight to open a small warong stalls to sell noodles or taking a quick shower in a cool morning
7441164 they can see its not a huge problem some have even gone out on activities on tours or sand biking
7441165 the water is very deep its already at everybodys door
7441166 the u s is a signer of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty meaning that we have agreed to give up all of our nuclear weapons and that certainly has not occurred
7441167 the government continues to do r amp d on new nuclear weapons systems voters in marin in their wisdom felt that if the county government chose not to contract with those companies and they saw they were losing business with local governmental entities they might not pursue those sorts of contracts in the future
7441168 most of the time the big companies on our list arent too worried about us
7441169 but occasionally we do get a response from a smaller company
7441170 if someone wants to do training at uc berkeley or the university of california system we get a request because their regents manage the lawrence livermore and los alamos labs
7441171 in general the county departments are very thorough in enforcing the nuclear free zone law
7441172 we sent an affidavit to verizon that asks if indeed they are the contractor for the weapons related system we have identified
7441173 if they do not respond in the negative then marin county has no alternative but to find a contractor other than verizon
7441174 the intent of the law was to discourage our government from continuing to use nuclear weapons in its foreign policy goals
7441175 thats why marin county voters felt it was important enough to pass and for the most part its been very successful
7441176 the figure that the attractiveness of rara has shown fully now arrived
7441177 her active posing is like jumping in one second having a stick on her arm we made the figure with the image of rara in the story her right arm is changeable so you can enjoy her not having a stick as well
7441178 i feel like already a definitive edition of rara figure has arrived costume pose face expression everything shows raras character its worthy of our reputation her beautiful shining dress her hair color graduation etc its well done
7441179 her active and dynamic posing that looks like she is gonna jump in a second and her energetic smile she looks smart in her costume that fits on her body
7441180 this is powerful medicine and it must be respected you take only a teaspoonful and then say 1 2 3 when you do that you will be longer and harder than you have ever been in your life and you can perform as long as you want
7441181 your partner must say 1 2 3 4 the shaman responded

7441185 they fired rockets and entered the house after breaking the main gate they killed our five or six guards and then my elder brother and two nephews
7441186 saakashvili should be tried for the stupidity that he has committed here

7441189 but im sure the country will be reunited again im 100 percent sure
7441190 the last thing im worried about is about my political future right now
7441191 it will be a difficult autumn and it will be a difficult winter
7441192 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7441193 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7441194 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win

7441198 well good luck like i say thats in the past
7441199 right now were looking forward to playing the deshis bangladesh up in darwin
7441200 well get our chance in the next 15 months to play against the poms back in england
7441201 its a great result for all the players just to find out whether were going or not going

7441223 what were all hoping now is the situation in pakistan allows us to go there next year
7441224 if the expert advice says its safe we go and were happy to recommend to players that we go
7441225 if the safety and security advice says its not safe then we dont go and our track record speaks for itself on that front
7441226 professional risk assessment says the risk is acceptable in some of those places unfortunately at the moment its not acceptable in pakistan
7441227 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7441228 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7441229 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognize the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted
7441230 its a sizable agreement and were going to take a close hard look at it
7441231 the coalition forces invaded afghanistan and we know that women are very important to the forces that invaded afghanistan our women and common people are important to us too
7441232 afghanistan has to try to have good relations with you but if your government continues a reversed policy the afghans will be obliged to kill your nationals in revenge for their brothers their sisters and their children events such as logar will happen again because occupied afghanistan looks at all actors that are established in the interest of america with an eye of hostility
7441233 we take any threat seriously but lets be frank this is a very insidious and deceptive piece of propaganda as a terrorist organization they target innocent aid workers their own civilians and they are involved in some of the worst forms of violence that weve seen were not going to be intimidated quite frankly
7441234 i dont begrudge a single cent of the money spent preparing our athletes for the olympics
7441235 i think most kiwis would feel very proud of the achievements of the team
7441236 well need to see the detailed debrief and look at how much needs to go into the next effort
7441237 the reality is you cant compete at this very top level of international sport like the olympics as a gifted amateur you have to have the whole envelope of support around you and that costs
7441238 we can never be totally happy the world is moving on in terms of performance and if we stay still we will get further behind so what that means is that in our review which will take place when we get back we have to look for another edge
7441239 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7441240 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7441241 the sky is blue the air is clear the olympics created this image for us but can we sustain it i dont know
7441242 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7441243 but they are a seed of change compared with the situation before
7441244 the world today is in need of mutual understanding inclusiveness cooperation and harmonious development
7441245 the beijing olympic games is a testimony of the fact that the world has its trust rested upon china
7441246 i really hope people remember the friendliness of the chinese our happy attitudes and our welcoming ways
7441247 it will be hard to pick a favorite memory from these games
7441248 i dont know anyone that wouldnt pay three to five dollars because theyd be paying it in their 40 minutes of the car running
7441249 yes think of what 40 minutes sitting congested lock stock and block stopped with your vehicle running it actually costs you more than that
7441250 i have confidence in him but hed be best advised to be less excited in future
7441251 mr williamson got a bit excited and hes quite wrong to suggest that anyone would be paying 50 a week that figure is simply unacceptable and it wont be happening

7441278 i ask students do you want to have a nationally ranked football team where you have to put in some effort for seats or do you want seats to every game even though those games arent as exciting some sacrifices have to be made and we tried to be as fair as possible
7441279 in the past we replaced them when students had to cut them off for work or internships
7441280 now its up to them to decide when to put the wristband on
7441281 that doesnt mean that a student with very few points has no chance at getting a ticket
7441282 the beauty of the lottery system is that at some point its out of everybodys hands its up to chance
7441283 what we do is just try to install our offense and try to really work hard on his technique
7441284 ive been impressed with casey on how much his technique has improved and how coachable he is i think thats the greatest thing about him he tries to listen to exactly what you say and then tries to do it the next time
7441285 that gives him a chance to keep getting better and really have a good year for us
7441286 i think he did a great job of working hard all spring to improve
7441287 hes worked really hard at learning the offense and learning the system
7441288 we had heard a lot about casey dick but since weve been here he has really worked
7441289 his eyes are open hes listening and hes interested in being a fantastic player
7441290 casey has really been doing a good job of being open to learning
7441291 he knows that we have high expectations for him hes starting to have those same expectations for himself
7441292 i think you have to put guys in position to give them confidence during practice so they see themselves having success
7441293 then they walk around with a little more bounce in their step and feel better about themselves everything is about confidence if you feel confident youre going to play better
7441294 i think its important for dick to have success weve always built our offense around the quarterback being successful and having confidence we try to do things early in the game or early in a series so they get into the flow and feel good about themselves thats how we all are if you feel good about yourself and are confident youre going to play better coach better be a better husband or whatever it is
7441295 his fundamentals and techniques have to be right but then he has to execute all that in a split second once the game starts
7441296 its a challenge but i expect him to have a big season
7441297 we have decided to pilot a concept that is popular in the united kingdom and europe where donors combine a holiday with fundraising you are invited to join us in our first ever charity adventure hike it will take place from 2nd to 8th october at marrick safari in the northern cape situated on 3000 hectares of pristine savannah by raising r10 000 you will cover the full cost of your participation as well as make a generous contribution to soil for lifes work

7441301 first the doctor needs to have a detailed history of the incident as alleged by the victim then he must conduct a full medical examination complete a thorough examination on the private parts of the patient and do some investigation
7441302 the doctor has to send bodily specimens of the victim to the forensic unit all these must be completed you cant do a preliminary examination and conclude that the patient was sexually abused or otherwise
7441303 please do not be swayed by the so called medical report because it is not conclusive in the first place we do not know if the medical report printed in the flyer is aunthentic or otherwise the medical reports aunthenticity must be confirmed
7441304 from a professional point of view i have to say that it is not conclusive you cant take a preliminary medical report and say it is conclusive
7441305 we also want to talk to the doctor but he seems to be uncontactable
7441306 i advise the public not to jump to conclusion or assumption on this matter based on the flyer to make a conclusive medical report one must have the experience and expertise in handling such cases whether the report is true or otherwise just let the court decide
7441307 our investigation team had visited the hospital and we are waiting for their investigation report
7441308 where is her office and would she want to have some lunch tomorrow

7441316 on the other hand we have to do a responsible investigation to respect the rights of the children which is why they stay put while we are investigating
7441317 this is not a cursory investigation were talking about people who might be sitting outside a house at 5 in the morning theyre very skilled investigators
7441318 kids will learn about their teammates living outside of the county and they will turn them in before the season starts they take it seriously
7441319 the school system has been working with the county to try to reinforce that we are diligent about our residency
7441320 by having the new residency verification process we can really help schools manage this issue

7441326 jean baptiste oudry was one of the finest painters of animals in 18th century europe and he employed his prodigious talents to produce life size paintings of star specimens from the menagerie of french king louis xv never intended as an encyclopedic zoo the versailles menagerie was compiled through royal commission and diplomatic gifts exotic animals were imported on merchant ships along with sugar coffee and indigo and were intimately connected with colonialism and the luxury trade oudry painted these animals as individuals he used portrait conventions such as theatrical poses dramatic light effects imaginary landscape backdrops and sensual color to give his paintings great drama
7441327 the entrance to hagenbecks zoo in hamburg c1910 hagenbeck was a flamboyant character who supplied zoos and circuses with wild animals and native people his zoo was the first to remove cages and build fake scenery and mountains so the animals could be seen in their natural habitat the entrance expresses the victorian confidence in their command of the natural world perfectly

7441337 the pharisees held that only israelites are men gentiles classed not as men but as barbarians
7441338 he withdrew his shining legal protection from them and transferred their property rights to israel
7441339 it follows that the gentiles were excepted from the general civil laws of moses
7441340 the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as one born among you and thou shalt love him as thyself for ye were strangers in the land of egypt ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment in meteyard in weight or in measure
7441341 one law and one manner shall be for you and for the stranger that sojourneth with you
7441342 the pharisees sit in moses seat and by their tradition make the commandments of god of none effect
7441343 the pharisees held that only israelites are men gentiles they classed not as men but as barbarians
7441344 quoting the prophet ye my flock the flock of my pasture are men
7441345 and i will judge between cattle and cattle and i will set up one shepherd over them even my servant david
7441346 and ye my flock are men and i am your god saith the lord god
7441347 who allowed the wine to be used on the ground that the majority of thieves in that city are jews
7441348 may be cast in and need not be brought up
7441349 one is obliged to bring them up on account of ill feeling
7441350 he could offer such excuses as i have to run to my boy who is standing on the roof or i have to keep my appointment at the court
7441351 the interpretation is based on the use of the singular i will require
7441352 it is written unto the people upon it and elsewhere it is written abide ye here with the ass which may be rendered people that are like an ass slaves who are considered the property of the master
7441353 he that spread forth the earth he that giveth breath unto the people upon it
7441354 and abraham said unto his young men abide ye here with the ass and i and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again unto you
7441355 now according to eliezer who based his view on ezekiel 26 20
7441356 i shall bring thee down with them that descend into the pit in the lower parts of the earth
7441357 if the road leads solely to that place it is forbidden but if one can go by it to any other place it is permitted
7441358 the sages should not mind the possibility of receiving money of an idolator
7441359 the torah talmud outlawed the issue of a gentile as that of a beast
7441360 in truth ashi coincided with the opinion of the authority stated above namely that gentile property is considered public property like unclaimed land in the desert
7441361 rab judah said in the name of samuel the property of a heathen is on the same footing as desert land whoever first occupies it acquires ownership
7441362 a gentile observing the sabbath deserves death not even on mondays is the gentile allowed to rest probably to discourage general idleness
7441363 a heathen who keeps a day of rest deserves death their prohibition is their death sentence
7441364 for it is written and a day and a night they shall not rest genesis 8 22
7441365 while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease
7441366 thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates
7441367 here the gentile is excepted as he is not a neighbor
7441368 the mishnah declares that if a gentile sued an israelite the verdict is for the defendant the jew if the israelite is the plaintiff he obtains full damages
7441369 where a suit arises between an israelite and a heathen if you can justify the former according to the laws of israel justify him and say this is our law so also if you can page 19 justify him by the laws of the heathens justify him and say to the other party this is your law but if this cannot be done we use subterfuges to circumvent him
7441370 now according to rabbi akiba the whole reason appears to be because of the sanctification of the name but were there no infringement of the sanctification of the name we could circumvent him
7441371 the throes of mother zion which is in labor to bring forth the messiah without metaphor the jewish people
7441372 the jews are destined to eat their fill in the days of messiah
7441373 when the ox runs and falls the horse is put into his stall
7441374 it will be difficult to remove the gentiles from their position without inflicting much suffering
7441375 the years of plenty which the messiah will usher in will be enjoyed by the israelites
7441376 a min christian said to rabbi abbahu when will the messiah come he replied when darkness covers those people alluding to the questioner and his companions you curse me he exclaimed
7441377 the cock said to the bat i look forward to the light because i have sight but of what use is the light to thee
7441378 thus israel should hope for the redemption because it will be a day of light to them but why should the gentiles seeing that for them it will be a day of darkness
7441379 defilement by seminal emission so that an israelite child should not become accustomed to commit pederasty i e sodomy with him
7441380 and ye shall not swear by name falsely neither lie one to another i am the lord
7441381 all vows obligations oaths whether called konam konas or by any other name which we may vow or swear or pledge or whereby we may be bound from this day of atonement until the next whose happy coming we await we do repent may they be deemed absolved forgiven annulled and void and made of no effect the vows shall not be reckoned vows the obligations shall not be obligatory nor the oaths be oaths
7441382 and it shall be forgiven all the congregation of israel page 20 and the stranger that sojourneth among them seeing all the people were in ignorance
7441383 every vow which i may make in the future shall be null his vows are then invalid providing that he remembers this at the time of the vow
7441384 this may have provided support for the custom of reciting kol nidre a formula for dispensation of vows prior to the evening service of the day of atonement but kol nidre as part of the ritual is later than the talmud as the law of revocation in advance was not made public
7441385 with respect to robbery if one stole or robbed footnote
7441386 for murder whether of a cuthean by a cuthean or of an israelite by a cuthean punishment is incurred but of a cuthean by an israelite there is no death penalty
7441387 withholding of a laborers wage one cuthean from another or a cuthean from an israelite is forbidden but an israelite from a cuthean is permitted
7441388 this only borders on a robbery for actual robbery means depriving a person of what he already possesses
7441389 if a heathen smites a jew he is worthy of death
7441390 rabbi hanina also said he who smites an israelite on the jaw is as though he had thus assaulted the divine presence
7441391 it is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy
7441392 one who smiteth man that is an israelite attacketh the holy one
7441393 a heathen who studies the torah deserves death it is our inheritance not theirs he is as guilty as one who violates a bethrothed maiden
7441394 this seems a very strong expression it is suggested that rabbi johanan feared the knowledge of gentiles in matters of jurisprudence as they would use it against the jews in their opponents courts the talmud places r page 21 johanans dictum immediately after the passage dealing with the setting up of law courts by gentiles
7441395 gods covenant with israel was only for the sake of the oral law ie talmud
7441396 intended killing a heathen and he killed an israelite he is not liable
7441397 threw a stone into a company of israelites and heathens shall we say the company consisted of nine heathens and one israelite his non liability can be inferred from the fact that the majority were heathens even if half and half since we do not know whether he aimed at an israelite or a heathen he is not liable
7441398 verse under discussion teaches that the murderer is not liable

7441404 it seemed so very far away but he talked about it with great conviction and impressed upon us the need to believe and then do the work to achieve it

7441414 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7441415 these players have given of themselves for three years theyve given up their summers theyve bought into the whole team thing they set their personal egos aside theyve done everything asked of them

7441443 the reception is an opportunity for sen clinton to see her delegates many for the first time since the primaries ended thank them for their hard work and support and most importantly to encourage them to support and work for sen obama as strongly as she has in order to elect him in november
7441444 in recognition of the historic race she ran and the fact that she was the first woman to compete in all of our nations primary contests
7441445 this campaign is not about barack obama and hillary clinton
7441446 his campaign is about george bush and four more years of george bush under john mccain
7441447 that message is going to echo clearly from this platform
7441448 sort of like us he obama comes from a middle class background he went to school on scholarships he had to pay off student loans he and his wife had to worry about child care
7441449 the republican track record on national security has not been particularly good
7441450 my job in this campaign is to explain that talking tough and acting dumb is not a way to keep you safe and secure

7441458 throughout the years dockwise has been engaged in projects for different international navies with a large variety of naval equipment involved mobilizing or demobilizing military naval equipment on its own power is for different reasons not always possible the capacity of the dockwise vessels often allows for creative and unorthodox solutions apart from other arguments such as safety security reduction of wear and tear and predetermined arrival targets the contribution of these contracts once again indicates the importance of the market diversity on which the dockwise strategy is built

7441531 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7441532 without doubt its not a comfortable situation either for him or for us
7441533 he continues with the team because we are going to see what happens we need to think that he could also remain with the team this season
7441534 his declarations have been inopportune but nobody is going to be kept at the club against their will

7441553 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7441554 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7441555 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7441556 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre

7441558 manifestamos nuestro repudio contra el estado chileno y sus aparatos policiales quienes ingresan a nuestras comunidades para allanarlas con violencia desmedida golpeando y disparando a nuestros ni os mujeres y ancianos destruyendo nuestras casas con la nica justificaci n de encontrar armamento y culparnos de actos de terroristas
7441559 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos

7441561 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7441562 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas

7441564 encuentro por la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural traw n itrofillke che ka zugu g tramgealu
7441565 una invitaci n y un desaf o a imaginar dialogar y debatir sobre interculturalidad en chile desde perspectivas que ayuden a comprender y mejorar las pr cticas actuales
7441566 constituir una plataforma de di logo in dita en una regi n donde existe un conflicto inter tnico no resuelto y la diversidad sigue estando asociada al miedo a la fragmentaci n social
7441567 la idea es generar un espacio de encuentro debate y dialogo entre distintos actores del mbito acad mico empresarial estado y sociedad civil relativo a diversos aspectos de la convivencia intercultural en el contexto local nacional y latinoamericano
7441568 trabajo colectivo entre los actores interesados en imaginar un nuevo proyecto de sociedad considerando los actuales debates pol tico jur dicos sobre la materia
7441569 la diversidad cultural es hoy en d a una prioridad pero se requieren pol ticas que no s lo apunten al plano simb lico sino que tambi n al plano de los derechos
7441570 aspectos jur dico pol ticos de la diversidad y la convivencia intercultural
7441571 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7441572 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7441573 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta
7441574 incurren en un injustificado rigor formal que atenta contra la garant a constitucional de la defensa en juicio
7441575 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7441576 si es necesario ir iremos nuevamente si es por m s carabineros m s carabineros mandaremos
7441577 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7441578 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7441579 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7441580 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7441581 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7441582 protocolo espec fico adicional sobre recursos h dricos compartidos entre la rep blica de chile y la rep blica argentina
7441583 ning n proyecto de inversi n podr pretender hacerse rentable a costa del medio ambiente incorporaremos el ordenamiento territorial y el manejo integrado de cuencas como eje de nuestra nueva pol tica
7441584 una grave falta tica si estos productos son reorientados a otros mercados donde no hay controles respecto a estas extremadamente peligrosas sustancias t xicas
7441585 producci n y uso de sustancias qu micas y bienes de consumo
7441586 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7441587 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7441588 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7441589 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7441590 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7441591 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros
7441592 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7441593 y d nde est el famoso estado de derecho sirve acaso para algo
7441594 estamos ante un hecho delictual o m s bien pol tico
7441595 claramente se trata de un simple hecho delictual lo peor ser a darle un cariz pol tico a estas acciones vand licas repudiadas por la ciudadania
7441596 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7441597 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7441598 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7441599 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad
7441600 62 hect reas una yunta de bueyes una vaca parida semillas y madera
7441601 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7441602 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7441603 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7441604 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7441605 lo que parec a ser una gran noticia resulta en una garant a sin contenido una ges para unas pocas mujeres que por distintas circunstancias pueden hacer uso de este derecho
7441606 una rep blica que se apresta a celebrar 200 a os de existencia y una econom a que busca incansablemente su asociaci n con la elite mundial no parece condecirse con las pr cticas de represi n y hostigamiento a las movilizaciones sociales y la brutalidad policial como las que se registran en este informe
7441607 la preocupante situaci n de las corporaciones de asistencia judicial las que constituyen el principal soporte del sistema de asistencia jur dica gratuita del pa s toda vez que cuentan con un presupuesto insuficiente y una estructura organizacional atomizada y asentada en la figura de los egresados de derecho que realizan su pr ctica profesional
7441608 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7441609 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo
7441610 existe todo un procedimiento en caso que las fuerzas armadas tengan que participar en apoyo de la polic a nacional para el control del orden p blico as como la protecci n de un servicio p blico esencial se explic al personal militar cuales son las alternativas que tienen los revoltosos dentro del rechazo de parte del ej rcito puede ser mediante una acci n letal de disparar a la pierna los brazos hasta una acci n letal esperemos que la cordura se manifieste y no tengamos que ir a all estamos listos tenemos los medios tenemos el helic ptero tenemos todo
7441611 pedimos al ejecutivo que tenga mucho cuidado esta no es una movilizaci n normal y corriente el gobierno ha declarado una guerra abierta a los ind genas y ellos han dicho que continuar con su protesta hasta que no se solucionen sus problemas no tienen miedo prefieren morir all que perder sus tierras
7441612 hay un movimiento para liberar los territorios ancestrales ind genas y hasta ser independientes del estado peruano
7441613 desmiento cualquier vinculaci n con patria roja no hemos recibido ninguna llamada del congresista isla no tenemos nada que ver con hugo ch vez no tenemos nada que ver con ning n partido pol tico porque stos lejos de solucionarnos los problemas nos traen m s

7441615 existe una soluci n en el fondo del problema que un ente arbitral como el tc puede resolver sobre la nulidad o no de estas normas lo que ah tenemos es una luz sin que esto impida que se extiendan con mayor profundidad los mecanismos de concertaci n y di logo

7441617 the thought that online broadcasting could replace broadcasters over the air business is a pipe dream

7441640 all i need him to do next year is hit hes not going to play the outfield i think hes got a chance to be fine its a matter of centering more balls and i think he can do that
7441641 sheff can still be a force offensively he can still put fear in pitchers
7441642 ive played with a lot of guys who are as fast as gathright but ive never seen someone who can change direction like that guy can he may as well be barry sanders
7441643 im happy as hell for him hes a really good guy and he works really hard and hes one of my good friends
7441644 i think you saw the classic nfl approach for a young quarterback
7441645 pressure him to see if he can handle it and if he cant handle it keep pressuring him
7441646 its the tampa philosophy where they have excellent team speed and that showed up tonight
7441647 shauns an outstanding football player theres no doubt about it
7441648 his ability his size and his athleticism for a guy that big is special we lost a big part of our middle the interior of our defense when we lost him
7441649 but we replaced him with some guys that we think are pretty darn good football players in their own way chuck darby being one shaun codys healthy langston moore those are guys that have to step up and make the plays that people in detroit got accustomed to shaun making
7441650 it gives the quarterback a little something to think about before we can get back there
7441651 university education seems to benefit only the rich for instance the number of students who join the university of nairobi because they can pay are more than those who get admitted because of their good grades
7441652 ideally a lecturer should supervise two masters students and one doctorate student but currently we have numerous cases where a lecturer is supervising 45 masters students and five doctorate students while at the same time teaching undergraduates
7441653 we cannot talk about quality assurance when universities are ill equipped lecturers are overworked libraries have no books and journals and research is not being carried out
7441654 without the parallel programmes operations in public universities would have ground to a halt a long time ago fees charged for the various programmes now contribute more than 60 per cent of the budgets of all public universities
7441655 the number of students left out is unacceptably high for kenyas economic development and social well being these students have every right to pursue higher education and if they can pay for it i see no problem
7441656 parallel degree programmes expand access to higher education and rein in capital flight
7441657 this programme is the best thing that ever happened to the education sector in this country

7441665 those whom god effectually calleth he also freely justifieth not by infusing righteousness into them but by pardoning their sins and by accounting and accepting their persons as righteous not for any thing wrought in them or done by them but for christs sake alone by gods imputing the obedience and satisfaction of christ unto them they receiving and resting on him and his righteousness by faith which faith they have not of themselves it is the gift of god

7441677 posthumous baptisms by proxy have been common practice for the mormons for more than a century allowing the dead to be baptised into the faith so they may be united in the after life
7441678 it is worth noting that all bar three catholic dioceses had lifted any restrictions on access to the national librarys holding of microfilmed parish registered records some years ago
7441679 you should be aware that microfilms of the roman catholic parish registers are already available in many local heritage centres through the country
7441680 the archdiocese has not surrendered its claim to copyright of the records held in trust at the national library in due course a full statement on the matter will be made
7441681 we really needed to get away from california and the drug life and all of that
7441682 we had our problems theres no question about it so coming to ireland was like beginning all over again and it afforded us that time to get back to basics really we bought a house down in cork and we gardened and i learnt to cook really cook for the first time and used all the produce from the garden and so on we started a whole new life
7441683 my grandmother who came from belfast used to come to cork every winter because it was warmer down here
7441684 one of the reasons i thought of cork was that if were going to live in ireland we want to try and live in a climate that is a little less difficult and sharp and cold such as the north or dublin which is a good deal colder than cork
7441685 my husband was british he came from london and it was very easy for him to fall into the irish way
7441686 we loved living here and we never were able to give it up
7441687 we sold that house but we had to come back which we did 10 years later we bought a piece of land and built a new house we did that in 1992 and ive had that ever since
7441688 i cant put my nose out the door that people dont recognise jessica fletcher so i have no real private life at all
7441689 the only place im really at ease is los angeles where people dont watch murder she wrote

7441691 he never got a fair trial and in due course that will be expanded upon
7441692 glitters case raises the issue of whether we as citizens have a legal entitlement to a passport that taking it away is really under the royal prerogative
7441693 i heard he was out but i havent heard from him and i dont expect to when he lived with me he was a lovely man but i have moved on
7441694 here we have someone in the public eye and in terms of a new identity you cant really give him one i would have thought that the police will conclude that the measures they have to put in place will be minimal
7441695 i felt the plane judder violently to the left and then right before it went down
7441696 then i felt a sharp blow in my chest that sent me flying several metres i ended up in a ditch with water in it which must have protected me from the flames
7441697 flight attendants usually sit at the rear of the plane but i was right at the front in seat 1e that part of the plane was hardly burnt it was a miracle
7441698 all around me i could hear people crying out for help they were shouting and calling desperately but i couldnt move i couldnt do anything a few minutes later i heard the sirens of the rescue teams i knew they were going to save me
7441699 we feared the worst there were more and more dead how could she have survived
7441700 they lied to me my daughters dead and they lied
7441701 its a miracle when i heard she was alive i expected shed be covered in burns and would have lost her hair but no its all there
7441702 this paper argues that recent and future changes in the employment of crown servant engineers will soon leave the mod unable to fulfil its intelligent customer remit and hence jeopardize airworthiness

7441717 our findings support the idea that bondage and discipline and sadomasochism bdsm is simply a sexual interest or subculture attractive to a minority
7441718 however they were no more likely to have been coerced into sexual activity and were not significantly more likely to be unhappy or anxious
7441719 people with these sexual interests have long been seen by medicine and the law as at best damaged and in need of therapy and at worst dangerous and in need of legal regulation
7441720 and need particularly strong stimuli such as being beaten or tied up to become aroused

7441745 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7441746 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7441747 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7441748 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees

7441760 the downward trend now is firmly in place and we will go through those supports
7441761 with an rba rate cut cycle imminent that should continue to weigh on the australian dollar as well as the stronger us dollar and weaker commodity price trends
7441762 were not expecting the us dollar to continue to appreciate at the pace weve seen in the past month but were looking for it to strengthen over the medium term
7441763 the key driver for that is we are going to get in the early part of the week is some negative us housing data
7441764 we saw a pretty strong sell off on friday night
7441765 some of those gains will be unwound tonight and the aussie market is pre empting moves in the us
7441766 we have housing data as a reminder of the credit crisis of just where it all began

7441770 this forecast has been buoyed by the anticipated synergies from the mackay permanent acquisition but at the same time has been tempered with caution in lending operations and wholesale funding costs managing director ron hancock said
7441771 we will monitor the market over coming months for the opportunity to further recoup these additional costs on wholesale funding mr hancock said in a statement

7441775 the government has allocated rs 306 82 billion for establishing 16 central universities 370 colleges eight indian institutes of technology iits seven indian institutes of management 10 national institutes of technology 20 indian institutes of information technology five indian institutes of science education and research and 50 centres for training and research in frontier areas
7441776 however according to estimates by the planning commission this fund is not enough and the required resource gap will remain rs 2 22 trillion
7441777 as per the planning commission the country needs an additional 200 universities it is thus clear that public resources would not be sufficient to meet the ever growing demand for quality in higher education and increasing private sector investment and participation will be required to meet such demands

7441784 we are glad to be able to revise some of our fares with the recent lowering of fuel prices
7441785 although fuel prices have fallen gradually in recent weeks it is still some 60 percent above the average price per barrel in 2007
7441786 the government will be left with no option but to return the 400 acres to the unwilling farmers we will continue to agitate till our demand is met
7441787 giving away 400 acres means giving up the entire project which is not possible we want another round of discussion with the opposition party during which some solution can come up
7441788 forceful acquisition of land is unconstitutional we will fight against this and win
7441789 we will do peaceful agitation till our demand is met
7441790 the west bengal government is planning to arrange alternate land for the unwilling farmers whose 400 acre was acquired for setting up ancillary industries for the tata motors factory at singur but first we have to find out actually how many unwilling farmers are there
7441791 trinamool can do whatever they want to but the singur issue can only be solved through discussions both the parties need to iron out differences first and then only can we come to a solution
7441792 there is a 500 acre low lying infertile plot opposite to the tata motors factory site which is owned by the cpi m promoters
7441793 talking about peace in this vital area of the world requires intensified efforts to remove all causes of tension therefore establishing an effective balance of power in the region will be achieved only if all middle east countries undertake to ban the use of nuclear and other mass destruction weapons
7441794 these applications have been cleared by the state industries ministry but achuthanandan says these need to be discussed with the party leadership and also in the ldf if that was the case why did he initially agree to clear these applications
7441795 achuthanandan is playing to the gallery by opposing these applications just to come clean in his party where he is losing support because the majority faction is hounding him
7441796 wees een beetje lief voor haar en wees positief over haar werk
7441797 the gesture was shown by the chief minister shivraj singh chouhan at a function at gwalior on saturday
7441798 my government would be more than happy if tata motors decides to set up its plant for nano project at gwalior in madhya pradesh the government would be willing to offer land and other facilities required for setting up the project
7441799 cand vei fi adela pe care am cunoscut o sa ma cauti pana atunci ciao
7441800 and i told the tv cameraman exactly where i was going to go
7441801 in my perspective its a great and special week for us
7441802 imagine we have truck drivers driving 2 200 miles from charlotte back to here its like all the hard work it paid off unexpected hard work
7441803 im not upset with anything particularly we just did absolutely nothing right
7441804 i dont know why we stayed out there when the car in the front of us is three seconds slower and we couldnt make up track position
7441805 it really was killing him coming in second all the time
7441806 obviously in the beginning its like i want to win the race as well but its great to see him get the win and now that hes got his win he can relax a little
7441807 it wasnt as easy today as i wanted it to be when the yellow came out because its a catch 22 no matter what you did
7441808 and helio had to work a lot harder than maybe what he should have had to work
7441809 it worked out in the end we were able to put just the right amount of fuel in each time we stopped to be able to get the track position we needed so that we could rely on him running hard and pick up a second or two a lap when we had an open track so that was really the key to the race was him being on the gas all day
7441810 we were able to do great pit stops in and out laps were fantastic
7441811 and as soon as we got the lead it didnt sink in to me
7441812 we havent now really got enough time to prepare him for the arc de triomphe
7441813 maybe i havent had the chance to show him what im about
7441814 i always felt i trained well with england and hopefully hes seen that but im yet to start a game for him
7441815 all i can do is keep knocking on the door by knocking goals in
7441816 this referee must be a celtic fan i was marking mcmanus at the corner and it was just a plain handball it was obvious
7441817 obviously the referees do bottle it because they keep making the same mistakes all the time
7441818 dundee united didnt get that penalty against them last week
7441819 i could have knocked the ref out to be honest
7441820 there wasnt a lot in the game at that point and wed had chances but they seem to get luck like that all the time
7441821 i was surprised that i didnt get booked to be honest because i kept having a go at him all the time
7441822 i dont know exactly why it is but i always feel comfortable here
7441823 i love new york as a city when i missed wimbledon last year i realised how much it meant to me i always want to play great at wimbledon and do well there but just for my personality i think the us open and new york suits me better
7441824 i just think for me this is my best surface ive said it all along i think i play my best tennis here i feel most comfortable on the courts my results have shown that ive always played well in america so i think this is my best chance for winning a slam
7441825 on clay im a very long way off but on the other courts i dont think so each time ive played him on hardcourts ive never felt i was outclassed
7441826 this is my best surface and i think once i do get stronger physically im sure ill beat him
7441827 i dont think you really know whether you are ready or not to reach a grand slam final id like to think that i can take the opportunity when it comes
7441828 i played him ferrer twice i lost to him on clay and beat him on hardcourts a few years ago very comfortably
7441829 hes a tough player but its a long way from playing that match theres a lot of tennis to play before then
7441830 unfortunately weve had to abandon weve had more rain overnight
7441831 there are some patches that are not so much waterlogged but they are false so from a health and safety point of view we had no choice
7441832 kyle moyer and my crew did a great job we started in ninth position and and to get a top 5 finish at a course that is very difficult to pass at is great we need to use this momentum going into belle isle next week and hopefully have a repeat finish
7441833 it was just one of those races there was a pretty clear track most of the time so it worked out
7441834 and that pretty much ended any chance we had of competing for a podium finish its a real shame
7441835 my filly is not getting as much credit for some reason
7441836 they dont mention her but they mention the other two quite a bit i just wish once in awhile theyd mention my horse
7441837 if everything goes well well try the ladys secret because id like to find out if she can run on that racetrack the breeders cup is the goal
7441838 i found a little filling on the tendon on the outside of his left foreleg this morning
7441839 i took him to the track for some exercise and it almost all disappeared but i decided to have a veterinarian look at it
7441840 a small lesion showed and it was decided that he wouldnt run hes too good a horse and though its a small lesion we didnt want to take a chance of making it worse
7441841 i think really well probably come back home and unwind a bit and look at cal cup
7441842 but im not ruling anything out you never know how things change that other horse beat us fair and square but my horse dug in really well
7441843 tonight we come to the end of 16 glorious days which we will cherish forever
7441844 through these games the world learned more about china and china learned more about the rest of the world
7441845 the sky is blue the air is clear the olympics created this image for us but can we sustain it i dont know
7441846 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7441847 but they are a seed of change compared with the situation before
7441848 the world today is in need of mutual understanding inclusiveness cooperation and harmonious development
7441849 the beijing olympic games is a testimony of the fact that the world has its trust rested upon china
7441850 i really hope people remember the friendliness of the chinese our happy attitudes and our welcoming ways
7441851 it will be hard to pick a favorite memory from these games
7441852 hit some big home runs and the walks made the difference
7441853 it was a mental mistake jack does a great job of putting us up and the biggest thing is the first out and i walk johjima and bryan lahair one hit and its all of a sudden a totally different ballgame
7441854 every time we got some runs i would go back out and give it back
7441855 as a starting pitcher thats a terrible feeling to have
7441856 im trying to keep it simple shortening it cutting down on some strikeouts putting the ball in play
7441857 i wasnt able to accomplish what i really wanted which was to stay healthy
7441858 but any time you can overcome an injury and throw up zeros its nice
7441859 a couple of outings in a row joey has thrown the ball real well
7441860 we are still lagging behind in many events and disciplines in terms of medal counts and athletes ranked in the top eight were still lagging behind the u s is still number one and still much more powerful than china
7441861 we consider this one of our most successful engagements in the olympic games ever
7441862 we dont gauge our performances simply on the number of medals we achieve theres unlimited need and limited resources we need more resources
7441863 we need to focus on many sports where we really dont show up
7441864 there are lots of places where there are lots of medals and were not doing as well as we should we have to try to fill in the spots
7441865 i peek at the medal count every now and then
7441866 were all competitive we want to win all the gold medals
7441867 we do look at the medal count we take pride in what we can contribute
7441868 i do the cross to say god give me another opportunity to get a base hit
7441869 i hit my spikes once for my grandmother once for my grandfather once for my sister
7441870 thats his home and he spent a huge part of his career in san diego with that organization
7441871 to come back his first year and get embarrassed in the season series he had to take that with him this offseason im sure theres some vindication hes too much of a pro to admit it
7441872 its my worst birthday so far because im staring 30 in the face
7441873 if he hasnt played in the preseason it would be hard to start him
7441874 theres not a lot of history as far as guys playing in the league besides javon and ronald
7441875 none of those guys has really played before so it would be tough to only go with two guys who have played before
7441876 we have some guys we can count on so well just look to the next guy
7441877 the last cuts some good people are getting let go on some of the good teams
7441878 its as bad as it can get as far as issues with the knee
7441879 i have to remind you guys that its preseason and you guys can figure out what that means
7441880 i do believe that what we instituted three years ago helped us not to crack today
7441881 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being ignorant being individuals
7441882 what you saw today was a team bonding together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7441883 i told coach k after the game thanks for believing in me
7441884 i think they took this tournament very seriously they were very hungry they gave a better feeling of a team it wasnt so much individual stuff individual talent
7441885 du musst da einfach mit deiner ganzes existenz da sei im cockpit und in der familie adsum sagen ich bin ganz da ganz dabei und du darfst das nicht getrennt von einander sehen da der beruf und da die familie und da vielleicht noch die musik oder ein hobby das muss zusammen geh ren das darf einander nicht weh tun eins muss mit dem anderen wachsen
7441886 dem tig sehe wie viele da miteinander wirken m ssen dass so eine maschine jetzt abhebt und dass die naturkr fte so wirken dass die luft auf tr gt
7441887 dem tig davor wie meine frau das alles mit unseren sieben kindern und dem haushalt managt dass das alles einfach so liebevoll l uft
7441888 bei der geburt meines kindes dabei zu sein und das sieben mal
7441889 its not that we didnt play with energy before but weve got a lot of guys who are trying to establish themselves as big league players theyre hungry and excited to be here theres been a different energy
7441890 i dont think anything makes the last six weeks of a losing season better
7441891 hes only had a couple of bad outings lately thats why i wanted to help him so bad to win the game
7441892 hey its my birthday and ill sulk if i want to
7441893 i might try to keep bengie fresher there are times i think ive overworked him with sandoval here i can give bengie more of a break especially when you get into the dog days of august and september it can help him
7441894 we still have a lot of division games left the next month is pretty much all division games a lot against arizona and los angeles two teams that are battling for a playoff spot i think well get a lot better perspective once we go through september
7441895 they were shooting the ball well today and when they get going like that they are tough to stop
7441896 you never want to get in a scoring battle with the hungarians because they are such great shooters we wanted to make it a defensive game but we just didnt get it done
7441897 its going to hurt tonight its going to hurt tomorrow and for a few days but as the weeks and months go by the players are going to realize what a huge accomplishment it is
7441898 nobody expected them to do anything here they had a great run and theyve got a lot to be proud of
7441899 you always got to believe you have a chance to win but when the seconds are ticking down and you realize were going to probably not win this game thats a slap in the face it stings
7441900 we were with them for awhile but they just kept coming and thats why they are three time gold medal champions
7441901 ate here last night check it out before it gets discovered

7441922 see the distribution and illumination of massive primordial hydrogen cloud structures lit up by the high energy radiation coming from nearby stars in the milky way
7441923 i say this respectfully to our chinese hosts who have excelled so magnificently at ping pong
7441924 ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england in the 19th century and it was called whiff whaff
7441925 that is the essential difference between us and the rest of the world other nations the french looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner we looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to play whiff whaff
7441926 that is why london is the sporting capital of the world
7441927 and i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home athletics is coming home sport is coming home

7441931 we are very pleased to continue our support to the united states government in protecting those people and assets that protect our great nation
7441932 we view these operations not as contracts but as missions that support our governmental infrastructure and that is a mission we take very seriously
7441933 there is no doubt in my mind that were going to attract a lot of folks that are interested in serving
7441934 obviously we think we are really really strong in all the communities around the country based on the things we did last year we think we have irreversible momentum right now
7441935 and he was unapologetic about supporting the army national guard recruiting program
7441936 folks need to know that they are doing a lot for this country they are real patriots
7441937 we really tried to set the bar and set the standard for this type of advertising
7441938 we really tried in the last few years starting with three doors down we wanted to get music that really engages people not just a song about the national guard but a cool song that young adults would like to have in their ipod i think we have done that
7441939 you have to hit them in many many different outlets
7441940 when senator obama makes his case to the american people next week its critical that he address the most urgent issues facing the 1 7 million men and women who have served in iraq and afghanistan
7441941 iavas goal is to inject urgent issues like mental health care traumatic brain injury and va funding into the national political dialogue how the next president cares for our countrys newest generation of veterans will have significant long term implications for not only the servicemembers and their families but the nation as a whole
7441942 to be very sincere i think a lot of nigerians and people all over africa imagined that he obama was going to nominate hilary clinton this basically as a result of many factors one of which is the tradition in american politics where you have very serious competition in party primaries the winner normally carries along the loser so that they can forge a common front reassure the unity of the party and party members with a view to facing the opponent in general election
7441943 i agree with you that most likely senator obama must have considered the integrity the political credentials as well as other factors in nominating his running mate but the choice in nigeria was not exactly the same thing because here was a very contrite agenda where the primary itself was not free and fair where the sitting president unilaterally decided who was an aspirant and at the end of it after the presidential candidate was nominated the issue of running mate was announced from the presidential villa so it was not a free political intercourse
7441944 there is the regional issue there is the ethnic issue theres also the religious issue and in the case of goodluck jonathan i think one of the most fundamental consideration had to do with the niger delta crisis especially if we place it within the spectrum of the aggression and the violence that has been taking place by either the youth of the region and those who desire to steal oil from the region
7441945 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here and say look you gotta get this done
7441946 we wanted the federal government to tell the state to act quickly on it

7442028 after levi and barkindo took the lift downstairs the overzealous security men stopped me from making any call to my editors when i asked why they swooped on me with some of them hitting me with their gun butts while the rest pummelled me into the lift and took me down the lobby 11 floors below dr ajuonoma was there again and asked them to throw me out immediately an order they carried out swiftly
7442029 by the time i was out of the nnpc building i had pains around my ribs and a sprained left elbow from the twisting it received i strongly believe that there is something very uncanny and sinister that the nnpc is desperately trying to conceal by intimidating those who dare to ask questions

7442039 it will be a proud moment to see the unedited version the smart graceful harvard educated lawyer mother and supportive spouse
7442040 the muttering you hear is that she has a little too much edge

7442047 i think it would be wrong of me because its very complex human issues that are involved in this she said
7442048 this is about a child and an adoptive family thats gone out of its way and done their best to give a child a new life and to make a family
7442049 equally there are birth parents who have equally suffered so the ultimate outcome here is one that i dont think any of us can know yet
7442050 younger children are more likely to fall their judgment and depth perception are not developed and they are very impulsive once the stairs are there they dont necessarily go down the way they came up
7442051 unless you are watching your kids every minute they can climb up on the bunk bed and in a matter of seconds fall

7442061 the past one and a half years of yaraduas presidency were marred with indolence ineptitude violence kidnapping armed robbery communal clashes power blackout and succumbing to the whims and caprices of a cabal holding the nation to ransom

7442070 if you take billions of dollars out of it then youve got to be able to say where you would elsewise get that money
7442071 i think its much better to have some constructive dialogue going on rather than telling people who are properly elected to this national pprliament by the people of australia to get out of the way senator brown said
7442072 the idea that the government is elected to do what it wants was found to be unpopular

7442083 the key thing for us is to make the education revolution real for all kids including those kids where school attendance is a real problem
7442084 obviously there cant be an education revolution for kids if theyre not at school and we are determined to make sure across australia that they are attending schools properly
7442085 it just adds further trouble particularly this one because most of the people affected would be families that are already struggling because they are on welfare
7442086 to cut them off will only cause further homelessness problems and further family conflict
7442087 there has to be what you would describe as reasonable grounds for being absent
7442088 the kid who is away for days on end without a medical certificate or without any other reasonable presentation of grounds those measures will kick in

7442096 with colorado among at least seven battleground states that will swing this presidential election an obama lead here puts enormous pressure on john mccain
7442097 should obama go on to win colorado it would almost force mccain to run the table with the remaining battleground states or lose the election
7442098 the notion and significance of democrats irreparably disaffected by the tough primary fight between obama and new york senator hillary clinton seems to be more of an obsession with the beltway chattering classes than with the electorate

7442112 tentu saja itu salah satu alasannya tapi yang pasti memakai jilbab dan baju panjang seperti ini adalah keinginanku sejak dulu mama hanya berkata aku boleh memakai ini jika aku sudah memiliki iman yang kuat oh ya tentang pertanyaanmu tadi itu mungkin benar aku memang sengaja menutup rapat auratku agar orang tak melihatku sebatas fisik saja aku ingin mereka melihat diriku lebih dalam dan dengan begini daya tarikku akan berkurang kan sehingga mereka tidak menganggapku sempurna lagi lagipula aku tak suka orang melihatku dari luar saja dan pasti banyak orang yang hanya melihatku dari fisik aku tak suka sikap mereka itu jadi aku merubah penampilanku

7442116 rendi aku nggak tau masih berapa lama waktuku hidup di dunia ini sebenarnya aku masih ingin menikmati ciptaan allah yang semata untuk menguji umatnya aku tahu umurku nggak panjang lagi karena aku tak kunjung mendapatkan menstruasi aku tak kunjung dapat melakukan operasi penyakitku semakin terasa menyakitkan dan aku hanya dapat meminum obat penawar sementara tapi sungguh aku ingin membantu orang orang yang selalu sedih dengan yang mereka rasakan tapi aku tak pernah dapat membantu siapa siapa aku bukan umat allah yang diinginkan aku tak dapat berdiri tegak dan selalu tersenyum pada banyak orang aku ini gadis yang sangat lemah tak ada yang mengharapkan kelemahanku ini aku solat dan mengaji setiap hari berharap itu akan sedikit menyampaikan keinginanku kepada allah semua yang kulakukan semata agar allah dapat tersenyum melihatku tapi aku nggak bisa mengabulkan keinginan nya aku nggak bisa rendi
7442117 nggak kamu hebat kamu adalah gadis terhebat yang pernah kutemui kamu adalah gadis yang paling tegar yang pernah aku kenal kamu adalah gadis yang paling memiliki niat yang sangat besar untuk membantu orang kamu harus sadar jika hidupmu itu sempurna jika semua dapat kamu lakukan penyakitmu ini hanya ujian dari kesempurnaan yang kamu miliki kamu harus yakin jika kamu masih dapat melakukan sesuatu untuk menolong orang tanpa harus mengorbankan penderitaanmu kamu dapat tersenyum membantu orang di tempat ini

7442119 aku memiliki dua buah gantungan yang sama seperti yang sekarang ada di tanganmu dulu aku berfikir untuk memberikannya padamu satu dan untukku satu tapi beberapa bulan yang lalu setelah novel ketigaku terbit seorang gadis jauh jauh dari jakarta hanya untuk bertemu denganku dengan antusias ia memelukku erat ia sangat bersemangat bertemu denganku ia memujiku habis habisan
7442120 gadis itu sangat hiperaktif sangat pintar sangat cantik sangat kuat keimanannya dan ia sangat pintar memotivasi orang saat pertama kami bertemu aku merasa telah mengenalnya ia bercerita mengenai dirinya sendiri padaku ia bercerita seakan akan ia adalah tokoh utama dari ketiga buku yang kubuat dia bilang aku adalah satu satunya orang yang dapat membuat cerita seperti yang dirasakan banyak orang dia bilang aku mengajarkannya sebuah kesempurnaan yang tak akan dimiliki siapapun sehebat apapun mereka dan ia bilang kalau ia sangat menghormatiku sebagai satu satunya orang yang dapat memotivasinya aku sangat senang dalam hatiku aku sangat terharu ada orang yang menjadi penggemarku dengan menceritakan secara runtut apa yang ia rasakan bahkan dalam keadaan yang sesempurna itupun ia berkata ia ingin menjadi sepertiku katanya aku lebih hebat dari apa yang ia miliki dan setelah aku mendengarnya bercerita panjang lebar hingga aku tak bisa memotong aku memberikan gantungan kunci satunya pada gadis itu
7442121 tiqfa kamu tak perlu memaksakan diri untuk bercerita seperti itu padaku kamu cukup istirahat saja
7442122 nggak aku nggak bisa tak meneruskannya aku merasa gadis itu seperti diriku jika aku tak selema ini tapi sekarang aku tak takut jika hidupku tak lebih lama dari ini karena gantungan itu adalah kunci keberadaanku jika suatu saat kalian bertemu aku ingin gadis itu dapat menggantikanku tapi aku sama sekali tak ingin kamu merasa ia adalah penggantiku karena ia berbeda denganku hari itu ia mengatakan hal hal yang paling tak ia sukai dan semua yang tak ia sukai adalah yang banyak orang inginkan itu adalah kelebihannya jadi aku tak ingin seorang pun merasa kehilanganku aku sudah sangat puas dapat membantu banyak orang dengan ceritaku rasanya aku tak takut untuk pergi karena aku juga menemukan gadis yang akan jadi lebih hebat dariku aku harap akan ada kehidupan yang lebih sempurna dari ini tapi mungkin bukan disini
7442123 kamu ngomong apa sih kamu harus berusaha agar kamu dapat menjalankan hidupmu lagi kamu jangan menye
7442124 ya aku sama sekali tak berfikir untuk menyerah tapi aku hanya melakukan apa yang dapat kulakukan dan aku yakin pasti ada sesuatu yang tak dapat kulakukan hingga aku harus bertawakal sebentar lagi aku tak dapat untuk melakukan apa yang tak bisa kupertahankan tapi aku sudah menyisakan senyum di benak banyak orang dan itu adalah penghargaan paling berarti dalam kehidupanku aku berharap tak seorang pun bersedih karena aku tak seorang pun merasa kehilanganku aku akan ada di hati semua orang yang mengenalku dan aku pasti berharap mereka akan tersenyum

7442413 in 2003 the government owned ntpc floated a tender asking for potential suppliers of 12 mmscmd of natural gas for its proposed power plants at kawas and gandhar for a period of 17 years
7442414 since the ntpc deal happened at around the same time in early 2004 it was agreed that ril would supply 28 mmscmd of gas to reliance energys
7442415 ril appealed this and one of the arguments being made is that the family settlement was signed by mukesh as a member of the ambani family and not by ril
7442416 such is the state of the governments support to ntpc that while anil ambani has got a stay preventing ril from selling what he says is his share of the gas and has won one round in court the ntpc case is proceeding at a snails pace

7442419 the 376th air expeditionary wing provided two large fire trucks an ambulance and nearly two dozen medical and fire and crash support personnel to the scene of the accident
7442420 medical personnel have also been requested to provide support at the manas international airport terminal which is adjacent to the base
7442421 whenever i do the scene i get emotional about my mother whom i lost last year
7442422 intelligent and energetic enough to do well in so exalted a position as prime minister but fifteen years ago there would have been some question about his judgment
7442423 malcolm turnbull is clearly a person of great ability and should the opportunity arise and he does become the leader of the liberal party hed make a very fine leader of the liberal party
7442424 his demeanour was probably a cross between napoleon and churchill
7442425 malcolm turnbull was this utter force of nature so when youre on the wrong end of malcolm its terrifying the thunder in the face and often the quite spontaneous even over the top tongue lashing
7442426 there was irritation there was annoyance there was if you just shut up and listen to me youll understand why im right and youre completely wrong
7442427 prancing around like some character out of an oscar wilde play
7442428 is one of those people who seems destined for great things
7442429 hes very determined hes very focussed and at his best he can be a remarkably charming and genial companion
7442430 at his worst malcolm can be a bit of a volcano
7442431 there were misgivings i mean you know the question was and there were a lot of people who would describe themselves as malcolms greatest supporters and they asked the question they were entitled to ask the question how do you think hell go will he be able to cope with the fundamental change from a corporate to a political setting
7442432 i go back to the point that here is someone who does not suffer fools gladly that can mean a number of things i think in politics it means being dismissive
7442433 malcolm doesnt propose to add another comment to the many and varied accounts of that particularly complicated and colourful transaction
7442434 it is important to note however that malcolm was not acting for mr packer in that deal in fact malcolms clients the us bondholders had very different and at times competing interests with those of mr packer and mr black
7442435 done with some melodrama turnbull said to westerway i fear for myself my family my career
7442436 the great fear at the time was that he was packers stooge and malcolm turnbull is nobodys stooge
7442437 i think that is what that incident absolutely reveals he says he was acting in the interests of his client but it was a high risk strategy putting him at odds with kerry packer a man he had worked for
7442438 it was good to hear from you and i remember four corners with some amusement malcolm was a skilled negotiator i knew him as an aggressive and opportunistic lawyer
7442439 kerry thought he was talented and energetic but impetuous and unpredictable i can only comment on his aptitude to be prime minister from my recollection of him i think he is certainly intelligent and energetic enough to do well in so exalted a position but fifteen years ago there would have been some question about his judgment that may no longer be the case i would be pleased if our paths crossed again i hope this is of some use best wishes to you yours conrad black

7442498 the world has not forgotten the people of this land today we are all from gaza
7442499 we recognize that were two humble boats but what weve accomplished is to show that average people from around the world can mobilize to create change we do not have to stay silent in the face of injustice reaching gaza today there is such a sense of hope and hope is what mobilizes people everywhere
7442500 were the first ones in 41 years to enter gaza freely but we wont be the last we welcome the world to join us and see what were seeing
7442501 what weve done shows that people can do what governments should have done if people stand up against injustice we can truly be the conscience of the world
7442502 we will make sure that this provocation is not taking place
7442503 its about human rights to let palestinians and visitors travel freely to and from palestinian lands what could be more basic than that

7442505 the siege that the israelis have imposed on gaza is not only illegal in terms of international law it is also immoral

7442508 there is this slow genocide going on in gaza and nobody is taking any notice

7442510 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7442511 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7442512 joe biden believes the war was a mistake mccain would still do it all over again biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden
7442513 john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today

7442519 there is some worry that i might be a lightning rod
7442520 some of it is because i challenged the system at guant namo
7442521 i can see why muslims wanted to go underground after 9 11
7442522 but i have found that if you speak up in politics you can have a positive influence
7442523 by far the strongest advocate for following the geneva conventions for habeas corpus for following the constitution for everyone and for reaching out to all faiths
7442524 that theyll now read from the quran at a national political convention that shows we have come a long way in this country
7442525 i dont know how much of that will be filled with words as opposed to applause kidding kidding
7442526 the stuff thats on television in the main hall is a small part of what actually goes on
7442527 how many people out there are saying the economy is the number 1 issue its a bunch
7442528 its clearly a continuing rise in her napolitanos trajectory as a noted democratic leader shes breathing rarified air
7442529 i dont think its news to anyone that dollars are scarce when the country is spending 2 5 billion a week on the war it really hits home funding for infrastructure funding for education as sad as it sounds all of these areas are really pushed if this is to be a priority i will work on it but its tight everything is tight
7442530 indisputably this nation was founded as a republic and its leaders were justifiably afraid of a democracy lest it destroy the nation they had risked their lives to establish
7442531 the full and permanent restoration of the constitution and the bill of rights as their authors intended them
7442532 real liberty is neither found in despotism or the extremes of democracy but in moderate government
7442533 a democracy is a state in which the poor gaining the upper hand kill some and banish others and then divide the offices among the remaining citizens equally
7442534 the common people feel themselves oppressed by the grasping of some and their vanity is flattered by others fired with evil passions they are no longer willing to submit to control but demand that everything be subject to their authority the invariable result is that government assumes the noble names of free and popular but becomes in fact the most execrable thing mob rule
7442535 our chief danger arises from the democratic parts of our constitutions
7442536 real liberty is neither found in despotism or the extremes of democracy but in moderate government
7442537 the evils we experience flow from the excess of democracy the people do not want virtue but are the dupes of pretended patriots
7442538 it has been observed that a pure democracy if it were practicable would be the most perfect government experience has proved that no position is more false than this the ancient democracies in which the people themselves deliberated never possessed one feature of good government their very character was tyranny their figure deformity
7442539 democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths
7442540 remember democracy never lasts long it soon wastes exhausts and murders itself there never was a democracy yet that did not commit suicide
7442541 democracies have ever been spectacles of turbulence and contention have ever been found incompatible with personal security or the rights of property and have in general been as short in their lives as they have been violent in their deaths
7442542 in questions of power then let no more be heard of confidence in man but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution
7442543 we are all democrats we are democratic republicans and democratic federalist
7442544 there are few positions more demonstrable than that there should be in every republic some permanent body to correct the prejudices check the intemperate passions and regulate the fluctuations of a popular assembly
7442545 it is of great importance in a republic not only to guard against the oppression of its rulers but to guard one part of society against the injustice of the other part
7442546 the destiny of the republican model of government is justly considered as deeply perhaps as finally stacked on the experiment entrusted to the hands of the american people
7442547 the republican is the only form of government which is not eternally at open or secret war with the rights of mankind
7442548 government in a well constituted republic requires no belief from man beyond what his reason authorizes
7442549 the body of the american people is substantially republican but their virtuous feelings have been played upon by some fact with more fiction they have been the dupes of artful manoeuvres amp made for a moment to be willing instruments in forging chains for themselves
7442550 if there be any among us who would wish to dissolve this union or to change its republican form
7442551 the body of our people have ever had the same object in view to wit the maintenance of a federal republican government
7442552 this is my belief of it it is that on which i have acted to administer the government according to its genuine republican principles
7442553 he john adams author has since thoroughly seen that his constituents were devoted to republican government
7442554 and i fondly hope that the motto of the standard to which our country will forever rally will be federal union and republican government
7442555 at no time at no place in solemn convention assembled through no chosen agents had the american people officially proclaimed the united states to be a democracy the constitution did not contain the word or any word lending countenance to it except possibly the mention of we the people in the preamble when the constitution was framed no respectable person called himself a democrat
7442556 democracy a government of the masses authority derived through mass meeting or any form of direct expression results in mobocracy attitude towards laws is that the will of the majority shall regulate whether it is based upon deliberation or governed by passion prejudice or impulse without restraint or regard to consequences results in demagogism license agitation discontent anarchy
7442557 the absence of hereditary or arbitrary class distinctions or privileges
7442558 those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it
7442559 i dont know lil but this guy did something really bad to the redhead woman and i think she is about to kill him i dont know its hard to follow

7442567 indian team was worried when jayawrdene and thushara were scoring runs
7442568 having a fifth bowler is a luxury we have to make do with four bowlers but we have bowlers like yuvraj raina and virat who can bowl we needed one extra batsman
7442569 earlier india had batsmen who could play till the end and i could go for big shots early i am however happy that i still have strike rate of 90 thougu i would have been happier to have a strike rate of over hundred
7442570 when you are scoring centuries you dont ask these questions every batsman has highs and lows the idea of playing sangakkara as opener is to have some senior batsman to get more balls to play
7442571 tough position to be in it is a challenging situation playing at home do not want to lose series we know where we are going wrong

7442573 we are pleased to report an 11 3 increase in ridleys annual ebita for fiscal 2008 all of our divisions in the u s and canada reported strong winter demand particularly in the third quarter of the year which contributed to good profit margins and net income notwithstanding the claim settlement
7442574 i think all this seeming chaos is a result of the open ness we are all experiencing after march 8 a lot more issues are coming to the surface now and people are airing their views a lot more freely just because we disagree with each other does not mean we want to destroy each other this is democracy in action

7442588 government law enforcement intelligence and security agencies are planning to treat dissidents like potential terrorists because of a reliance on flawed research hyperbolic assessments and political bias

7442603 a little bit of deal or no deal a sprinkle of who wants to be a millionaire and a hint of the price is right
7442604 why should we care about what goes on around the world
7442605 maybe the agenda item wasnt submitted necessarily to deceive us
7442606 most of the senators have enough common sense to understand the situation
7442607 everything started off equal but soon i found that i was doing most of the cleaning and frank had a nasty habit of leaving wet towels on my bed
7442608 figure out how each of you deals with conflict have very clear rules and get enough alone time
7442609 were all adults so i thought they would be responsible enough to pay the rent and clean up after themselves
7442610 the other girl didnt even tell me she had a baby i discovered her 1 year old the first day she moved in after the baby threw up on my carpet to make things worse she was unemployed
7442611 do background checks credit checks and get everyone to sign on the lease so that everyone is responsible for paying rent
7442612 jacob hales embodies the spirit of this award in the fullest sense and he is a very deserving winner
7442613 i know his coaches and teammates cant wait to get him back on the field
7442614 its more of an acquired taste but some people wear it as a badge of honor

7442621 metro asked iss we need help with the public so the public is aware of what is suspicious activity and who would they call if they see something
7442622 the dvd is open to the public first in nevada
7442623 it will be available in english and in spanish its also going across the country to other entities looking for increased security and surveillance
7442624 neither the dvd nor the opening of the fusion centers is the function of any known or anticipated action that is focused on nevada or on clark county
7442625 i think thats great because people need to be informed
7442626 its great that the school is actually doing something about it
7442627 i think awareness of homeland security and anti terrorism is a good thing
7442628 this conflict really stretches back to the end of the 18th century beginning of the 19th century
7442629 it is really broken up into different regions based on majority ethnic subgroups
7442630 it worries me because we already have troops in the middle east
7442631 i hope we can remain as neutral in this conflict as possible so other hostilities dont arise
7442632 american involvement in this conflict will largely be determined by president george w bush and condoleezza rice
7442633 the georgians remain close to the u s there are close links between the bush administration and georgia
7442634 diplomatically speaking this conflict is part of an ongoing rivalry between the u s and russia
7442635 the u s supports georgias application to nato while russia is vehemently opposed also russia has been very vocal about u s efforts to install anti ballistic missile systems in eastern and central europe
7442636 they are too small to fight off the much larger russia
7442637 if the u s supports georgias entry into nato they should back them up with more than a ceasefire
7442638 we cant start sending troops into georgia right away because we need to watch russias actions and see if they do the right thing
7442639 in all honesty these issues have erupted over the entire history of our world
7442640 im not saying send in troops and im not saying stand back and watch georgia burn but the united states is in no place to put their foot on another part of the world
7442641 obviously russia is more important for the u s in terms of economic and security relations but georgia is symbolically crucial as a nascent democracy
7442642 the perfect solution from the american point of view is a return to the pre invasion status quo
7442643 the main thing is that were working to create social justice and that social justice is multifaceted
7442644 theres many dimensions theres many layers one is race class gender sexuality etc you cant just look at one side of it you have to look at all
7442645 whether that spark leads them to learn more about the processes that i went over for them to become activists for immigrant rights or whether that spark leads them to critically review their opinions about immigration

7442647 in the short run it would make me happy to go outside and play
7442648 in the long run it would make me happy to do well in school and be successful
7442649 but in the very long run i know which will make the better memories
7442650 we have the responsibility to do better than weve been doing
7442651 we need to do things we should have been doing all along
7442652 gov jim gibbons has quite properly and reasonably in every way directed us to submit a budget that meets the declining state revenues that reflect our states current highly unusual economic contraction
7442653 we should do our duty and serve the real public interest by delivering just such a budget
7442654 theres absolutely no point in cutting our own thoughts before we need to
7442655 i take great offense to any implication that we run around like elitists saying no we shouldnt be cut because were a state institution and we shouldnt be cut i dont think thats what were saying
7442656 all i know is if a woman ever becomes president ill jump off a bridge
7442657 batman then avails himself of compromised bushian means to achieve a secure and orderly end
7442658 he does this in part by spying on everyones cellular phone conversations he also tortures the joker in frantic pursuit of vital information

7442660 what i love about poetry is the purity of it the sound and shape of words on the air pure sounds that nevertheless have meaning one of the things i hate in life is having
7442661 he is one of the great teachers of poetry in the country who is talked about everywhere were very happy to have him
7442662 the community of students at unlv is incredibly diverse providing the opportunity to talk to different kinds of students
7442663 youre going to be doing this for the rest of your life might as well enjoy it after all suffering is vastly overrated as revell is prone to say
7442664 occasionally when a university hires such a capable figure they expect them to hole up in their offices with the door locked and the lights out assuming theyve been hired for their reputation and not to actually work with students
7442665 so much of what dr revell brings to any atmosphere is his charisma from his self deprecating humor to his uproarious enthusiasm hes masterful at putting large groups of people at ease
7442666 it was now late goethe gave me his dear hand and i departed
7442667 the purpose of this summit is to accelerate the development of renewable energy to set an agenda
7442668 thats an agenda that would choke a horse but thats what its about
7442669 we believe there is a desperate need to solve the energy crisis
7442670 there is no question we have a real security problem importing 70 percent of our oil
7442671 we need something that will bridge us to electric and hydrogen
7442672 help demonstrate to the rest of the world this is not an affectation for wealthy countries
7442673 if you could do it be completely energy independent no one would doubt it could be done
7442674 i promise you if you do it it would rock the world
7442675 i thought it would be a great opportunity to give back to unlv and my fellow students

7442683 its my worst birthday so far because im staring 30 in the face
7442684 the truth is shes a girl who cant help anyone not even herself

7442699 there is no document of civilization which is not at the same time a document of barbarism
7442700 you know that a serious scandal breaks out almost every two weeks they need to focus on the name issue because the government is faced with early elections due to the scandals
7442701 they are structuring their policy in such a way that they can avoid finding a solution because they believe it will damage them in the next elections
7442702 the intransigent and provocative comments by mr gruevski go beyond all reason
7442703 it confirms the untenable position in which he has chosen to put himself
7442704 i told mr nimetz that it would be best for him to think again and to press the other side over something that would be a compromise a dual name
7442705 one of the ideas mr nimetz expressed was the use of one name internationally for us this is not acceptable and that is where we left it
7442706 we cannot blame the increase in orders for new ships by greek residents which contributes to a larger trade deficit and by extension current account deficit for the loss of competitiveness of the greek economy
7442707 the deficit is more a function of savings and spending than anything else
7442708 their requests are in line with the law they simply want to have the same rights as other citizens
7442709 we expect that premier dodik will help us in line with the law to overcome this death of citizens rights and to get back to normal life

7442762 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile

7442780 not to the best of my recollection but there is material being gathered by the department about the child concerned so there may well be something that i dont recall but as youll appreciate it is a long time ago she said
7442781 i think it would be wrong of me because its very complex human issues that are involved in this she said
7442782 this is about a child and an adoptive family thats gone out of its way and done their best to give a child a new life and to make a family
7442783 at the time the impact of the campaign was closely monitored and it was estimated that about 190 000 australians quit smoking she told reporters in melbourne today
7442784 very few health programs save more than they cost but the ntc did she said
7442785 when this campaign was launched 10 years ago it was the first time that smokers really saw real life situations of what happened to their bodies as a result of their habit fiona sharkie executive director of quit victoria said
7442786 in three of those four were awaiting senate inquiry outcomes thats the sensible thing to do he said in canberra
7442787 the governments got its budget and it wants to get it through in the main senator brown said
7442788 if you take billions of dollars out of it then youve got to be able to say where you would elsewise get that money
7442789 i think its much better to have some constructive dialogue going on rather than telling people who are properly elected to this national pprliament by the people of australia to get out of the way senator brown said
7442790 the idea that the government is elected to do what it wants was found to be unpopular
7442791 maybe the prime minister hasnt yet got a good bead on where the greens are coming from senator brown said
7442792 my main goal is to see every child succeed on and off the stage i like to give them an environment that is challenging but can build the students confidence by showing them that they can produce musicals above their age level with hard work and dedication anything is possible in my years as the performing arts director for mt bethel elementary school i have seen huge changes in the professionalism of the students they want to do their best and i like creating the atmosphere for them to do so my favorite teacher and a great friend once told me if you are doing what is best for kids then you are doing the right thing that is where my passion and drive comes from i want to give kids the opportunity to create the best production that they have ever been in and be proud of themselves for accomplishing it
7442793 we take pride in our productions and the way they can build self esteem in every child
7442794 going to a football match has become like going to a business meeting its too corporate having a season ticket has become a status symbol
7442795 ive got all sorts in my team accountants drivers bricklayers a couple of unemployed lads and a model they get paid about 80 a week so they can relate to our fans the professional game has gone too far how can you have players earning 150 000 a week it is so far detached from reality it is ridiculous were not in the entertainment business were a football club
7442796 we dont model our playing style on united but we like to get the ball down and play
7442797 our supporters have given up watching some of the best in the world to drop down and watch us so it would be hypocritical for me to go
7442798 it seems that i already have these file but where
7442799 cut the official policy rate too fast and too far and risked its reputation for being serious about inflation
7442800 lenders have been hit by a shock so severe that they are contracting and withdrawing from private sector lending
7442801 these hawks at the fed are arguing in effect that we have to throw people out of work more quickly than we already are to insure against inflation
7442802 michael was the first outsider i talked to about it
7442803 he told me my only real goal is to leave the sport bigger and better than i found it
7442804 but with 4 a gallon gas more people were staying home many fewer were taking vacations

7442819 it is ludicrous to extend the peaceline at a time when we want to see closer co operation between the two communities

7442831 e facile trasformarli in un clich visto tutti i libri e i film sui vampiri degli ultimi centanni ma questi non sono vampiri convenzionali non ne hanno laspetto e non muoiono allo stesso modo quindi ho cercato di semplificare al massimo ti mordono e diventi anche tu un vampiro diventi immortale e hai una forza sovrumana eccetera e neppure tu sai il perch

7442842 we completely agree with micks comments regarding the celebration product we started selling this item in january and it outsells absolutely everything else by 50

7442846 i knew tindol motorsports gave me a great car so my main concern was the start and the opening lap
7442847 for some reason i dont get away too well in the front wheel drive
7442848 this track is outstanding its the best track theres no chicanes its all out when i come up here it just suits my style of driving and i love racing here
7442849 it would have been a tindol first second the tindol guys have worked really hard and to be up here with realtime who are an icon in the sport anyone in this series measures themselves against them im so happy we could put tindol up here
7442850 we had another one like that at mid ohio side by side sort of thing its a dream come true to race against peter i have a lot of respect for him and it feels good to come out on top of this one
7442851 in the last corner i was having flashbacks to watkins glen there for a second with bmws spinning in front of me i had to keep my foot in it i looked in my mirrors to see if peter went down a gear to try and pass me its just disappointing for mazda i think it was a bit of an optimistic move and in the end it cost mazda the championship but mazda will be back next year and run for the championship again
7442852 i still pinch myself every time i get to the track and see the car with my name on it
7442853 it feels great to be here and i cant thank mazda enough for this opportunity we all know how hard it is to move up the ladder these days in racing and i cant say enough about mazdas program
7442854 im sure jason saini and i both felt we were fighting for the fourth position but if that had been the actual finish then acura wouldnt have clinched the manufacturers championship
7442855 but because of what the final lap antics were all of a sudden jason and i are on the podium and acura clinches its unprecedented seventh manufacturers championship as a little side benefit im in the points lead as it was unfolding i wasnt sure where seth and chip would be going but it worked out and we crossed the stripe

7442877 i wrote down quadratic equations before we built the catapult but until i built and launched it i didnt really understand
7442878 parabolas are everywhere in science technology and when you shoot a catapult
7442879 when you launch an object out of a catapult it follows a parabolic path
7442880 back in the day the purpose of studying the quadratic equation was to study the effective use of weaponry
7442881 people used catapults up until world war i which the kids were studying in their history class when it was a tool for trench warfare
7442882 i knew if they were left to their own devices theyd surprise me with great designs
7442883 if you know where the egg is going you can plan to hit targets at a variety of heights and distances based on that one equation
7442884 the catapult was working but i thought what about tension
7442885 textbooks are great but they dont give you the visual
7442886 you have to go through a process of how parabolas are created take the data plug it into a quadratic equation and analyze it
7442887 i think this is a great way to motivate students
7442888 since it is a fun project it becomes relevant to them which makes the teaching and learning much much easier
7442889 it took multiple steps it fell apart a couple of times we misplaced some of our materials but the end result is it launches
7442890 creating a catapult was not only fun it was the best learning experience ive ever had
7442891 with a textbook its in one ear and out the other but with the catapult because its hands on it has stuck with me it was the process playing with it trying to get to the goal to make that perfect parabola

7442893 the actual site of david in the centre of town is logistically unfortunate it would be beneficial for everyone to move it so that the tourist area can be enlarged and decongested

7442895 everything is up for discussion and everything has its time i dont believe that the question of david will be among our immediate priorities

7442897 janganlah aku mendapatkan kamu mendatangi suatu kaum sedang mereka dalam pembicaraannya lalu kamu memberikan kisahmu pada mereka dan memotong pembicaraan mereka dengannya maka kamu telah membuat mereka bosan namun duduk dan diamlah apabila mereka memintamu memberi nasihat maka berilah nasihat dimana mereka akan mendengarkannya

7442941 wir werden die banken warnen dass bestimmte vorgehensweisen nicht akzeptabel sind und wenn es rechtzeitig zu nderungen kommt sind wir zufrieden
7442942 charakterlich passt biden in die change mentalit t im demokratischen lager anders als obama kann der katholik mit seiner arbeiterklassen herkunft und passender rhetorik genau bei diesen w hlern punkten als mann f rs grobe ist biden in der lage in den umk mpften bundesstaaten pennsylvania michigan und ohio die entscheidenden stimmen zu bringen
7442943 barack obama ist mit 47 noch jung joe biden mit 65 schon ein alter hase im polit raumschiff washington der eine will antreten den amerikanern ihren glauben an sich selbst zur ckzugeben und sie an diesem aufbruch zu beteiligen der andere muss daf r sorgen dass auch die brige welt diesen glauben zur ckgewinnt insofern sind barack obama und joseph biden ein vielversprechendes team flapsig gesagt biden ist die bessere hillary den beiden bleibt nicht viel zeit sich als team zu pr sentieren immerhin ist biden bekannt daf r dass er seine gegner nicht schont john mccain kann sich schon mal w rmer anziehen wenn biden das pfund angriffslust einbringt das den demokraten bisher fehlte k nnte obama das steuer noch herumrei en
7442944 joe biden ging sang und klanglos unter als die basis der us demokraten im marathon der primaries die spreu vom weizen trennte er ist kein mann der berzeugend den wandel verk rpert den obama verspricht dazu ist er einfach zu lange im gesch ft und es war nicht joe biden der fast die h lfte seiner partei hinter sich brachte das war hillary clinton die knappe verliererin des vorwahlduells hillary an der seite obamas das w re das dream team gewesen biden ist bei allen st rken nur der ersatzkandidat
7442945 dass er nicht hillary clinton zur vize macht ist ein selbstbewusstes zeichen er muss zwar wahlzur ckhaltung der clinton fans f rchten wichtiger aber ist nicht als ferngesteuerter kandidat am g ngelband der clintons dazustehen joe biden ist eine gute wahl als vize er bringt anders als obama au enpolitische erfahrung mit und spricht als spross einer arbeiterfamilie w hlerschichten an die den wenig volksn he ausstrahlenden obama kritisch be ugen dass biden obama aber k rzlich als nicht reif f r das pr sidentenamt einstufte wird die republikanische wahlkampfmaschine gen sslich ausschlachten und man fragt sich wie obama weiter seine vage botschaft vom wandel unters volk bringen will denn senator biden ist seit langem ein ma geblicher vertreter des washingtoner politik betriebes
7442946 mit blick auf die ffentlichkeit hat sich obama f r einen mitstreiter entschieden der fehlende erfahrung ausgleicht mit dem er als schwarzer im konservativen teil amerikas punkten will die strategische entscheidung birgt gefahren weil mccain seine eigene politische reife unterstreichen wird er selbst alle felder abdeckt nach dem ersten jubel geht es f r obama jetzt ans eingemachte

7442958 5 out of 6 users could not create accounts because they could not find the create account button
7442959 i feel that the great problem is how to make good things in the present state of society
7442960 the great need of our time is for the artist craftsman note only to produce his own good work but also to ally himself closely with the artisan so that eventually we may have beauty in common things again
7442961 the discerning eye which is the faculty of the artist is not being called into use
7442962 the eye of knowledge cannot thereby see beauty what is the beauty that a man of erudition sees as he holds a fine pot in his hands if he picks a wild flower to pieces petal by petal and counts them and tries to put them together again can he regain the beauty that was there
7442963 one cannot replace the function of seeing with the function of knowing one may be able to turn intuition into knowledge but one cannot produce intuition out of knowledge
7442964 there are many ways of seeing but the truest and best is with the intuition for it takes in the whole whereas the intellect only take in a part
7442965 pattern is born when one reproduces the intuitively perceived essence when the intuition weakens pattern becomes no more than a formal design design as such is no more than an intellectual composition the decay of this capacity of pattern making today is due to a loss of the intuitive faculty
7442966 a pattern is a picture of the essence of an object an objects very life its beauty is of that life in fact it would be truer to say that its beauty is that life staring the pattern maker in the face
7442967 how is it that one sees the bamboo in the pattern because the essence of bamboo is there just as prolonged boiling renders a concentrated flavor the process of making a pattern out of raw materials is similar it is an extract so when we look at a god pattern we perceive something of greater content
7442968 dont try to create a product for everybody because that is a product for nobody
7442969 what would happen if you gave the marketing budget for your next three products to the designers could you afford a world class architect designer sculptor director author
7442970 the japanese have invented some truly useful words one of them is otaku otaku describes something thats more than a hobby but a little less than an obsession you must somehow connect with passionate early adopters and get those adopters to spread the word through the curve theyre the ones who will take the time to learn about your product take the risk to try your product and take their friends time to tell them about it
7442971 find the market niche first and then make the remarkable product not the other way around
7442972 i dont know who discovered water but it wasnt a fish
7442973 1 it tells the gop and the american public that barack obama feels weak on foreign policy
7442974 it removes biden from consideration as sec of state which far better suits him
7442975 it prevents us from grooming anyone to follow a possible obama administration
7442976 it brings no geographical area into play with the possible exception of pa where biden was born
7442977 it cuts against the main themes of the obama campaign change and judgment biden voted for the war
7442978 i know what im doing on national security and the economy but if my vp disagrees with me well have a discussion and ill listen with an open mind
7442979 n obody will feel safer voting for obama because biden is the vp
7442980 who the hell is this guy hes been a senator for 4 years does he know what hes doing is he going to be able to stand up to putin and ahmadinejad is he even really a patriotic american
7442981 so just who will be answering the phone in the middle of the night we need a president not merely a man who wants to be president
7442982 we have banned tehreek e taleban pakistan because of their involvement in a series of suicide attacks
7442983 they themselves have claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks and the government cannot engage in a dialogue with such people
7442984 now i can live with my children i can move and go anywhere
7442985 i havent got any plans to get married yet but i would like to
7442986 if recent russian actions are any indicator a technical excuse to completely block us access to the iss for geopolitical reasons would fit nicely into the kremlin toolkit
7442987 almost immediately after the czech republic signed an agreement with the us to place missile defense tracking radar in its territory oil supplies through the druzhba pipeline to the central european country were reduced to a trickle ostensibly for technical reasons
7442988 in an election year it was going to be very difficult to get that waiver to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to an increasingly aggressive russia
7442989 degrade and burn up on rentry or with us ceding it to those who can get there
7442990 if anything at all in that five years period goes wrong with the russian soyuz then we have no system to access the space station
7442991 while it is possible that government to government issues could potentially have an impact on other aspects of a relationship between nations including cooperative space exploration activities nasa believes that it will be able to rely upon roscosmos provided soyuz vehicles for future space station activities
7442992 as long as russia can be said to be abiding by the terms of the cease fire in georgia
7442993 there is an issue but i dont think its so strong to prevent the waiver from passing as long as russian behavior is what it has been agreed to on georgia
7442994 if the situation with russia gets much worst then its very hard to project what might happen because again there is really no viable alternative
7442995 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7442996 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7442997 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7442998 in key states markets where hillary clinton performed well and denver
7442999 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7443000 joe joe there is nothing we can do daddy will call when daddy calls and we cant make him do anything
7443001 so i havent been home in 14 days and tonight i get a bewildered call from my landlord saying i better get to the apartment the downstairs neighbors roof flooded
7443002 it looked like a festival porta potty in there vomit splattered all over at least i hope it was vomit otherwise that would be some fucked up shit coming out of your ass and my books are totally fucked and my paintings were all missing from the walls and there was spray painted graffiti there instead
7443003 every light was on in the entire apartment and there were crack pipes just lying around and rollings papers and a bunch of bikes and laptops probably 20 laptops and 10 bikes they were all stolen
7443004 i mean he had a problem with adderal but that stopped once he stopped gambling never crack i know a crack pipe when i see one
7443005 i mean who the fuck is this guy you live with is this guy your friend
7443006 all i know is that everything is totally fucked this is totally fucked
7443007 four years ago i moved in with a guy who smoked cocaine all day and at night he moved his furniture around he played the same elliot smith song his guitar over and over and moved his furniture over and over and picked at his face because he thought there were bugs under his skin and he cried and now your roommate thinks its a fantastic idea to turn on every light in your apartment along with every faucet and flood it while smoking crack how does this happen how do we meet these people
7443008 you know i have to write a story about this
7443009 i know actually the only time i ever saw chuck pahluniak speak he said in order to be a writer and have something to write about the only good advice he could give is choose your friends poorly
7443010 if they dnt let me fly to u ill arrrr
7443011 should i say i must fly there cos my girlfriends pregnant
7443012 sometimes he tried too hard to make sense of the world to figure out why people were bad to each other so often
7443013 he was something else although precisely what is hard to say a pilgrim perhaps
7443014 mom and dad put in incredibly long hours when we woke up in the morning to go to school theyd be in the office working when we came home in the afternoon theyd be in the office working when we went to bed at night theyd be in the office working they ran a real good business together and eventually started making bunches of money but they worked all the time
7443015 hed tell us to think about all the evil in the world all the hatred and imagine ourselves running against the forces of darkness the evil wall that was trying to keep us from running our best he believed doing well was all mental a simple matter of harnessing whatever energy was available as impressionable high school kids we were blown away by the kind of talk
7443016 and i suspect we had a similar intensity a similar heedlessness a similar agitation of the soul
7443017 we should all prepare for ramadan instead of engaging in immoral practices and violating the law
7443018 so if he wants to feel like hes on top of the world let him because he really is on top of the world

7443030 well see thats a fair question i just dont know the answer
7443031 i think hes moving pretty quickly up the learning curve
7443032 you saw it from the first quarter to the fourth quarter so hes making a lot of progress
7443033 we knew it was a process and you had a hope that it could get answered saturday with troy but he didnt have an opportunity to prove that so were still looking to make that decision as we go
7443034 we got to see how kyle is doing and we got to see how troy is doing thats something that we wouldnt want to make right now
7443035 i thought he made some good plays he had a chance to make a couple of big plays i think when he looks at it on tape hes going to feel like if i just put the ball on the money we got a chance to win the game big plays are the difference in this league and those are throws that he can make
7443036 im going to prepare myself to be ready at any time
7443037 the next time i get the opportunity im going to make the best of it
7443038 i guess your dad doesnt give the first impression of a clark gable but i and mom was a goood looker was lucky to win him from all the others who vied for his attention he was sooo charming he treated everyone as though they were his equal and he wanted them to know he respected them he was polite and courtly and attentive when others were being cocky and attempting to impress and he still is and thats more important than all of the things youve mentioned all of them put together
7443039 apabila kalian berjual beli dengan cara inah jual beli dengan cara riba memegang ekor ekor sapi peternakan ridha dengan bercocok tanam pertanian dan kalian meninggalkan jihad maka allah akan dicabut sampai kalian mau kembali kepada agama kalian
7443040 pada hari ini telah kusempurnakan untuk kamu agamamu dan telah kucukupkan kepadamu nikmat ku dan telah kuridhai islam itu jadi agama bagimu
7443041 hai orang orang yang beriman masuklah kamu ke dalam islam secara kaffah dan janganhlah kamu turut langkah langkah setan sesungguhnya setan itu musuh yang nyata bagimu
7443042 islam adalah engkau bersaksi bahwa tiada tuhan selain allah dan bahwa muhammad adalah rasulullah dan engkau dirikan sholat dan engkau tunaikan zakat dan engkau puasa ramadhan dan engkau berhaji ke baitullah jika engkau mampu menempuhnya
7443043 puncak persoalan adalah islam barangsiapa pasrah diri masuk islam maka dia selamat tiangnya islam adalah shalat dan atapnya adalah jihad yang dapat mencapainya hanya orang yang paling utama di antara mereka
7443044 perangilah di jalan allah orang orang yang memerangi kalian tetapi janganlah kalian melampaui batas karena sesungguhnya allah tidak menyukai orang orang yang melampaui batas
7443045 perangilah oleh kalian mereka orang orang kafir hingga tidak ada lagi fitnah kekufuran dan agama ini islam hanya milik allah
7443046 setiap jerih payah istri di rumah sama nilainya dengan jerih payah suami di medan jihad

7443048 we dont care who is out there we have to play like ravens we need to play faster and more physical we let them stay on the field forever in the first half thats not acceptable in the preseason not acceptable ever
7443049 it was subpar it wasnt a performance that we are used to on the ravens side of the ball
7443050 genuinely publicly devoted to a product or service even if they dont quite embody the values that the brands managers may be trying to convey
7443051 but it certainly could have a very subliminal effect it could degrade the brand

7443063 they fired rockets and entered the house after breaking the main gate they killed our five or six guards and then my elder brother and two nephews
7443064 by choosing to use fake ids students make ethical compromises that erode respect for the law
7443065 i remember college campuses when we had 18 year old drinking ages and i honestly believe weve made some progress
7443066 to just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all
7443067 see a problem of drinking on college campuses and they dont want to deal with it
7443068 i understand why colleges are doing it because it splits their students and they like to treat them all alike rather than having to card some of them its a nuisance to them
7443069 i wish these college presidents sat around and tried to work out ways to deal with the problem on their campus rather than try to eliminate the problem by defining it out of existence
7443070 this is to teddy this is what he has accomplished
7443071 he has done so much in his life and overcome a great deal he really is one of the best senators this country has ever had the best
7443072 the tribute to ted kennedy is not only going to be emotional but it is also going to be political in its motivations
7443073 the idea is of course to stir memories of prior democratic champions and to link obama with them
7443074 i think obama is an amazing candidate and i think he will be an excellent president and i am very excited about working with him for him
7443075 told through a combination of original interviews archival footage and still photographs that chronicle his enormous contributions to this country
7443076 so i think for all our family this is incredibly emotional
7443077 even republicans are going to have to say give him his due hes been there for a long time
7443078 if hes up to it in the 11th hour and can get the green light from doctors he might be able to pull it off

7443090 working at bare mimimums stretched as far as it can stretch
7443091 other unions have far more people getting around to 500 offices impossible task
7443092 our folks in need of a raise that hasnt happened for years
7443093 not even in the ballgame when it comes to videogames but were going to change that if its going to seattle or europe were doing something wrong answer to our work loss is to first do everything possible to protect provisions we already have that compensate our musicians so well but must have a creative dialog with musicians who arent working look to musicians who are doing well now to lift up those who arent working otherwise well create pools of non union musicians who will do the work for less money and fewer protections
7443094 within 3 months well have generated wages of over 500k opposed to 1m over a few years under
7443095 musicians today have different business model than in the past
7443096 whats their business model and what can we do to enhance their business
7443097 obviously something too important at this convention to follow the bylaws
7443098 did we vote to abandon democracy did i miss the vote we have bylaws for a reason every local in this room has paid its dues four locals have not paid and been told not to attend only one was told to come its shifty and patently manipulative a nakedly cynical attempt to subvert our bylaws and the convention nothing against my canadian colleagues and particularly my montreal colleagues but its a low trick that they were told to come from money they apparently dont have
7443099 this convention afirms that lcal 406 has not satisfied requirements to be represented at convention and 406 reps may not be seated as delegates but because they are present at the direct order of the president orders that afm reimburses travel and room expenses for 406 delegates and further that luc fortin be allowed to serve on law committee as an appointee of the president
7443100 cant be dealt with by a bunch of words in a rule book
7443101 had not thought that theres be anybody whod object to them being seated
7443102 my remarks about a german accent were not directed at eddie bayens he speaks with a dutch accent and the germans would have been shooting at him too

7443104 which will spare you the terrible task of my reading it to you after the break
7443105 i am convinced that honoring senator clintons historic campaign in this way will help us celebrate this defining moment in our history and bring the party together in a strong united fashion
7443106 with every voice heard and the party strongly united we will elect senator obama president of the united states and put our nation on the path to peace and prosperity once again
7443107 wir machen das magazin nicht weil gr n cool ist
7443108 everyone will think different if you make money off them if you plant them in rows theyre a cash crop
7443109 we always got a great reaction because they taste good
7443110 to think of things as weeds is kind of one dimensional
7443111 raymond is very well respected hes a forward thinking guy
7443112 raymond is a very good example of what it will take for our small family farms to thrive
7443113 we have to work toward farmers being able to get a reasonable return on their investments thats been a real challenge the last few years
7443114 theres no easy answers i think we have to look at getting a greater percentage of the food dollar
7443115 he didnt know anything about anne of green gables but he asked his secretary and she knew
7443116 he said the women do the buying so i think well be okay
7443117 mr loo said the farmer put in the first seeds last year three rows totalling about 550 metres hell be harvesting that first crop this week and is expecting a visit from his japanese partners around labour day
7443118 saakashvili should be tried for the stupidity that he has committed here

7443123 it will be a difficult autumn and it will be a difficult winter
7443124 i would like to congratulate our team on their remarkable speed in expanding wafer production capacity and their success in reaching the 1 0 gw milestone ahead of schedule

7443333 door het huidige slankheidideaal kun je je als stevige vrouw onprettig voelen in je ronde lichaam de maatschappelijke houding kan dit gevoel behoorlijk versterken controle discipline afslanken en gezondheid lijken d sleutelwoorden van dit moment deze woorden kunnen zwaar wegen omdat de omgeving je wellicht het gevoel geeft dat juist deze woorden niet in jouw vocabulaire voorkomen en wanneer je het gevoel hebt minder gewaardeerd te worden kan dat je verhinderen te zijn wie je werkelijk bent veel vrouwen projecteren negatieve gedachten op het lichaam met alle gevolgen van dien minder genieten van jezelf en daarmee van het leven jammer want elk lichaam verdient respect en liefdevolle aandacht wij hebben de rubenskaarten gemaakt om deze negatieve gedachten om te zetten in een liefdevolle kijk op jezelf passende inzichten zullen je inspireren en je helpen bij je ontwikkeling tot een zelfbewuste vrouw met een gezonde levenshouding
7443334 ik ben 1 van de 3 di tisten die verbonden zijn aan het obesitas programma van het wza ik ben sinds 2002 werkzaam in het wza en heb me vanaf het allereerste begin in september 2002 bezig gehouden met de obesitas poli eerst was dat een programma zonder maaltijdvervangers en vanaf sept 2004 werken we met modifast
7443335 ik zou het heel fijn vinden om vooraf te weten waar de interesse van de zaal ligt in principe zal ik vertellen wat afvallen met maaltijdvervangers betekent en waarom het werkt maar als er andere onderwerpen zijn dan hoor ik dat graag
7443336 weet jij welke zorgverzekering wel en welke n et de behandeling vergoedt
7443337 hallo regina vanuit ons team wil ik je vragen of er van jullie kant nog aandachtspunten zijn waarmee we rekening moeten houden om een obesitasbehandeling zo optimaal mogelijk te maken
7443338 je betaalt voor twee stoelen of je blijft maar thuis
7443339 beste regina ik ben op zoek naar mensen die hun ervaringen willen gebruiken om dit op een creatieve wijze te verwoorden
7443340 de deadline is 19 april het onderwerp is binnenkant versus buitenkant zowel als je dik bent of dik bent geweest eigenlijk waar wij het over hadden tijdens de avond waarom hangen we onze eigenwaarde allemaal op aan onze omvang en uiterlijk wat doe je om jezelf zo goed mogelijk te voelen is het daarvoor perse nodig om af te vallen en als je af wilt vallen wat voor uitgangspunt moet je daarvoor nemen een gevoel van minderwaardigheid of een gevoel van van jezelf houden let wel in principe is de gastredactie vrij om een eigen onderwerp te pakken maar de link naar binnenkant buitenkant is wel fijn omdat het thema van d ik vi daar over gaat de gastredactie krijgt 6 paginas van in totaal maximaal 2400 woorden om je een idee te geven deze informail bestaat al uit 1707 woorden het mag in n artikel maar het is aan te raden om minimaal 2 of zelfs 3 artikelen te maken het aantal woorden blijft maximaal gelijk de gastredactie mag ook bedenken wat voor beeld fotos ze bij de tekst wil hebben moeten er persoonlijke fotos bij of willen ze meer hun artikel visueel kracht bij zetten met prachtige plaatjes ik heb qua fotos nog een idee maar dat is heel erg controversieel ik zoek nl nog mensen die bloot op de foto willen met hun beste vriend vriendin of hun vrouw ouders of wat dan ook het gaat er dan om dat mensen vertellen over hun eigen lichaam maar ook over dat van de ander ik heb al twee vriendinnen die willen heel mooi ze gaan zitten alsof ze gewoon samen praten met een sigaretje maar dan toevallig bloot je kent nu een beetje de d ik stijl het wordt heel bijzonder en indrukwekkend dit staat trouwens los van de gastredactie maar als je mensen kent die aan deze reportage mee willen werken dan hoor ik het graag
7443341 er zijn arrangementen met gebakjes gefrituurde hapjes of alcohol maar dat zijn allemaal dingen die wij niet mogen hebben we zijn druk bezig met afvallen en willen alleen een zaal
7443342 dit is hoe wij werken bij elke zaal hoort een bepaalde omzet wij zitten in de fortuinlijke positie dat wij het druk hebben als deze club niet komt dan komt er wel een andere groep
7443343 voor dit soort bijeenkomsten hebben wij een vergaderarrangement voor 9 75 euro per persoon daarin zit onbeperkt gebruik van koffie thee fris minirepen en pepermunt als deze club dat liever niet heeft dan zetten we het zoetwaar gewoon niet in de zaal of de prijs dan omlaag gaat nee hooguit met een kwartje
7443344 ja dat is het belangrijkst wij hebben een maatjes lijst waarmee je iemand kunt zoeken om bijvoorbeeld mee te sporten of gewoon mee te praten als je veel afvalt kom je in een soort identiteitscrisis je gaat er ook letterlijk heel anders uitzien en je wordt opeens serieus genomen door mensen die je voorheen helem l niet serieus namen herkenning is dan zo fijn dat je merkt dat iedereen precies hetzelfde meemaakt
7443345 dat klopt maar dat is iets heel anders er zijn wel meer clubs voor dikke mensen in zijn algemeenheid bij ons gaat het echt om het afslankprogramma van het ziekenhuis wie dat wil kan natuurlijk ook lid worden van de obesitas vereniging
7443346 de bijeenkomst was in de lounge die leek ons wel gezellig met al die zitjes het was er alleen smoordruk het wereldkampioenschap atletiek voor gehandicapten was net aan de gang de lounge is dus geen optie voor een volgende keer huren we een zaal voor dertig personen dan zijn we minimaal tweehonderd euro kwijt daar bovenop komt een verplicht arrangement met drinken en lekkers
7443347 klopt haha je moet een arrangement boeken waar zoetwaar bij in zit dat is juist voor ons niet echt handig natuurlijk ik heb gesmeekt of we alsjeblieft alleen een zaal konden huren maar het personeel was niet onder de indruk dit is een zakelijke transactie en wij behandelen u net als alle anderen was het antwoord gelukkig kunnen we voor de volgende bijeenkomst terecht in het wilhelmina ziekenhuis
7443348 nee hoor iedereen die ge nteresseerd is is welkom ook mensen die twijfelen of ze het programma van het ziekenhuis zullen volgen of niet
7443349 aldus is mijn uitspraak en daar zul je het mee moeten doen
7443350 het enige waar ik spijt van heb is dat ik het niet 10 jaar eerder heb gedaan
7443351 je ziet er toch altijd leuk uit en je komt helemaal niet over alsof je er mee zit joh gewoon niet meer aan eten denken dan val je vanzelf af
7443352 de meeste mensen met zogeheten morbide obesitas nare naam maar zo heet deze officieel erkende ziekte nu eenmaal kunnen door een verstoorde stofwisseling niet meer op eigen houtje blijvend afvallen
7443353 als je een gecompliceerde beenbreuk hebt loop je er ook niet mee door dan vindt iedereen het normaal dat je geopereerd wordt in jouw geval is de ziekte zelf niet zichtbaar alleen de gevolgen daarvan en vinden mensen dat je het zelf maar moet oplossen dat is volledig onterecht
7443354 ik ben nog altijd te dik maar ik voel mij nu heel anders dan 5 jaar geleden
7443355 wat betreft de cursus er is inmiddels een nieuw draaiboek gemaakt het worden in totaal 6 bijeenkomsten waarbij het voedingstechnische aspect vooral op papier wordt aangeleverd en de bijeenkomsten met name sociaal emotionele aspecten bevatten e n bijeenkomst bestaat uit het bezoek aan de supermarkt ik heb nog geen contact gehad na mijn vakantie met de di tisten van het wza maar wat mij betreft gaan we binnenkort van start goed dat je me mailde ik zal er binnenkort mee aan de slag je hoort van me ik zal proberen zo snel mogelijk met een concreet voorstel te komen het lijkt mij dat we gewoon moeten gaan starten met de werving en kijken wie er mee wil doen bij voldoende aanmeldingen gaan we gewoon starten is mijn idee
7443356 ik ben eigenares en ontwerpster van het kledingmerk exelle in enschede zie www exelle com er zijn in nederland weinig ontwerpers die gespecialiseerd zijn in grote maten kleding de meeste grote maten mode komt uit het buitenland dus je bent bij mij aan het goede adres ik heb het momenteel druk maar ik vind het ook hartstikke goed dat jullie dit organiseren en dan is het belangrijk dat je steeds nieuwe en interessante avonden hebt bovendien zit ook ik in het oosten van het land dus wil ik wel over het maken van grote maten kleding komen vertellen

7443446 in unserer macho gesellschaft gilt es als schande f r den vater wenn sein sohn zu weiblich heranw chst
7443447 es kommt vor dass leute ihren job verlieren weil sie schwul sind und viele psychologen versuchen homosexuelle zu heilen
7443448 aber sie verlangt dass ich mich unauff llig verhalte um vor den nachbarn den schein zu wahren
7443449 erst war das parlament 18 monate lang geschlossen dann hatten wir zwei monate lang keine regierung wie sollen wir uns unter diesen bedingungen daf r einsetzen dass das gesetz gegen homosexualit t abgeschafft wird
7443450 hier trifft man alle m glichen leute christen schiiten sunniten normalerweise bleiben die konfessionen unter sich hier feiern alle zusammen
7443451 zudem kommen jede menge golf araber auf der suche nach homosexuellem sex
7443452 der samstagabend ist der einzige moment an dem ich ich selbst sein kann
7443453 da drau en kann ich niemandem sagen dass ich schwul bin nicht einmal meinen freunden
7443454 ich habe zuerst mit helem zusammengearbeitet dann aber wurde mir klar dass die sache der lesben viel mehr mit frauen als mit schwulenrechten zu tun hat
7443455 hier hat eine frau nicht einmal das recht ber ihre eigene sexualit t zu bestimmen unter diesen bedingungen ist es unm glich sich f r die anerkennung von lesben einzusetzen
7443456 die glauben sie seien die einzigen auf der welt denen es so geht

7443460 als hunderttausende in beirut auf die stra e gingen und freiheit und demokratie forderten haben wir homosexuellen gedacht das land wacht auf

7443508 the abcc is the last vestiges of howards unfair ir laws
7443509 no other workers in this country apart from workers in the construction industry are faced with this sort of heavy handed and undemocratic assault on their human rights
7443510 im stuck with a car worth 18 000 i havent been able to pay it off
7443511 my wifes health has deteriorated my healths deteriorated because of the stress that was placed on both of us
7443512 they are industries in which there have been problems with industrial compliance and we therefore believe that they require specialist attention
7443513 vorrei ha detto il candidato democratico che alla fine la gente dicesse
7443514 non sono sguardi per me si schernisce ma per lucia morico la mia compagna di stanza
7443515 a londr sar un po in l con gli anni
7443516 he is my refuge and my fortress my god in whom i trust
7443517 i will rescue him i will protect him for he acknowledges my name he will call upon me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble i will deliver him and honor him with long life will i satisfy him and show him my salvation
7443518 i think women have big big hang ups about exposing any part of their body
7443519 i wish i could take their hands and say its okay
7443520 im very lucky to have in my past a woman who put on one of these newfangled bathing suits at the turn of the century
7443521 it appears that our community is accepting of the naked bike ride
7443522 trying to measure that community tolerance is very hard prince george for example has much more conservative traditions than vancouver i dont know if there are any traditions in vancouver
7443523 if we could poll 1 000 people across the lower mainland we would find a smattering who would say yup im all for naturists rights but i think youd still find a considerable number of people who would say no id not be comfortable with that
7443524 i recognize their right to go do that be naked but i dont want their rights to interfere with my rights not to be offended not to have my children see that and so thats where we run into conflict
7443525 you cant look at car commercials or a beer commercial and many other things that are advertised without a scantily clad man or woman
7443526 when we dont have any modesty left we characterize sex and sexuality as being just a crass thing without talking about intimacy or love or the very nature of what intimacy is intended to be so when we lose modesty we lose a lot of the other things that go with it
7443527 the city of surrey has a long history of opposing any form of nude recreation
7443528 surrey anything to do with nude recreation they just stonewall put up their defences
7443529 when youre doing any kind of protest you can raise your voice and have signs and everything but to get exposure you have to rattle people
7443530 and well unfortunately in this society right now nothing rattles people more than seeing a lot of people nude
7443531 most recreations for adults are like golf work hard try hard
7443532 theres no silliness i think its time that the world was more silly and nudity is one of the ways you can be silly the people having fun are not the ones to worry about the people you have to worry about are the people who are really serious and feel threatened when people are frightened theyre not playful when people are laughing and having fun they dont do harm to others the world needs more play the world needs more laughter and fun
7443533 a bit of a social movement a panacea to the early urban industrial social pathologies that were cropping up all over the place a way to get the working and middle classes to connect with nature not in an ecological sense but in generating some solidarity in the face of some of the problems that urban living was creating
7443534 it seems that nudity is not the main attraction its the social aspect of getting together sunbathing skinny dipping
7443535 theres so many mores if women cover their childs eyes i think thats kind of sad why not take the opportunity to explain to your kids those are breasts and just like that guy over there shes got her top off have a discussion about body parts
7443536 like im not going to go to an opera house top free im a clothing optionalist we believe that everyone has the right to wear as much or as little clothing as they want without being thrown in jail

7443544 my hope is that we can look back in 10 years time and say look we actually turned it around
7443545 we actually have a sustainable well managed river system in australia
7443546 weve gone from what was a real problem a system over allocated to hell to something that is sustainable that provides food and fibre for australia that provides water for adelaide and other communities and is a healthy functioning river
7443547 thats my hope and thats what i reckon weve got to start to do
7443548 we actually dont know to what extent were seeing permanent climate change
7443549 for a number of the catchments were tracking below the worst case scenario for 2050
7443550 if thats not just an anomaly which we all hope it is if thats an indication of permanent change thats a very substantial shift and something thats really very difficult for us to address in the short term
7443551 what weve got to do now is not wait for that to be identified by the experts weve just got to purchase water and return it to the river
7443552 these are australians working the land who do i think need to have the ability to either trade out or to reconfigure what they do
7443553 youve got to give them a bit of time to do that
7443554 the heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure who can understand it

7443571 the hardest thing was probably waking up every day and knowing that you put in the hardest day of your life the day before and youve got to do the same thing again for and for the next 100 days
7443572 because there was only two of us out there we needed each other to survive there was no walking away from each other
7443573 after so many things started to go wrong and we overcame all these different little obstacles it started to get personal
7443574 we really wanted to get to the far side of this island and not let it beat us because it was trying so hard to stop us getting there
7443575 but when youre out there it is just such an amazing feeling you feel that much more alive
7443576 it is amazing when you have a wolf walk right up to you or a polar bear

7443622 majority of child sex workers were trafficked from different parts of the country they are normally promised so many things but unfortunately they are later turned into sex slaves
7443623 most of the venues belong to the women whom we call sengas aunts they operate small bars and some of them have turned part of their residential houses into lodges
7443624 our clients usually pay for the lodges and we pay the sengas who manage the places where we normally stage ourselves
7443625 if they sengas get male clients at their bars who have some money they ring us to come and make money and give them a commission
7443626 the commission shall not later than 30th september in each year submit to the national assembly a report of its activities during the immediately preceding year and shall include in such report the audited accounts of the commission
7443627 the report was submitted because i spoke with mallam nuhu ribadu on it this year the report will be submitted because it is one of the things i will be discussing with the chairman it is in the law regulating the efcc there is supposed to be an annual report submitted to the national assembly on the 30th of september each year
7443628 i dont remember receiving the report i am in washington now i have put all those things behind me and i have moved on to other things i am not sure but call those people that are there they have a way of checking it it is an institution
7443629 we have checked and the thing is not here and if it had come it would have been recorded and passed on to senator akinyede

7443635 that mr thedeaus ochoma teddy at the governors lodge later told me and i verily believe him that the governor and the chief of staff are busy and therefore had directed him to continue the transaction in the governors sitting room
7443636 i paid the sum of n10 000 000 for the grains to mr thedeaus ochoma teddy who gave me a receipt for the payment

7443674 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7443675 they said they would be there in a minute and i said you better make that a quick minute because there is woman standing here going up in flames
7443676 but by the time i got back around to her place i couldnt get in to get her out the unit was engulfed it happened that fast
7443677 the flames started near the bed and she might have spread it with her burning clothes
7443678 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7443679 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7443680 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7443681 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7443682 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7443683 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7443684 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7443685 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7443686 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7443687 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7443688 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7443689 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7443690 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7443691 the hardest thing was probably waking up every day and knowing that you put in the hardest day of your life the day before and youve got to do the same thing again for and for the next 100 days
7443692 because there was only two of us out there we needed each other to survive there was no walking away from each other
7443693 after so many things started to go wrong and we overcame all these different little obstacles it started to get personal
7443694 we really wanted to get to the far side of this island and not let it beat us because it was trying so hard to stop us getting there
7443695 but when youre out there it is just such an amazing feeling you feel that much more alive
7443696 it is amazing when you have a wolf walk right up to you or a polar bear
7443697 its not the finish i had imagined but i am slowly coming to terms with whats happened over the last 24 hours
7443698 i feel were probably one of the teams and i think theyre all about the same really between fourth and twelfth we could have finished anywhere up to fourth
7443699 were going to finish tenth or eleventh so therefore thats a failure
7443700 weve failed to end up where i think were capable of doing
7443701 we had seven games that have been decided by less than two goals and we lost three and won four
7443702 theyre the ones you tend to think if youre in front with a few minutes to go thats where you feel like you should be able to now protect the lead for a few minutes
7443703 one of the things that you always do at the end of the season and players should as well is ask how many players had career best years or how many players played as well as they have before
7443704 over the whole season there would be more that would look back and say no i didnt have a great year
7443705 some might say i had a poor year some might say i had an okay year but there would only be a handful that probably have felt yeah this is my best year that ive had in my footy career
7443706 i feel like weve got more upside in our players than weve got logical downsides so i still think were on the up
7443707 at the time the impact of the campaign was closely monitored and it was estimated that about 190 000 australians quit smoking
7443708 very few health programs save more than they cost but the ntc did
7443709 when this campaign was launched 10 years ago it was the first time that smokers really saw real life situations of what happened to their bodies as a result of their habit
7443710 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces
7443711 it is not easy release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7443712 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7443713 yeah ive not been as good as last year that would be true the time spent in football and worrying about football has probably increased 10 20 per cent but the output and the results have certainly decreased probably 50 per cent or whatever it is
7443714 so its not necessarily the harder you work the better results you get in coaching it depends on a lot of factors but there have been some positives
7443715 weve worked really well as a coaching group theres been a real united feel about the group which is fantastic for us
7443716 theres opportunities for people to be divisive and have their own agendas and maybe listen to outside influences but thats been good and the ability to be able to help develop our new coaching group and also our younger players thats been good
7443717 coachings a little bit of you put some time in and it all blossoms some time in the future
7443718 we played geelong first up and we lost by 120 points the first time the grand final and lost by only about 10 the second so you think gee theyre probably into it for the year
7443719 my analysis would be those early games and maybe it was that game certainly then we lost the second game easily we came back the crows game we were a chance to win and maybe even the next game
7443720 there were some close calls where we didnt quite get over the line and when you add that up to the disappointment at the end maybe then it started to kick in
7443721 the abcc is the last vestiges of howards unfair ir laws
7443722 no other workers in this country apart from workers in the construction industry are faced with this sort of heavy handed and undemocratic assault on their human rights
7443723 im stuck with a car worth 18 000 i havent been able to pay it off
7443724 my wifes health has deteriorated my healths deteriorated because of the stress that was placed on both of us
7443725 they are industries in which there have been problems with industrial compliance and we therefore believe that they require specialist attention
7443726 its very helpful to have a contraceptive options that has been shown to ease some of the intense physical and emotional symptoms associated with this condition
7443727 this 24 4 regimen combined with the low dose of hormones can improve the severe physical and emotional ups and downs some women experience with pmdd
7443728 the democrats in charge of this congress have been heavy on fluff and light on substance
7443729 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7443730 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7443731 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7443732 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7443733 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7443734 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7443735 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7443736 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7443737 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7443738 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7443739 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7443740 western australia urgently requires alternative gas resources which can provide a diversity of supply so that we dont again experience the power problems of recent months
7443741 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7443742 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7443743 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7443744 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7443745 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7443746 is that i wish a woman would have been on the ticket but alas america is not ready to embrace and support having a woman on the ticket top or otherwise
7443747 this is a guy who can out straight talk the straight talk express
7443748 you might not always like what joe says but hes going to give it to you straight
7443749 but in terms of their approach to things they are very similar i was a big supporter of chet in regard to that process we all knew it was a long shot
7443750 i still believe that hillary clinton would have been a better choice for obama
7443751 selecting senator clinton would have unified my party in ways that no other pick could reigniting the enthusiasm of 18 million hillary supporters
7443752 id be happy but the convention hasnt started yet so we need to follow procedure
7443753 i dont think barack would do it or hillary would accept
7443754 it would have been smart of him to name her as his sidekick because she got half the vote
7443755 there are going to be a significant number of people who are going to hold a grudge
7443756 im disappointed as it apparently seems that in the race for the white house its a mans world after all
7443757 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7443758 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7443759 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7443760 there comes a time when youve got to go to the barricades and let it rip both gore and kerry were eviscerated on personal grounds by their opponents campaigns
7443761 it is really important that obama responds to the charge that he is elitist democrats dont want the criticisms to take hold and affect public opinion
7443762 i sometimes struggle just to get the essentials you know the milk the bread the eggs
7443763 how can john mccain fix the economy when he doesnt think its broken
7443764 just because the other side is fighting dirty it doesnt mean we have to stoop to their level
7443765 if we are going to win this election then we have to live up to our promise that we represent a new kind of politics
7443766 these attacks can be unpleasant and a cause of anxiety but this exchange is important its very informative for voters the american public needs to know not only if obama can take a punch but if he can throw one the image of obama is that he is cerebral he needs to show that he has a gut instinct and that he can be a street fighter
7443767 heres one house american cant afford to let john mccain move into
7443768 does a guy who worries about the price of arugula and thinks regular people cling to guns and religion in the face of economic hardship really want to have a debate about whos in touch with regular americans
7443769 the boston tea party supports reducing the size scope and power of government at all levels and on all issues
7443770 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7443771 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7443772 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7443773 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7443774 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7443775 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7443776 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7443777 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7443778 the federation council is ready to recognize abkhazias and south ossetias independence if the people of these regions wish and if there is an appropriate decision by the russian president
7443779 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego
7443780 we got mouths to feed though gotta stay true to who you are and where you came from cause at the top will be the same place you hang from
7443781 they gotta put your face on a 5 000 bill
7443782 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish and arrogant and individuals
7443783 but what you saw today was a team bonding and facing adversity and coming out with a big win
7443784 he likes to have the ball down the stretch and take care of those big plays down the stretch im familiar with that
7443785 kobe hes a special player hes the best player on the planet right now
7443786 kobe loves that situation if he has the ball and we need a basket we know we can count on him
7443787 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7443788 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7443789 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7443790 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7443791 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7443792 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7443793 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7443794 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7443795 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7443796 its not the finish i had imagined but i am slowly coming to terms with whats happened over the last 24 hours
7443797 the realisation that i had just played my last game for the knights was very overwhelming and the thought of not putting on my red and blue no 9 jersey ever again was really hard to comprehend
7443798 western australia urgently requires alternative gas resources which can provide a diversity of supply so that we dont again experience the power problems of recent months
7443799 its very helpful to have a contraceptive options that has been shown to ease some of the intense physical and emotional symptoms associated with this condition
7443800 this 24 4 regimen combined with the low dose of hormones can improve the severe physical and emotional ups and downs some women experience with pmdd
7443801 at the time the impact of the campaign was closely monitored and it was estimated that about 190 000 australians quit smoking
7443802 very few health programs save more than they cost but the ntc did
7443803 when this campaign was launched 10 years ago it was the first time that smokers really saw real life situations of what happened to their bodies as a result of their habit
7443804 the hardest thing was probably waking up every day and knowing that you put in the hardest day of your life the day before and youve got to do the same thing again for and for the next 100 days
7443805 because there was only two of us out there we needed each other to survive there was no walking away from each other
7443806 after so many things started to go wrong and we overcame all these different little obstacles it started to get personal
7443807 we really wanted to get to the far side of this island and not let it beat us because it was trying so hard to stop us getting there
7443808 but when youre out there it is just such an amazing feeling you feel that much more alive
7443809 it is amazing when you have a wolf walk right up to you or a polar bear
7443810 i feel were probably one of the teams and i think theyre all about the same really between fourth and twelfth we could have finished anywhere up to fourth
7443811 were going to finish tenth or eleventh so therefore thats a failure
7443812 weve failed to end up where i think were capable of doing
7443813 we had seven games that have been decided by less than two goals and we lost three and won four
7443814 theyre the ones you tend to think if youre in front with a few minutes to go thats where you feel like you should be able to now protect the lead for a few minutes
7443815 one of the things that you always do at the end of the season and players should as well is ask how many players had career best years or how many players played as well as they have before
7443816 over the whole season there would be more that would look back and say no i didnt have a great year
7443817 some might say i had a poor year some might say i had an okay year but there would only be a handful that probably have felt yeah this is my best year that ive had in my footy career
7443818 i feel like weve got more upside in our players than weve got logical downsides so i still think were on the up
7443819 it was a bit of a where are we session more than anything
7443820 i am very excited and a little nervous because its the first time in several years that im going to be working for another company and not own the product
7443821 this is our latest acquisition and we feel it is a good one
7443822 jewel has been well respected in front of the camera and behind and we are looking forward to some great new additions to her line
7443823 i live in new york and i think theres a good talent pool here
7443824 i think the girls dont know who to go to so they go out to los angeles now that ive contacted them and they know its legit and not a scam ive been able to convince them and kind of re establish the new york scene
7443825 after a prime so harassed and hobbled williams was granted by the relenting fates a golden twilight
7443826 a reasonable sum of money for your peace of mind
7443827 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7443828 of course its possible to prepare a forecast with any lead time you like whether or nor that forecast has any accuracy or usable skill is another question
7443829 je ne suis pas venu pour les bien portant mais pour les malades et les infirmes
7443830 typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd from the comfort of moms basement
7443831 naturally gamers are not amused by the mccain campaigns quick resort to 80s era cultural stereotypes once mccain masters the internet were confident hell contemporize and start bashing video gamers instead
7443832 wields a fox cloak of deception with a 10 stun against nearby intelligent creatures
7443833 yeah ive not been as good as last year that would be true the time spent in football and worrying about football has probably increased 10 20 per cent but the output and the results have certainly decreased probably 50 per cent or whatever it is
7443834 so its not necessarily the harder you work the better results you get in coaching it depends on a lot of factors but there have been some positives
7443835 weve worked really well as a coaching group theres been a real united feel about the group which is fantastic for us
7443836 theres opportunities for people to be divisive and have their own agendas and maybe listen to outside influences but thats been good and the ability to be able to help develop our new coaching group and also our younger players thats been good
7443837 coachings a little bit of you put some time in and it all blossoms some time in the future
7443838 we played geelong first up and we lost by 120 points the first time the grand final and lost by only about 10 the second so you think gee theyre probably into it for the year
7443839 my analysis would be those early games and maybe it was that game certainly then we lost the second game easily we came back the crows game we were a chance to win and maybe even the next game
7443840 there were some close calls where we didnt quite get over the line and when you add that up to the disappointment at the end maybe then it started to kick in
7443841 they said they would be there in a minute and i said you better make that a quick minute because there is woman standing here going up in flames
7443842 but by the time i got back around to her place i couldnt get in to get her out the unit was engulfed it happened that fast
7443843 the flames started near the bed and she might have spread it with her burning clothes
7443844 the abcc is the last vestiges of howards unfair ir laws
7443845 no other workers in this country apart from workers in the construction industry are faced with this sort of heavy handed and undemocratic assault on their human rights
7443846 im stuck with a car worth 18 000 i havent been able to pay it off
7443847 my wifes health has deteriorated my healths deteriorated because of the stress that was placed on both of us
7443848 they are industries in which there have been problems with industrial compliance and we therefore believe that they require specialist attention
7443849 it is a gesture towards the palestinian leadership to strengthen moderate and pragmatic forces
7443850 it is not easy release prisoners and particularly those who have been involved in murderous terrorist attacks
7443851 releasing these kinds of prisoners indicates that the criteria israel used in the past will not endure this clears the way for other prisoners
7443852 may be too closely aligned with people who hold radical political views
7443853 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7443854 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7443855 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7443856 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7443857 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7443858 we believe that coal use will increase under any foreseeable scenario because it is cheap and abundant
7443859 should and will take actions to reduce the emissions of co2 and other greenhouse gas emissions
7443860 coal will continue to play a large and indispensable role in a greenhouse gas constrained world
7443861 an uncharacteristically wet cold july in anchorage and across the interior has devastated bee season
7443862 meteorologist roman berdes says an unusual cold air mass from canada will bring lower temperatures
7443863 people worried about the high cost of keeping warm this winter will draw little comfort from the farmers almanac which predicts below average temperatures for most of the u s
7443864 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7443865 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7443866 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7443867 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7443868 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7443869 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7443870 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7443871 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7443872 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7443873 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7443874 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7443875 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7443876 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7443877 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7443878 who will be the new vice president whoever you want thats who
7443879 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore
7443880 barack obama has a good lead with women and an even greater potential to increase that lead
7443881 where he has shown the most room to grow is among these senior women
7443882 is not living up to his full potential with white older unmarried women
7443883 this is an issue that really demonstrates youre in touch with womens lives
7443884 opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems
7443885 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7443886 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7443887 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7443888 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7443889 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7443890 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7443891 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7443892 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7443893 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7443894 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7443895 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7443896 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7443897 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7443898 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7443899 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7443900 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7443901 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7443902 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7443903 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7443904 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7443905 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7443906 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7443907 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7443908 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7443909 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7443910 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7443911 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7443912 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7443913 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7443914 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7443915 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7443916 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7443917 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7443918 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7443919 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7443920 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7443921 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7443922 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7443923 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7443924 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7443925 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7443926 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7443927 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7443928 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7443929 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7443930 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7443931 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7443932 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7443933 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7443934 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7443935 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7443936 has confirmed that he is going to give a fundraiser for sen obama
7443937 from now through election day i intend to do whatever i can to make sure he is elected president of the united states
7443938 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7443939 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7443940 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7443941 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7443942 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7443943 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7443944 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7443945 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7443946 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7443947 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7443948 an online incubator for progressive ideas that challenge the status quo
7443949 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7443950 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7443951 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7443952 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7443953 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7443954 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands

7443962 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7443963 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7443964 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7443965 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7443966 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side
7443967 during my service in the united states congress i took the initiative in creating the internet
7443968 i took the initiative in starting programs that ultimately led to the creation of the internet
7443969 you know how to make yoghurt but you dont know anything about football
7443970 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7443971 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7443972 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7443973 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7443974 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7443975 in the streets it is prohibited to spit and to speak breton
7443976 lyndon b johnson was initiated on october 30 1937 in johnson city lodge no 561 at johnson city texas but completed only the entered apprentice or first of the three masonic degrees for this reason he is not included in the gallery
7443977 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7443978 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells

7444019 the latest work to appear in the space of warsaw as part of the exhibition another city another life http ancity blogspot com is mona vatamanu and florin tudors installation dust grzybowska 51 the intervention is extremely modest just a small pile of earth by the side of a square hole filled with cement dust and is in a location which even if you know the address is not easy to find in a plot of wasteland behind a car repair workshop however the very modesty of the piece is crucial to its effect for the minimal scale and ambition of this dust filled square stands in wild contrast to the vigorous construction to be seen and heard in action all around you here in warsaws wola district this is all the more so since to one side of the square stands a characterful ruined old red brick building whose blocked windows mirror the shape of the cement dust square while on the plot of wasteland stand a couple of awkward poetic trees and can be heard amongst the clatter of building the song of birds and the bustle of car repairs leaving the cement on the surface of their square mona v t manu and florin tudor seem to be asking what is being buried under the eagerness to build in this part of warsaw for another layer which cannot go unnoticed in this area of the former ghetto is that the piled earth seems reminiscent of a grave here the tombstone is not vertical but lies horizontal in the soil it is not a solid univocal whole of stone organizing memory but the fragmented particularity of dust how many layers of city are buried in the act of building how many distinct particles are homogenized in a construction mona v t manu and florin tudor have been pursuing the traces of disappeared modernism especially in bucharest where they live and work in a consequent way in their art for some time and are conscientious observers of the changing space of cities around them their work here was modest and honest the very act of shoveling and the use of a spade in this wasteland zone of the former jewish section of the city constitute more than just physical work with a tool but their action was also not simply symbolic it was also work like the many other acts of digging and reconstruction being performed by workmen all over warsaw did mona or florin do the toughest part of the digging for them dust is political and their action was open would the rain turn the dust into cement sealing some part of the wound in the surface of the earth of the city underneath it this physical opening of the surface of the city in a minor location becomes a place from which to contemplate the drama of warsaws various temporal rhythms in a new way

7444071 i apologize for not knowing the total medal count of china but i know you have won a lot of gold
7444072 new stars were born stars from past games amazed us again we shared their joys and their tears and we marveled at their ability we will long remember the achievements we witnessed here

7444084 these exercises in ambient foresight and anticipatory democracy are intended to engage the public in creative thinking about possible and preferable futures
7444085 prolific experimentation with formats for sharing our forecasts and processes for engaging groups in discussion of their implications

7444091 since vitamin d is produced in the skin through solar or uv irradiation and high serum levels have been shown to correlate with a reduced risk of ms this suggests that vitamin d may regulate the immune response and may promote a hosts reaction to a pathogen
7444092 evidence has shown that the maintenance of an adequate vitamin d level may have a protective effect in individuals predisposed to ms
7444093 one device of vitamin d action may be to preserve balance in the t cell reaction and thus avoid autoimmunity
7444094 governments and employers have a duty of care for these workers the abuse and exploitation of people coming into this country to help relieve labour shortages must cease it is clear there is an urgent need for stronger regulation and monitoring of the conditions the 457 visa holders are being employed under

7444096 these rat model tumors were developed from human glioblastoma tumor cells and closely mimic human tumors in growth patterns and response to therapy
7444097 the concept of targeting blood vessels that feed tumors as an approach to limit tumor growth is not a novel idea
7444098 however blocking the specific fatty acid described in this study is novel and holds great promise for use in humans
7444099 if survival time could be extended with a combination of surgical therapy and infusion with similar drugs this could be a significant treatment option
7444100 these pumps have been used in humans for other diseases and can be designed for delivery of these drugs as well
7444101 we believe they can be used to deliver drugs to block angiogenesis in complex human tumors such as glioblastomas
7444102 the start of the clinical study for pmx 30063 represents a major milestone for polymedix and we believe for the entire medical community
7444103 this novel antibiotic compound signals a fundamental potential breakthrough in treating infectious diseases pmx 30063 is the first and only small molecule defensin mimetic to commence clinical development for the treatment of systemic infections and the first and only such compound whose mechanism of action is intended to directly address the major problem of bacterial drug resistance we are proud to be the first company to bring this completely new type of antibiotic to clinical trials and to address a major clinical need and market opportunity

7444136 christian leaders must therefore adapt to this emerging church those who fail to do so are blind to the cultural accretions that hide the gospel behind forms of thought and modes of expression that no longer communicate with the new generation
7444137 painfully reductionistic about modernism and the confessional christianity that forged its way through the modernist period
7444138 i generally dont even use the term movement at this point
7444139 i think its more of a conversation its a group of people who are talking about the gospel and church and mission especially in terms of changes going on in our culture that some people call a shift from modern to postmodern culture
7444140 those of us in the west now realize that there were a lot of bad consequences of european and american people trying to tell everybody else how things are
7444141 we feel that theres got to be a lot more humility and a lot more gentleness and that the gospel is made credible not by how we argue and make truth claims but its made credible by the love and the good deeds that flow from our lives and our community
7444142 embracing the worldview of the postmodern age he embraces relativism at the cost of clarity in matters of truth and intends to redefine christianity for this new age largely in terms of an eccentric mixture of elements he would take from virtually every theological position and variant
7444143 as a postmodernist he considers himself free from any concern for propositional truthfulness and simply wants the christian community to embrace a pluriform understanding of truth as a way out of doctrinal conflict and impasse
7444144 when it comes to issues such as the exclusivity of the gospel the identity of jesus christ as both fully human and fully divine the authoritative character of scripture as written revelation and the clear teaching of scripture concerning issues such as homosexuality this movement simply refuses to answer the questions
7444145 a responsible theological argument must acknowledge that difficult questions demand to be answered we are not faced with an endless array of doctrinal variants from which we can pick and choose
7444146 homosexuality either will or will not be embraced as normative the church either will or will not accept a radical revisioning of the missionary task we will either see those who have not come to faith in the lord jesus christ as persons to whom we should extend a clear gospel message and a call for decision or we will simply come alongside them to tell our story as they tell their own
7444147 dr albert mohler is one of the people who have talked about this
7444148 but yet there are many southern baptists who are doing this very thing many missionaries are realizing that the issue isnt whether a person identifies with a religion that now is seen as a western european religion but the important thing is to help people identify with jesus and become followers of jesus
7444149 i want to help people understand everything they can about the cross i wouldnt say that having that understanding jesus dying as a substitute for sinful humanity is all that it means to be a christian i think that some people might have that understanding and not be interested in following jesus they want jesus blood to pay for their sins so they can go to heaven but they arent really interested in following jesus in this life
7444150 i have my own opinions but i dont believe that the smartest thing for me to do is to go around and make those varying opinions a reason to separate myself from other christians
7444151 i fellowship with christians who have a diversity of opinion of this homosexuality
7444152 i respect dr mclaren greatly and have appreciated his insight on reaching people in todays culture
7444153 we try to bring dynamic speakers to the evangelism conference who will challenge and inspire their listeners i felt that in this instance however dr mclarens position diverges too greatly to be appropriate for this conference
7444154 unwilling to affirm that the bible contains propositional truths that form the framework for christian belief this movement argues that we can have christian symbolism and substance without those thorny questions of truthfulness that have so vexed the modern mind
7444155 the worldview of postmodernism complete with an epistemology that denies the possibility of or need for propositional truth affords the movement an opportunity to hop skip and jump throughout the bible and the history christian thought in order to take whatever pieces they want from one theology and attach them like doctrinal post it notes to whatever picture they would want to draw
7444156 he most likely maintained ancient jewish laws on the matter but condemning gays was not on his big ten hit list while attacking judgmental religious people was

7444164 let me be blunt what has unfolded in china the past two weeks is less a global sports festival than a corporate land rush into the worlds no 1 growth market in those terms the cha ching games of beijing have been a huge success
7444165 in terms of the vision of pierre de coubertin founder of the modern olympics beijing represents a total bastardization his credo was the important thing is not to win but take part the beijing games motto was do you take visa
7444166 ioc president jacques rogge and his cohorts repeatedly let the chinese play them for patsies in part the suits from lausanne switzerland ioc headquarters were victims of their own egos
7444167 we came to beijing and showed that were the best in the world at the game that was invented in america and im going to enjoy this

7444174 besides joe has been around for a long time hes a loose guy who will bring a little fun to the campaign look at his comments about his drop dead gorgeous wife during the announcement in springfield some might call that a gaffe but i call it being human heck his wife jill was reportedly getting a root canal at the dentist when he got the call hed been chosen ive always talked up joe hes a great guy
7444175 and i dont know if i can climb out of it
7444176 part of me is still very sad because i thought this was going to be our time even my 8 year old granddaughter sadie was devastated when hillary lost but i am especially pleased obama selected joe biden as his running mate he co authored the violence against women act
7444177 the president of colombia he didnt speak english and im not even sure he spoke spanish
7444178 every time reno said that you could hear toilets flushing and refrigerators opening across america taking breaks because they had obviously heard it all before
7444179 the federation council of the russian federation taking into account multiple appeals by south ossetia and abkhazia on recognising their independence including those received on august 22 and 24 2008 proposes to recognise the independence of south ossetia and abkhazia
7444180 when all the delegates met a few months ago me and my friends brought down the average age in the room by several decades at least
7444181 delegates tended to be the same folks year after year but this year its a lot different
7444182 say they are interested in following what happens at the democratic convention up from 36 percent in 2004
7444183 if we can get young people into our house early then you have them for life
7444184 and unlike 20 years ago when young people came home from the convention and told their families about what they did now they can connect online with their social networks of people who arent there and spread the word
7444185 i think many of us want to see first hand the fruit of what we all worked so hard for
7444186 its a good opportunity for many of these people to network with the political players who they wouldnt ordinarily have access to
7444187 not because of who they are as individuals but because of the collective power of the netroots
7444188 and theres free beer in the big tent all week
7444189 is the highest political achievement anyone in my family has done
7444190 i know it sounds cliche or whatever but i want to go there so i can help make sure that other people have the same chances i did
7444191 they were shooting the ball well today and when they get going like that they are tough to stop
7444192 you never want to get in a scoring battle with the hungarians because they are such great shooters we wanted to make it a defensive game but we just didnt get it done
7444193 its going to hurt tonight its going to hurt tomorrow and for a few days but as the weeks and months go by the players are going to realize what a huge accomplishment it is
7444194 nobody expected them to do anything here they had a great run and theyve got a lot to be proud of
7444195 you always got to believe you have a chance to win but when the seconds are ticking down and you realize were going to probably not win this game thats a slap in the face it stings
7444196 we were with them for awhile but they just kept coming and thats why they are three time gold medal champions
7444197 how can this man give us his flesh to eat
7444198 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7444199 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7444200 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognize the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted
7444201 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7444202 por venir mal indicados la fecha o el lugar que se les fija

7444207 go ahead and forgive feel free to forgive get all crazy with that forgiveness thing but dont go nuts listen
7444208 you forgive for you you forgive those who have snubbed you wronged you abused you and dissed you not because your perpetrator deserves it not even because theyve asked for it but because you need it its wrong to hold on to your anger
7444209 its unhealthy clinging to your sense of outrage will only hold you back it will only keep you in bondage set yourself free go ahead forgive the perpetrator doesnt even need to know she doesnt even count you are all that matters you and your feelings you and your perceptions you and your need to get on with your life so go ahead forgive and then move on
7444210 hes had a major setback so i suppose his critical condition is super critical at the moment
7444211 the doctors are very concerned about which way to go what course of action to take and theyre conferring about the whole thing now

7444215 i missed four of those cuts by bogeying the last hole but yeah its definitely vindicating ive been doing a lot of work on putts inside four feet and staying mentally sharp
7444216 at that point i switched gloves switched my ball and told my caddie lets finish lets do this
7444217 i was playing on sheer confidence all week and its unfortunate i didnt get the win but second place is my second best finish on tour
7444218 nothing we can do about it now but move on
7444219 i had the lead twice and i gave it back both times leaving two balls over the plate a game like today the importance of the game you cant allow that to happen

7444271 blogs are just new ways to get your message out to the people
7444272 we have received neither reply nor acknowledgment that the letters have been received a fellow blogger also sent the letter to a number of saudi newspaper editors and columnists but has not received responses either
7444273 everyone including children and people who can get emotionally affected easily
7444274 these pictures contradict the basics that educators and parents want to instill in their children such as a feeling of security
7444275 he any person who has access to newspapers can initiate social behavior based on these pictures which can lead to extreme behavior
7444276 any publication that promotes or presents anything that is against the shariah principles or that is against ethics and public morals or the general law is to be fined an amount that does not exceed sr20 000 or the person responsible imprisoned for no more than six months or to receive the two punishments

7444280 what was unacceptable for saudi newspapers to publish a few years ago is now accepted and published
7444281 we have shaded some parts of the picture and we also wrote a warning on the front page
7444282 the two question that should be asked before publishing these pictures are what is the message and what is the effect we want to have on people if the right answers to these questions are there we will publish the photographs otherwise we put them aside
7444283 the victim has the right to file a complaint only under one condition which is if the story and picture published were not true or accurate

7444295 zelf verlies ik met het overlijden van mgr schruers een geestelijke vader en een broeder in het bisschopsambt die als geen ander ons bisdom kende en die het bleef opvolgen ook tijdens zijn emeritaat
7444296 voor de limburgse katholieke gemeenschap is het overlijden van mgr paul schruers een groot verlies gedurende 34 jaar waarvan 19 jaar als hulpbisschop van mgr jozef maria heusschen heeft hij als bisschop ons bisdom sterk gestuurd en diepgaand geleid

7444372 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7444373 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognise the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted

7444375 i was wondering if you could tell me how to get started
7444376 it is important to know that we are united in our determination to turning around america
7444377 and by united i mean all of us the afl cio the nea change to win 17 million members 38 million potential voters in union households
7444378 i know we can count on the nea the afl cio and change to win
7444379 in key states markets where hillary clinton performed well and denver
7444380 the reality is that this is going to be barack obamas week
7444381 my personal view is that a referendum is the appropriate response to the position we are in
7444382 this is very much a personal view at this stage
7444383 if we want to retain our position as a constructive eu member state we cannot simply sit on our hands as some would have us do and keep saying that no means no
7444384 ive spoken to kerry about his situation and hes publicly stated he wants to stay at the west coast eagles
7444385 hes contracted to the football club for another year so im not really sure what all the fuss it about
7444386 hes a very important player to this football club going forward and im confident hell be at west coast next year
7444387 not evening thinking about trade negotiations until the end of the season
7444388 the judd situation was a lot different hes a victorian guy and he went home for family reasons
7444389 kerrs a west australian bloke and he loves this football club and im confident hell be here next year
7444390 kerrys his own person and im sure hell make the right decision best for him
7444391 something drastic has to happen for him not to be here next year
7444392 give us bryce gibbs marc murphy and chris judd and i would maybe consider it
7444393 its been a great challenge working at fremantle and im very optimistic about the future of the fremantle football club
7444394 im intensely proud of my contribution to fremantle and the role that i have played in its growth
7444395 the combination of roberts football experience and his ability to bring people together has been a great benefit to the club
7444396 we wish robert all the best in returning to his family melbourne and continued success in the afl
7444397 absolutely about the survival of melbourne in the short term
7444398 the solution to melbournes problems will be unique and it will boil down to a contribution from many people schwab said adding that his business plan needed to be in place before the club could make on field progress
7444399 it just felt natural to take the job after chairman jim stynes appealed to his sense of responsibility
7444400 its been a great challenge working at fremantle and im very optimistic about the future of the fremantle football club

7444403 well good luck like i say thats in the past
7444404 right now were looking forward to playing the deshis bangladesh up in darwin
7444405 well get our chance in the next 15 months to play against the poms back in england
7444406 it actually doesnt bother me at all right now said clarke in brisbane with the australian squad for a two day camp before three one day games in the tropics
7444407 its a great result for all the players just to find out whether were going or not going said clarke
7444408 i think all the guys are happy now we know now the that icc cricket australia and aca would make a decision and theyve finally done that
7444409 its a tournament title australian currently holds and next year whenever they put it on well look forward to retaining that trophy
7444410 right now all the guys are rapt the icc has made a decision
7444411 all the guys have been in contact with brett whether its via text or phone and he knows everyone is supporting him said clarke

7444419 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7444420 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7444421 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7444422 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7444423 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7444424 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions

7444486 ik ben niet van alle aandacht dus ik dacht bij mezelf welke zomergast kan ik me nog herinneren van twee jaar geleden ik kon niemand bedenken een geruststellende gedachte want zo zal het mij ook wel vergaan
7444487 you shouldnt do that shit but since you do youre not going to do it around me of to me and i will not let it affect the people i care about
7444488 i was like if youre going to chat shit to me dont chat shit to me with a smiley face right
7444489 oh i see were supposed to not give a shit i get it were english silly me
7444490 at first it was like what we were used to sometimes before
7444491 then it just kept getting worse and worse and worse
7444492 nobody told us about any mistreatment any cruelty by the georgians as they entered the houses
7444493 but after what i have seen i still think the georgian army is shameful
7444494 if the protecteur and preserver are going to be needed longer than expected we will also determine what needs to be done to keep our supply ships safe operational and available until they can be replaced
7444495 many of their systems are nearly obsolete such as the boilers they use to generate steam for main propulsion as you might expect its becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain these ships spare parts are no longer readily available and the skills needed to operate and maintain systems that were already mature in the 1960s are becoming increasingly rare
7444496 overall down the road its still a big priority for the government of canada
7444497 but for now we had to stop with that process because it bidding was definitely over and we have to provide the best value for taxpayers money
7444498 we realize the challenges that are coming and this is why i want to ensure that its still a top priority for our government and we will do everything that we can to speed up the processes
7444499 we heard a lot of noise on the ground since last friday
7444500 and i thought it was important to rectify some points
7444501 we advised first the bidders and the industry and then to be sure that the process was open and transparent we released the press release to make it clear for everybody
7444502 there has been a lot of speculation too around the canada buy policy and i just want to make sure that its clear that our government is committed to remain and keep working with that policy
7444503 if there were some visit in europe you know its the kind of thing that can happen to see how the things are done over there but it doesnt mean that we intend to breach that policy not at all
7444504 new supply ships for the navy and the 12 additional midshore patrol vessels for the coast guard are not simply luxury items but are essential to the successful day to day operations particularly in atlantic canada the coast guard plays a critical role in protecting so many who make a living at sea and this latest harper cash slash may put lives at risk
7444505 we still havent found out whos committed the crime or where exactly it happened were just in the process of investigating that
7444506 if the protecteur and preserver are going to be needed longer than expected we will also determine what needs to be done to keep our supply ships safe operational and available until they can be replaced
7444507 many of their systems are nearly obsolete such as the boilers they use to generate steam for main propulsion as you might expect its becoming increasingly difficult and costly to maintain these ships spare parts are no longer readily available and the skills needed to operate and maintain systems that were already mature in the 1960s are becoming increasingly rare
7444508 current international conventions require comparable commercial ships tankers to have double hulls and canadian environmental policy aims where feasible for warships to incorporate the highest pollution prevention standards
7444509 the surveillance system picked up a problem that was occurring and allowed us to respond efficiently and effectively to an emerging public health issue
7444510 this is an example of where our surveillance system worked
7444511 in those terms certainly i think this was a success
7444512 when theres a loss of life involved it is always tragic it should force us to review our protocols review how we deal with things and see if there are better ways we can do things
7444513 but once we were award of the situation federal officials acted very quickly
7444514 we felt given the new information we had to take the most conservative approach possible and recalled 100 per cent of the production from the entire facility
7444515 we have an unwavering commitment to keeping our food safe with the standards that go well beyond regulatory requirements
7444516 but this week our best efforts failed and for that we are deeply sorry

7444519 if i havent done anything wrong i dont need to be afraid to be scrutinized
7444520 security are here to help the people and they are usually very helpful
7444521 youre free to speak to anyone who would speak to you
7444522 but what happens to those people that you interviewed is there a price that has to be paid by them once the spotlight moves on
7444523 but i also have the freedom to buy things in the old days the goods were not available or not affordable but now we can buy anything we want
7444524 we are able to feed a huge population and provide jobs for everyone and thats basic human rights
7444525 there will be a couple of days ill go without food
7444526 im used to it i mean ive been doing it for a couple of years now its just life i guess
7444527 i dont really tell too many people whats going on
7444528 i have one friend who knows the whole story and im comfortable with him knowing
7444529 i got it when i was younger and i was stupid to get it
7444530 its one of those things where you can spend money and not really spend money at the same time
7444531 friends ask me to go out and i just cant unless i say i have no money and that puts them in a bad situation because they either feel bad because theyre eating around me and im not or they end up paying for it and then i feel bad
7444532 theyre taking retail jobs kitchen jobs grocery stores or fast food
7444533 so theyre working but they cant get enough to get out of poverty
7444534 a lot of them would love to work more but its just not there for them
7444535 we have moderately good child tax benefits and support for low income families and we have the guaranteed income supplement for seniors but what happens to everyone in between
7444536 the problem is that crisis support isnt where its at
7444537 you have to do front end poverty reduction education supports all of that stuff for prevention and then on the other end you need longer term supports like more affordable housing
7444538 we know that the higher the level of education the less likely you are to be poor so were basically setting these kids up for failure if you had daycares in high schools youre preventing those drop outs
7444539 if i had a computer at home id probably be more inclined to do it because id have my own space
7444540 ever since i was five years old ive wanted to be a teacher
7444541 every kid will have a different story some of them dont feel welcome at school some have learning disabilities that are undiagnosed some of them have anger issues and some have addiction issues

7444548 there will be a couple of days ill go without food
7444549 im used to it i mean ive been doing it for a couple of years now its just life i guess
7444550 i dont really tell too many people whats going on
7444551 i have one friend who knows the whole story and im comfortable with him knowing

7444554 friends ask me to go out and i just cant unless i say i have no money and that puts them in a bad situation because they either feel bad because theyre eating around me and im not or they end up paying for it and then i feel bad
7444555 theyre taking retail jobs kitchen jobs grocery stores or fast food
7444556 so theyre working but they cant get enough to get out of poverty
7444557 a lot of them would love to work more but its just not there for them
7444558 we have moderately good child tax benefits and support for low income families and we have the guaranteed income supplement for seniors but what happens to everyone in between
7444559 the problem is that crisis support isnt where its at
7444560 you have to do front end poverty reduction education supports all of that stuff for prevention and then on the other end you need longer term supports like more affordable housing
7444561 we know that the higher the level of education the less likely you are to be poor so were basically setting these kids up for failure if you had daycares in high schools youre preventing those drop outs
7444562 if i had a computer at home id probably be more inclined to do it because id have my own space
7444563 ever since i was five years old ive wanted to be a teacher
7444564 every kid will have a different story some of them dont feel welcome at school some have learning disabilities that are undiagnosed some of them have anger issues and some have addiction issues
7444565 the meals that we package are used to support school lunch programs
7444566 it creates a private incentive to parents enrollment doubles or sometimes triples once parents know their children can have hot meals
7444567 if we could get 1 500 students to package 300 000 meals at one school why couldnt we get 4 000 students to package 1 million meals at three schools
7444568 issues like world hunger wont end until people take a look at what needs to be done
7444569 this event shouldnt be the end its just the beginning
7444570 it makes us feel more like a community bringing people together
7444571 people are suffering i wouldnt want to be in their shoes
7444572 it would be great if more student groups want to come and help plan out this event in the future
7444573 so much food is produced in the world theres no reason why people should go hungry
7444574 we had no idea wed get this awesome of a turnout
7444575 i think this really set the precedent for what the greek communities can do to give back to the university
7444576 this is one event in which greeks have come out and mingled with the carolina community
7444577 theres a real cohesion at this event and thats something weve been pushing
7444578 this goes to show that we are all one community at carolina
7444579 its like you come out to meet your friends and the music just happens to be there
7444580 i returned seven books and only received 85 back so the guaranteed buyback will definitely give me more money
7444581 it was bad timing for faculty because its hard to review and make a commitment to a textbook in the middle of year
7444582 this coming fall has been a more appropriate and comfortable time
7444583 there is a nationwide market for books so even if its not going to be used on this campus the book can be used somewhere else
7444584 we base our buybacks on market forces and that comes down to supply and demand forces
7444585 it would make so much more sense in terms of organization and in terms of strength and planning to be able to have a central gathering place
7444586 were actually trying to stay away from designing what the center actually is
7444587 a center like that is a strong statement on the part of the university to say to the students you really are a part of our mission and our university culture and youre not just a token minority
7444588 its hard to talk to people about a new center
7444589 the first reaction is oh not another center but theres a need our job as students is to prove that need and then to find a way for the university to fill that need
7444590 money from the council doesnt come close to covering the costs of each club therefore the members have to pay a lot out of pocket
7444591 depending on the club member and travel plans it can be a burden
7444592 i expect us to be at or higher than our numbers last year
7444593 the accomplishment im most proud of is race for a reason
7444594 for the past two years weve had increasing numbers a successful race and raised a lot of money for local charities
7444595 its continuing to promote our programs to the general student body
7444596 over the next few years we are planning a lot of noteworthy things and its all student driven
7444597 it is a good promotion and a good way to give something back to people for coming in here and giving us business
7444598 i am a firm believer in us as a business giving back to the community
7444599 the objective is to give us more capability to bring materials in to catalog them and describe them so people can find them and make use of them
7444600 this is important because we dont just let people come back in the stacks
7444601 they have to look at the description and say okay i want this box so having the description online helps them maximize their research time
7444602 so what were doing is making what weve got more modern
7444603 following the idea to share that story more than in the past and help the public to share their story
7444604 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7444605 we had gone down but we are now coming up and i hope that the trend will continue like that
7444606 we are very proud of our athletes who were sent to beijing because we can still raise our heads high after the recent post election violence
7444607 tests showed muthoka failed a dope test during the national championships and we have opened disciplinary case against her she has to appear before our panel in person or a representative and respond to the charges
7444608 the academy is vital in ugandas golf development plan we hope the project takes off soon
7444609 there is no question about continental solidarity in africa wherever africans meet they say brother or sister the continent is mother africa we belong to one family
7444610 i am in glasgow but i dont pass any black person in the street without at least a nod of the head which is almost always reciprocated gregariousness is in our blood
7444611 i agree when i was studying in the uk my african classmates were always together im not saying they were not friendly to non africans just the opposite but they were really united
7444612 unity is not just about calling someone brother instead of mister
7444613 the fact that there is so much talk about unity in africa shows there is a problem
7444614 an african wins a gold and every country in africa celebrates great so why cannot they live together african countries with multi tribes chaos sometimes genocide dare i mention rwanda
7444615 many sub saharan africans blacks do not enthusiastically support teams from north africa arabs this tells me that we support teams based on the colour of their skins is this continental solidarity or narrow minded tribalism why dont we consider people from other countries and races to be our brothers
7444616 brotherhood has little to do with race i was gleeful watching ousama mellouli win gold for tunisia and of course as a kenyan watching our darling jason dunford quite white was pure magic
7444617 ill happily cheer on the rest of the countries of the british isles when scotland finally gets its independence
7444618 chris hoy a scot did not seem to have an aversion to the union flag when he wrapped himself in one after winning gold or when his tears welled up to the sound of god save the queen
7444619 not bad for a country that has no swimming pools and very little soap
7444620 i have no idea about the average australians personal hygiene
7444621 something utterly jaw dropping has happened at these games the brits have overtaken australia in the medals table
7444622 while watching the world cup zambians were confused when another english guy and myself celebrated senegal beating france they thought we would be sad because a european country had lost
7444623 we explained that firstly british people do not like very successful teams and therefore usually support the underdog and secondly we have so much history against european nations we find it hard to support them

7444629 i want to feel that she is perfect and feel myself light up when she comes into the room
7444630 i love you but im not in love with you
7444631 it is a game we should have won but we were just unlucky
7444632 there is player fatigue and it is impossible to concentrate on the league and national assignments
7444633 we have to create time for the national team this can only be done by completing the league assignments early and then concentrating on the tournaments
7444634 this will be a vital feeder to the national teams
7444635 ideally the league should end in may paving way for tournaments
7444636 based on what i saw they amazulu will be difficult to beat at home they are physical and fight till the end of the game
7444637 they have been going well i am happy with the way my players have responded to my philosophy these two drawn games 0 0 and 1 1 against amazulu give us an indication how far we have gone
7444638 but i think were it not for my joining the team late and with bloemfontein province being isolated we could have been further you see we need many games but competitive games like these are good for us i think my players should be at the level i want them want to be after five to six games
7444639 we left him behind for these pre season friendlies because of an injury he is nursing i expect him to find it hard to break into the team after the injury because ive discovered he was nagged by injuries in the last campaign i am on the lookout for another striker to complement mahlatsi and smith whom i expect to play a big role for us
7444640 mahasiswa yg dapet nilai a ntar pas udah lulus akan menjadi dosen yg dapet b jadi pegawai yg dpt c jadi pengusaha nah yg dpt d ama e inilah yg jadi anggota dpr
7444641 at the moment i remain unattached to any club but i have two offers to go back to asia that i am still undecided about the thing is i have a property development business that has taken off so well so much that it has made me think whether i really want to continue playing
7444642 so i dont know if i should leave the business and go back to football i have one week to decide and then get back to the asian guys to let them know if i am taking the offer or not my contract at my last club in malaysia expired in february this year so i am now a free agent though i left that club last year because of money problems
7444643 you have to understand that football has been good to me and i have started this business because of the game but at the moment my heart is where i am making my living from which is this business that i am running i still know that i was never a bad player and nobody can take that away from me
7444644 there is pressure in every game one plays at flyhalf because it is a key position
7444645 but i am looking forward to it you always want to judge yourself against the best and in the tri nations you are playing against the two best flyhalves every weekend that said there are 14 other men on the field who have a role to play which makes my job easier
7444646 training has gone well and were looking forward to the opportunity we have
7444647 it the record highlights the extent of the opportunity that we as a team have to achieve something significant and thats exciting
7444648 there were still chances we didnt take but looking beyond the finishing i want us more clinical overall
7444649 were not thinking of last years final at all were not giving the cheetahs any extra attention and we regard this as just another match that must be won
7444650 weve toured a lot this year and the players are thinking of home
7444651 i would like to think that if wed played a lot of one day cricket recently then wed deserve our tag as favourites but at the moment were pretty undercooked in that area so were keeping our feet firmly on the ground
7444652 i thought id sneaked that injury in below the radar
7444653 i guess thats what has been worrying me the whole series its been getting worse and worse i had a scan the other day and i will have to take a significant break from the game at some stage for it to get better
7444654 ive been working with our medical staff and ill have to take some time off exactly when that will be will have to be discussed
7444655 the real issue is that the airport authority is being formed in a way that bypasses input from the community and our elected officials
7444656 if done properly and done sensibly and done sustainably it could be an asset to the community
7444657 the legislation ignores our zoning and land use ordinances as well as our own environmental and economic plans the claims of economic benefit are suspicious particularly since there is no economic plan related to this project
7444658 theres a need for aviation theres a lot of business that comes through that comes to orange county or chapel hill and they fly its easier for them to get here a more efficient and quicker means of transportation
7444659 this will also be a public body subject to all of the open meetings and open records law
7444660 i mean we dont cheap shot in practice and a couple kids were clipped
7444661 we dont do that in practice but i think our kids are prepared for that kind of physical confrontation because one thing we pride ourselves on at unc is the intensity of our practices reflects matches
7444662 i had that breakaway in the first that was horrible
7444663 i could not believe i missed that and then i had another breakaway after
7444664 we were pleased with the way we were creating chance after chance after chance
7444665 we were doing a great job of finishing with our head
7444666 i dont know last year why we couldnt put it away but this year everyones going after it
7444667 it is possible an agreement will be reached in the next two weeks
7444668 if i havent done anything wrong i dont need to be afraid to be scrutinized
7444669 security are here to help the people and they are usually very helpful
7444670 youre free to speak to anyone who would speak to you
7444671 but what happens to those people that you interviewed is there a price that has to be paid by them once the spotlight moves on
7444672 but i also have the freedom to buy things in the old days the goods were not available or not affordable but now we can buy anything we want
7444673 we are able to feed a huge population and provide jobs for everyone and thats basic human rights
7444674 china is such a big country there are so many people with two political parties it would only create conflict
7444675 arsenal will be fine as long as wenger pulls his finger out
7444676 grunden til at jeg skifter nu er at stillingen i coloplast simpelthen l d for sp ndende coloplast er en klassisk dansk virksomhed der f rer an i globaliseringen
7444677 telia er jo ikke en danskejet virksomhed selvom datterselskabet er ganske stort i danmark det betyder at arbejdet i telia dk ikke involverer det fulde globale perspektiv i virksomheden det bliver derfor godt at komme ind i en virksomhed hvor kerneforretningen styres fra danmark og ud i verden det betyder at danmark er headquarters og det er der jeg gerne vil v re hvor jeg er med til at s tte dagsordenen for her bliver det ogs lettere at komme t ttere p virksomhedens strategiudvikling og pr ge den med kommunikationst nkning
7444678 jeg har f et massiv erfaring med en bred vifte af opgaver virksomheder og m der at organisere sig p hvert sted jeg har v ret har l rt mig noget nyt om organisation ledelse forretning og det har jeg brugt til hele tiden at blive bedre til kommunikation
7444679 det er jo det hele det er selvf lgelig vigtigt at man har international erfaring og er internationalt orienteret man skal v re skarp p at forst og h ndtere sine stakeholders investor relations og public affairs er sv re fag som til geng ld er rasende vigtige branding p godt og ondt er et centralt omdrejningspunkt og man m ogs kunne sin eksterne og interne kommunikation til punkt og prikke man skal med andre ord v re en kommunikat r med generalistviden og kompetencer
7444680 en helt central ting for mig er kombinationen af det kommunikations strategiske perspektiv og det konkrete operationelle drive s der sker eksekvering
7444681 opgaven er at l re ledelsen at t nke kommunikation ind p det verste strategiske niveau mens man som kommunikat r m vise sit v rd og kunne sine tal p et forretningsstrategisk niveau samtidigt er det vigtigt at man kan g re kommunikation vigtig for mellemledere og medarbejderne
7444682 jeg har gennem rene l rt en del om hvordan man skaber forandring en af de centrale ting er at vise direktionen hvor vigtig man er for forretningen s f r man mere r derum og frihed til at g re det der er vigtigt nemlig at lave god og relevant kommunikation der er forretningskritisk
7444683 det vigtigste aktie i enhver kommunikationsafdeling er medarbejdernes drive ledelse i en kommunikationsafdeling handler derfor om at skabe det drive og f det til vokse hos medarbejderne
7444684 det er jo ikke f rste gang at jeg starter i en ny organisation jeg har et enkelt trick som jeg har brugt 120 konsekvent helt tilbage fra bg bank tiden jeg starter ganske enkelt med at snakke med alle medarbejderne laver m der med ledere opinionsdannere og centrale personer i og uden for virksomheden og bliver ved og ved i telia havde jeg lavet 74 interviews i l bet af de to f rste m neder pointen er at jeg m der alle de folk der kommer til at betyde noget meget hurtigt samtidig med at jeg kommer godt rundt i virksomheden g r man det ikke i starten bliver det aldrig gjort s det er en investering der er givet s godt ud og s kan jeg bagefter samle tr dene til den samlede forst else af kommunikationssituationen
7444685 det nytter ikke noget at komme v ltende med en masse planer for hvordan verden skal se ud jeg er n dt til at finde ud hvor medarbejderne befinder sig det er jo ogs dem der har den dyrebare viden som man har brug for
7444686 jeg skal v re leder for 20 25 dygtige mennesker i afdelingen og det kr ver selvf lgelig nogle refleksioner over hvad god ledelse egentlig er jeg tror noget af det vigtigste er at man viser tillid til medarbejderne og forst r at de mange gange g r rundt med rigtig gode id er og et engagement der bare skal have de rette betingelser for at blomstre det g lder om at give frihed og skabe de rette rammer for at folk kan bidrage af lyst som leder mener jeg det er vigtigt at jeg kan skabe f llesskabet for afdelingen den f lles mening og en f lles historie alle har lyst til at arbejde p det giver drive
7444687 der g r ikke en dag uden at jeg har v ret oppe i det verste lag af maslows behovspyramide det er simpelthen en fantastisk branche og et sjovt fag
7444688 n r de minst venter det trer vi fram fra skyggene og samler oss i sentrum for get down and dirty ta med forsyninger for gj re kapitalistfesten deres til v r egen
7444689 we took the bacon down to one day a week
7444690 its just something everyone loves you walk in schools and smell that bacon frying and the kids go crazy
7444691 its time for a change i may be old but i am an old person who believes in young ideas
7444692 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7444693 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7444694 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7444695 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7444696 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7444697 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7444698 i want to share with you just how cool horace williams was
7444699 i have no higher ambition than to serve my university
7444700 buy milk from the horace williams dairy recently inspected by the health department
7444701 he had a lasting affect on the university and the nation
7444702 he taught not what to think but how to think
7444703 i know this is going to sound kind of bizarre but we were pleased with the way we were playing
7444704 if you watched a highlight reel of the first half we had many sitters that we missed so what that was telling me is this team is going to create some scoring chances the law of averages tells us you will eventually finish those
7444705 all you can ask for is chances in a game
7444706 so as long as i put one away i think it was good
7444707 i think the finishing has improved this year and our general attacking play is a lot better we have a lot more variety in the attack
7444708 tavolo di lavoro per discutere dei fenomeni di disagio giovanile
7444709 you get a bunch of really cool people together who get really excited about the things youre working on
7444710 i also want people to have a good time and get to know each other
7444711 i think the cabinets a great place to start that bonding process
7444712 im thrilled to bring sara back to chapel hill and back into our program
7444713 this more scientific evidence of character might warrant a new approach in the future
7444714 we controlled for ethnicity and did not notice many differences in delinquency by race
7444715 anything within our control well do in the short term
7444716 then were going to present a long term plan to happen in the next year and a half
7444717 the records are closed for the juvenile so they treat teenagers as first time offenders when in fact they may have a lengthy juvenile record
7444718 the gang steps in and says we have something for you
7444719 youre not dealing with a subculture youre dealing with a counterculture
7444720 guruji soren came to my residence and asked for my support in forming the government i told him that let me first call on madhu koda before giving my consent
7444721 every one has given their consent only i am left
7444722 because god rested on the seventh day we um work extra hard so that we can build idols and stuff
7444723 i auditioned knowing nothing about the group or what it was
7444724 i was just thinking that i maybe wanted to do comedy stuff never having really seen improvised theater
7444725 its this room full of people and all of chips is there
7444726 we get two people up on stage who volunteer to improvise together and we give them a suggestion and they do a brief scene as auditions progress we give them constructive notes and see how they take those notes and adapt
7444727 the audition environment sets everybody up for success because its overwhelmingly positive
7444728 i think it changes you as a person i dont think you can be in this organization or even audition for chips or do the incubator program and have it not change you
7444729 you learn so much about yourself you really have to open up and put yourself out there
7444730 having these three systems interconnected will really improve the water security in this community
7444731 weve cut the draw from our reservoir in half in the last year
7444732 that takes the behavioral part out of it and puts the technology in it
7444733 if you followed our program last year you know there wasnt a week that went by where we werent taking a player who played this position and moving them to either another position or the other side of the ball
7444734 i knew it was going to be a tough transaction but i feel like ive done pretty good so far
7444735 they all take their turn its like you have to pick the poison with those guys
7444736 going against them i think that helped me so much more because playing against the best is going to get you prepared for the season
7444737 fails to pierce the vision that beholds it fails to destroy the antique acceptances
7444738 im going to be tasting that end zone in the first home game
7444739 i feel like i explode better last year id get to the hole but i wouldnt hit the hole like i could
7444740 now i feel like when i see the hole i can hit it and im moving through it im more swift and more compact
7444741 our trainer told me that right after workouts you have this window that you can burn fat easier if you get on the treadmill and get some work in
7444742 extravaganzas of schmoozing networking and entertaining for politicians and party leaders underwritten by the same corporations and interest groups that spend billions lobbying congress and funding campaigns

7444757 the european union therefore takes the leading position its a victory for sport and for the fundamental and common values of the people of the union
7444758 the comparison of the eu against china or the us is of course not entirely fair

7444771 it actually took us a really long time to write 17 pages
7444772 but we had never done a film before and we had a story to tell and we both wanted a challenge in our lives as we approached a certain age
7444773 but filming it is another thing and we didnt realize wed set ourselves a monumental challenge its funny though when we started to tell people wed actually written this film a comedy about grief some people looked alarmed i guess because theyre afraid of a grief thats too terrible to laugh at but most of the women we spoke to had a look of instant recognition on their face their response was just to burst into laughter that was really interesting
7444774 the moments when the penny drops when a decision is made when something becomes clear or maybe a little too clear
7444775 these people are all doing something new for the first time theyre all slightly nervous but it was wonderful watching people take those leaps of faith
7444776 it was inspiring to watch people learning from others ultimately we hope this project inspires other people of any age to try something new
7444777 our little film how are you is really a film full of recognizable moments and when we were making it we kept hearing from people like our producer sonya di rienzo flamenco at 5 15 or the sound person or someone in makeup or hair who said they would love to make a film about a pivotal life changing moment and we started to think wouldnt it be a great idea for all these people to work on individual films and then parcel them together in a mosaic that reflects real life moments of enlightenment amongst the filmmakers
7444778 the difficulty of short films of course is that the ramp up is so huge for three days of filming
7444779 to get a whole film crew together and raise the money the idea here is to pool our resources and be able to film the shorts over two weeks using the same director of photography david franco and the same crew so it seems like a smart idea actually just the process of filling out applications is so daunting for some people the producers in our group are able to help with that it just helps people get up to speed much faster
7444780 they say everyone has a novel in them but not many people have time to write a novel
7444781 but i actually think everyone has a short film in them making it however is a very difficult discipline to narrow it down to 10 minutes or three has its own challenges this is an opportunity to really get this kind of experience in microcosm
7444782 how are you evolved out of conversations we shared with each other our friends and acquaintances we decided to take the leap into unknown territory for the simple reason weve reached an age and point in our lives when we needed a new challenge
7444783 this film is about a certain kind of grief that we all have to deal with at a certain age
7444784 when youre in your 20s you think wow thats not going to happen to me but then we reach a certain age maybe its your 30s or your 40s when you realize oh im part of that too grief is now part of my story so how are you is about a turning point where you have to figure out how to go forward from here
7444785 shorts often end up just being seen by people who go to film festivals or film school
7444786 you think we can live on what you make at the yankee dollar
7444787 there were a a couple things we couldnt do in transformers 1 due to budget but also because they seemed too
7444788 yes we do get a bit more dough expect an upgrade and we also know better what we can do this time to maximize the mighty buck and we have the secret weapon that is ian bryce
7444789 going by the length of the script can be tricky because the action is longer in reality than on the page were trying to keep it to two hours but i get a feeling itll be about the same as movie 1
7444790 transformers had 3 plot lines a boy and his car soldiers behind enemy lines and defense policy people all reacting to transformers in a somewhat multiple point of view disaster movie paradigm and structure part two will be a different paradigm more like parallel stories
7444791 the story for part 2 is more global for sure
7444792 back to the future jurassic park close encounters and terminator 2
7444793 we were emulating the style of movie from the old amblin days like back to the future and gremlins which if you watch today are still very funny also the cartoon itself was quite funny also comedy makes things more accessible to a larger audience
7444794 we knew the names of most but michael bay was so upset by leak that he put out a bit of disinformation even claiming that we the writers had no idea which characters we were writing which as i hope is painfully obvious is absurd on its face
7444795 the first movie is all about the mystery and reveal of the transformers as a concept and a species which means we had to hide them a lot in the first hour in the second movie now that everyone believes in the universe we can jump right into the world of the transformers
7444796 the hardest aspect is that you lose the element of surprise we got away with a lot in the first movies because for a long time no one thought it would work or that it was just a silly cartoon and simply proving that wrong is all we had to do the first movie was meant to be somewhat of a mystery for the sequel we need an entirely different structure and paradigm for the movie and we cant rely on it being the first
7444797 one of the themes is about the responsibilities you face when being away from home reflected by sam going to college and by the fact that the transformers themselves are of course far from cybertron
7444798 rumors are not exactly true he came he read for a while and he left then days later we had a meeting with him to talk about his concerns all of which were simple to deal with he wanted to make sure it wasnt too close to the characters hed been playing and we told him it would be our pleasure to differentiate him we all left the meeting smiling and laughing and his agents and the studio started negotiating we just couldnt come up with a mutually satisfactory deal sometimes its s scheduling conflict sometimes its that an actor only wants to agree to be in one movie at a time etc so all i can figure is some one who doesnt know much saw him leave the read early and assumed the rest no hard feelings here
7444799 teaser will surely come out before the end of the year
7444800 alex kurtzman came up with the title and it was the only one we put up on the cover of the script

7444802 when we are committed and involved in our childrens lives we can teach them by example and discussion how to avoid violent situations when parents take an interest in school work participate in school events teach their children how to manage anger or talk with their children about rules at school and home they are helping to provide their children with alternatives to violence
7444803 your parents definitely have an influence on you my culture if i had to give a percentage i would say its 80 percent the local culture and 20 percent theirs
7444804 when i go over there its not like i feel normal there i feel normal here
7444805 i felt uniquely situated to write a book like that having one foot here and one foot in the middle east
7444806 middle eastern people are kind of split up they have one line of thinking about the american people and another line of thinking about the american government when they spoke of the american people they had positive things to say about the american people that theyre honest people very decent people
7444807 reacting and reeling from the initial response to the storm
7444808 we had personality problems and we got frustrated and one thing leads to another and everybody thinks theyre right
7444809 its like we brought them in here and just said survive
7444810 we recognized a need to address how students experience that first year of college
7444811 transforming the learning process into a more active experiential one was the most pressing concerns
7444812 it came up most often we need to find ways to make students active partners in the learning process
7444813 doing community outreach participating in projects across departments then theres a better chance theyll reach graduation
7444814 it benefits a student to be as engaged in their campus community as possible
7444815 its more than just being in class for 50 minutes building a community you can rely on helps get you through
7444816 we have to always work to educate our students and improve what we offer them
7444817 but students also have to get involved beyond the classroom and make those connections
7444818 we dont expect freshmen to arrive knowing what theyre going to do with their lives
7444819 but if we refocus that first year we can help them realize what their goals are sooner

7444832 in effect it was like a psychological war a fear psychosis was created where people panicked about shortage of medicines and milk for children about truckloads of apples rotting how much was fact and how much rumor no one knows
7444833 the only solution is to get people back on the table to talk
7444834 but for that they need to wait for passions to cool
7444835 they themselves are not agreed on whether they want freedom or merger with pakistan
7444836 they wont give up their personal security but will demand troops be removed from the valley
7444837 you may not want to help me after you hear the rest of what ive got to say im taking michelle with me
7444838 nobody emphasized public service what was emphasized was doing what you love to do and youll be good at whatever you do
7444839 her father asked her dont you want to pay your student loans
7444840 im sure at sidley she made more money than her parents ever made
7444841 it just seemed incredible at the time that shed leave
7444842 her being from chicago from the southside of chicago was an asset to barack in terms of enhancing his ties to the community
7444843 he couldve gone to wall street those offers were available to him but instead barack bussed these young mothers down to city hall to help them find their voice and advocate for change
7444844 everyone had said at the time that the best young organizer in chicago was barack
7444845 at a time when the average age of our staff was 23 she was like drafting brett favre for the packers
7444846 michelle was 29 when we hired her she had a law degree from harvard had worked for the mayor for a corporate law firm comparatively id worked a telemarketing group frankly we were surprised that she wanted to do it
7444847 she was a connector they were a power couple they helped each other along the way
7444848 each ally was placed with a not for profit about 20 30 a year when you think of the number of people who got to know who michelle was and by extension barack thats a whole generation from all over chicago
7444849 no really baracks a hustler i shouldnt say hustler but hes a humper in terms of work
7444850 neither abkhazia nor south ossetia will be part of the georgian sate
7444851 it shows the level of desperation and abuse of power by the barisan nasional
7444852 i am confident god willing we will win but we are fighting an entire government machinery which has spent millions of dollars in an attempt to deny me a victory
7444853 yes there are mps in the ruling party that have expressed support for me
7444854 the issue of the sodomy allegations while it gained some traction at the beginning of the campaign by the end had reached saturation point and wont significantly affect his chances of winning
7444855 if you look at the ground support it is extremely good but we have to make sure there is no cheating
7444856 i voted for wan azizah i will vote for anwar ibrahim because i want the barisan nasional to be toppled
7444857 we encourage the government of china to demonstrate respect for human rights including freedom of expression and freedom of religion of all people during the olympic games and beyond
7444858 we are disappointed that china has not used the occasion of the olympics to demonstrate greater tolerance and openness
7444859 the prime minister did make it clear to china that she should be released
7444860 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7444861 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish
7444862 and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7444863 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7444864 the military operation was started for achieving some basic objectives we wanted to ensure protection to lives and property of the people and dispel the impression from the minds of residents that the government had lost its writ in bajaur

7444867 as the police and the crpf were warning the protesters to disperse peacefully a pistol shot fired from within the mob hit a crpf jawan trooper injuring him critically the crpf retaliated and 11 protesters were injured
7444868 we have arrested malik and his supporters have peacefully dispersed after his arrest
7444869 what you call the routine drill of keeping these gentlemen under house arrest where they freely received guests and visitors who would be shown in by armed guards provided by the government has been broken now
7444870 initially indications from the official quarters were that foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi would lead the pakistani delegation
7444871 however due to recent political developments and a crucial resolution on the judges restoration expected to be tabled in the national assembly this week a decision was taken at the highest level to send durrani instead
7444872 the question of the expansion of the organisation is also expected to be taken up by the sco leaders at the summit it is believed that accession criteria are currently being reviewed to provide for admission of new members
7444873 an important proposal likely to be approved by the heads of state of the member countries pertains to the real involvement of observers and other interested countries which may become dialogue partners in practical work within the sco framework
7444874 they also agreed to a proposal on the sco dialogue partners that will allow all the interested countries to interact with the organisation and participate in all its activities projects and meetings
7444875 phul sharief stunned everyone including the judge and lawyers in the court when he informed them that he had undergone a sex change operation after being divorced by his wife sharief then married a man

7444877 the development of the state should take precedence whichever government is in power
7444878 independents are making a mockery of the democratic system the game of numbers has enabled independents to take the state to ransom

7444880 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue
7444881 past research has shown that the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis bi 35624 can positively impact the bodys immune defence and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract
7444882 i think he wants to fight those big mega fights because thats the kind of fight we want to be involved with right now
7444883 i think its a combination of seeing what the potential opponent is and also seeing what the ufc wants to do at the end of the day this is a business and they need to sell fights they need to sell a lot of pay per views and they need to sell tickets so we want to be involved with those types of fights
7444884 were not looking past patrick cote but i think well take one step at a time and see what happens but yeah if a chuck liddell fight came up wed take it
7444885 whoever the ufc wants to put in front of us he wants to fight the best and whoever that may be at the time thats who he wants to fight
7444886 its kind of like playing michigan its a lot like playing michigan
7444887 we like to play people like that we know the odds are against us to begin with but its great exposure for our program its something that gets our players motivated all summer and its great recognition for the school
7444888 to an extent i dont know that michigan underestimated us or under questioned us
7444889 programs like that generally dont do that i think we might have surprised them a little bit with our speed and stuff like that we were probably just a little bit better football team maybe than they knew and maybe even we knew at that time
7444890 armanti right now is seeing so many more things down the field than he did a year ago
7444891 it kind of gets annoying we didnt win a ring off of michigan after that we went through the whole season luckily we had our heads on straight
7444892 like most schools we have an early morning running program
7444893 we run at six oclock the day it the lsu game became public it was just like the tempo changed and we picked it up a notch running even at six oclock in the morning and here we are five six months away form playing the players know whats ahead of them

7444899 if they think a patient will gain an extra year of life but it will cost more than 20 000 they think it is not cost effective yet if the patient wants to pay for it themselves they are denied nhs treatment its an outrage
7444900 the nhs was built on the foundation of caring for the community it was designed to help those who needed help care for those who needed care and treat those who needed treatment
7444901 those basic principles have been lost as the government takes us down a dangerous path that can only be a catastrophic meltdown of the system

7444924 im not against it i dont think its the most important thing for doctor who
7444925 a movie is one 90 minutes a year so yes so long as it never gets in the way of the show if it gets in the way of the show thats appalling
7444926 its been in the cinema with peter cushing it would be good to see it in the cinema so long as its great and fantastic
7444927 its a practical issue this is a show thats hard for even the young super fit david tennant to keep up with it might kill someone over 60
7444928 we have provided daleks and components for the tardis in the past and i think a one off move to the big screen would be amazing
7444929 it would take doctor who to the next level the show has a worldwide appeal so should be very successful
7444930 i think david tenant is an excellent doctor who is perfect for the part because he is eccentric and a nice guy too

7444935 earlier the casualty ward received between 100 to 150 patients only today the number has increased to 800 the challenge is greater but resources insufficient
7444936 i had always been passionate about giving something back to my society which is why i chose to do medicine when i joined as a medical officer in 1989 and witnessed the poor condition of state run hospitals i decided to work towards a change i wanted to uplift the ward i was given charge of and prove that the government sector can also deliver if provided with the funds and opportunity this i was able to do over the years
7444937 the emergency ward at the jpmc karachi is possibly the only ward in the country where doctors are constantly busy if there is no political clash or bomb blast we are dealing with deaths from epidemics rain and what not
7444938 there were about 250 injured brought to the hospital and the chaos was unimaginable
7444939 in an urban city like karachi where suicide bombings clashes and political killings are common it is difficult to remain stress free but with time we learnt to handle one difficult situation after another
7444940 my official timings are from 8 00 am to 2 00 pm but i never return home on time and am unable to have lunch with my children it would always take me another three hours to wrap up
7444941 the world would be a poorer place without doctor who
7444942 that bore in the pub who delivers the punchline of a joke a second before it is delivered
7444943 for doctor who to turn into an old man youd be pissed off
7444944 even william hartnell had trouble back then he was often ill and he forgot his lines i think the doctor will always be about 40

7445099 long long time ago some wise scientists discovered that because our bodies are so heavy and our wing beat is so short we cannot generate enough lift to fly yes sweetie
7445100 yes indeed but it wasnt always like this when i was about your age my great grandmother who was the first bee to live in our burrow told me that when she was a little girl she saw once during harvest fest a wingedbee
7445101 she also said that the wingdbee was very old and she was in a cage because she belonged to the circus
7445102 exactly like the ones in the cartoons zoey how else do you think they would have managed to think of a wingedbee if nobody had ever seen one there were wingedbees long ago but nobody ever talks about this anymore its like bees are now so ashamed they are wingless that theyd rather forget they ever had them
7445103 and then they came up with this stupid explanation about the weight and the wing beat and shit just to cover the big ugly disaster that the coalition with the ant imperrium brought yeah yeah nobody will ever forget that no matter how hard the government will try to mask it behind revolutionary theories theyve really blown it with the experiment and thats the whole truth bees will never be able to fly never again

7445154 don bradmans test average 99 94 runs per dismissal is entrenched in australian folklore and the story of the dons final innings out for a duck when just four runs would have taken his average to 100 has been told countless times
7445155 just four runs spread over a career of almost 20 years and more than 197 hours at the crease it is worth asking just how sure can we be that the number is correct
7445156 as it happens my recent research has shown that it could be wrong a tantalising clue to four missing runs has been found
7445157 in the scorebook of the epic eight day fifth test of 1928 29 against england in melbourne won by australia by five wickets there is a
7445158 the relevant sections of bill fergusons original score are illustrated there are four runs attributed to ryder that are in the wrong place in both the batting section of the score and in the bowling section maurice tates 35th over there is no doubt that a recording error of some kind has occurred so where do these runs belong
7445159 perhaps ryder scored them at some other point of the innings perhaps they were not scored at all in which case australia technically did not win the match more importantly perhaps they were scored by bradman just perhaps
7445160 you will not find a scorebook that says bradman scored x when the accepted score is y it is more subtle a batsmans strokes may not add up to his score or more commonly there are mismatches between strokes attributed to batsmen and the strokes marked against bowlers
7445161 there are surviving scorebooks for many tests of the past all but seven of bradmans tests are represented preserved in libraries at lords cricket nsw and elsewhere
7445162 there are a number of possible resolutions to the question over ryders four runs in that melbourne test of 1928 29 they are complicated by the presence of an unmarked leg bye
7445163 at least one resolution involves transferring the boundary to bradman
7445164 most of bradmans scorebooks have not been checked at this level of detail it is painstaking work however the chances of finding other anomalies based on experience with many other scores seem high

7445205 axis bank certainly has lost a substantial ground from the top but the valuations are fair it is quoting up at 18 times the current year earning it is quoting at about 2 5 times the book value so it is fairly priced so it is going to be a market performer actually but there are opportunities in small private sector banks because post 2009 i am pretty sure and i am very hopeful that many of these banks will either be taken over or merged with larger entities of the private sector space so companies like a federal bank south indian bank which continues to be my favorite it is quoting at about 7 times the current years earnings it is quoting at less than 1 time price to book value these companies will see substantial upward movement in their prices vis vis these banks so i am hopeful of the small private sector banks than the larger ones

7445428 by enacting this chapter the general assembly ensures the people of the commonwealth ready access to public records in the custody of a public body or its officers and employees and free entry to meetings of public bodies wherein the business of the people is being conducted
7445429 the meetings including work sessions when sitting physically or through telephonic or video equipment pursuant to 2 2 37 8 or 2 2 3708 1 as a body or entity or as an informal assemblage of i as many as three members or ii a quorum if less than three of the constituent membership wherever held with or without minutes being taken whether or not votes are cast of any public body

7445446 by not calling evidence the crown has to draw all the strings together and try and come up with a common thread and then we have an opportunity to hear the entirety of that argument before we make ours

7445481 interchangeability of the image of the neurasthenic and the jew
7445482 because of the eight she said the plane crash was a tragedy
7445483 six million poles about 22 of the population were killed by the nazis half of whom were jews
7445484 taking almost as many shapes and appearances as there existed countries in europe
7445485 not a single bulgaria jew had been deported or died an unnatural death
7445486 if it is true that mankind has insisted on murdering jews for more than two thousand years
7445487 then jew killing is a normal and even human occupation and jew hatred is justified beyond the need of argument
7445488 in the eyes of jews the catastrophe that had befallen them under hitler appeared not as the most recent of crimes the unprecedented crime of genocide but on the contrary as the oldest crime they knew and remembered
7445489 if i knew that it was possible to save all the children of germany by transporting them to england but only half of them by transporting them to palestine i would chose the second
7445490 it should come as little surprise that the missionary efforts to bring lost jews back to the torah should spill over into the christian and pagan world and that judaism should attract proselytes among the slavs jewish owned slaves while they were still legally allowed had good reason to convert for they might thereby gain their freedom but there were also many who found that the spiritual wealth of the jews as well as their worldly success offered greater rewards than their own christian lifestyle
7445491 freedom of choice and social acceptance are the most powerful forces behind national moods moneys pretty powerful but its not the whole story says inglehart though he maintains that
7445492 whats more there are diminishing returns to economic progress inglehart says

7445495 virtually every single one of our international sports were either invented or codified by the british and i say this respectfully to our chinese hosts who have excelled so magnificently at ping pong
7445496 ping pong was invented on the dining tables of england in the 19th century and it was called wiff waff
7445497 there i think you have the essential difference between us and the rest of world
7445498 other nations the french looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to have dinner we looked at a dining table and saw an opportunity to play wiff waff that is why london is the sporting capital of the world
7445499 and i say to the chinese and i say to the world ping pong is coming home
7445500 i think there is a world market for maybe 5 computers
7445501 because i know that as successful as i believe we will be and i believe that the success will be fairly easy we will still lose some american young men or women
7445502 were not going to get into house to house fighting in baghdad we may have to take out buildings but were not going to have a bloodletting of trading american bodies for iraqi bodies
7445503 but the point is that one we will win this conflict we will win it easily
7445504 but i believe katie that the iraqi people will greet us as liberators
7445505 its clear that the end is very much in sight
7445506 there are neighborhoods in baghdad where you and i could walk through those neighborhoods today
7445507 general petraeus goes out there iraq almost everyday in an unarmored humvee
7445508 i meant that there are neighborhoods that are safe in iraq and he does go out into baghdad and the fact is there has been significant progress
7445509 im not say that they vips could go without protection the president goes around america with protection so i certainly didnt say that
7445510 on 26 mar you said there are areas in baghdad that you can walk around freely
7445511 no but thats not too important whats important are the casualties
7445512 im going to be honest i know a lot less about economics than i do about military and foreign policy issues i still need to be educated
7445513 the issues of economics is not something ive understood as well as i should
7445514 i dont have the kind of expertise to know exactly whether he has cut interest rates sufficiently or not
7445515 i think you could argue that americans overall are better off because we have had a pretty good prosperous time with low unemployment and low inflation and a lot of good things have happened a lot of jobs have been created
7445516 in fact i think americans are not better off than they were eight years ago when you look at whats happened to middle income americans
7445517 theres not a history of clashes that are violent between sunnis and shiahs so i think they can probably get along
7445518 one of the things i would do if i were president would be to sit the shiites and the sunnis down and say stop the bullshit
7445519 i dont know if i would want him as vice president he and i have the same strengths but to serve in other capacities hell yeah
7445520 we have had some success working with the pakistanis in a low visible fashion should they be more helpful of course they should be should the saudis be more helpful should the jordanians be more helpful should the egyptians we are giving billions of dollars a year to the egyptians as you know and they should be more helpful should the mexicans be more helpful everybody should be more helpful

7445522 as long as its inevitable you might as well lie back and enjoy it
7445523 the united states supreme court yesterday rendered a decision which i think is one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
7445524 still mccain has yet to find his voice on domestic issues his response to a question about crime among teen girls veered from a little rock mentoring program to nicaraguan drug lords to securing the mexican border to the rural meth epidemic then ended with the not so confident words
7445525 im not for quote privatizing social security i never have been i never will be
7445526 without privatization i dont see how you can possibly over time make sure that young americans are able to receive social security benefits
7445527 the media often overlooked how compassionately hillary spoke to the concerns and dreams of millions
7445528 i did not say that that was in prepared remarks and i did not say it im not in the business of commenting on the press and their coverage or not coverage
7445529 the divisive forces which had come into focus as a result of the antiwar movement in the united states
7445530 i hated the gooks i will hate them as long as i live

7445547 everybody wants to talk about nba players being selfish being arrogant being individuals what you saw today was a team bonded together facing adversity and coming out of here with a big win
7445548 i think this is a testament to the system that mr colangelo put in place
7445549 these players have given of themselves for three years theyve given up their summers theyve bought into the whole team thing they set their personal egos aside theyve done everything asked of them

7445552 if the government pushes forward with its mega projects including infrastructure construction as well as creating confidence among investors our gdp in the last six months of this year is most likely to be no less than 5 2 per cent
7445553 therefore we expect only one more 25 basis point hike from the bank of thailand and this should be the last rate hike for the rest of this year

7445567 these are people that i thought were partners that we go in fires and come out together and i trust these people going in and out on the job
7445568 its a very difficult time for me right now i feel betrayed in a way after all these years
7445569 they dont know my pain since 2000 thats for sure they dont know who i am and how i have been dealing with this all my career on the fire department and how i have worked around it

7445697 the administrations basic approach to foreign policy and national security i think has been bankrupted by reality the fixation on pre emption regime change and the simplistic slogans that encompass the war on terror i think literally not figuratively made us less secure made us less secure as a nation rather than more secure

7445796 the agenda was secret until maurice blurted it and the prospect of having the 50 extra tax cut they promised the average worker snatched away by the weekly toll bill of course makes it clear their policies are all about taking with one hand giving with the other
7445797 if theres going to be tolling where they are paying then government should be looking at whether it can offset that by lower petrol prices

7445817 its something i probably need to talk to the ffa about just to have a clarification about that ruling but certainly we know that you can make a change right up to just before the game starts
7445818 with the building and everything going on theres nowhere for the water to go
7445819 they just really need to look at the whole plan
7445820 that snake will cut your throat i dont trust him youll see
7445821 these lettuces here are finished now so what you see has now gone to waste
7445822 we would have had about a 25 percent cut out here and normally we would have up to 85 percent
7445823 the demand is still there but with the amount of rain its affected our ability to harvest to process and even our planting has been affected as well
7445824 instead of buying potatoes and making fries with them its just cheaper to buy a bag of frozen oven fries
7445825 people are wanting to become a bit less reliant on the oil food system and are taking practical steps to taking care of themselves
7445826 at the moment things are short and itll hold on till christmas cause they havent been able to plant
7445827 everything green broccoli lettuce anything green has generally gone up in price i dont think anything has come back
7445828 firstly at the markets there wasnt a lot of product on the floor straight away you realised things were going to be dear
7445829 food is only going to get more expensive and of a lower quality
7445830 we need to get more areas like this going in the city
7445831 there are all these areas around the city that are grass and being mowed
7445832 if we can bring our food protection and life support system closer its going to be healthier
7445833 a lot of people say their garden produces beautiful greens better than mine
7445834 but i never see them i always say ill pay good money for those organic lettuces but nah i never see them
7445835 and it hasnt hurt our chances of getting high paying jobs in government
7445836 i have personally been told by many of our child cadres that they felt the march was a success largely because it happened on a school day
7445837 in fact they have demanded that cosas stage a similar march every friday and perhaps some thursdays as well in order to fully enflame their patriotic zeal
7445838 donuts maybe a dj and a jumping castle also to increase their awareness of the injustice facing comrade zuma
7445839 as for the issue of the funds we used we will not apologize the people who pay tax are mostly those who have passed matric and clearly this is not our demographic
7445840 nobody even vaguely connected with cosas has passed matric or come close on a second or third attempt and we are determined to uphold those traditions in the coming years
7445841 even if i knew what a fodder was i would deny this
7445842 we are simply helping nurture and develop new skills that that are in desperately short supply in this country
7445843 voting for msholozi and writing protest manifestos in tipex on the doors of public toilets
7445844 have the burden of education lifted from them so that they can be free to fully engage in the revolution
7445845 if our grade ones can vote why expend resources on controversial and damaging activities like teaching them how to read or do sums
7445846 in our view we need a much more nurturing education system for our little ones whereby all the do at school is show and tell
7445847 hence we are testing on women then dogs and then chimps in that order
7445848 where i am what i am doing who i am with
7445849 all the base elements technical things they are all base elements the reality is what makes an award winning image is emotion and so the judges are looking for the emotion
7445850 some people are just flies on the wall and can watch and they know the moments they can predict when its going to happen and they are there already at that point in time
7445851 other people make photographs they create the energy within the people so that when they make their photograph there is a lot of emotion happening
7445852 its not just a matter of turning up somewhere and hoping to get good photos
7445853 theres a lot of thought that goes into what are we going to do where are we going to go are we going to use props
7445854 people that are shooting from quite a long distance and just picking the shots off with a long lens and not being intrusive letting everything unfold and grabbing the moments as they happen
7445855 digital has really changed a lot a lot of people are experimenting a lot more
7445856 a hundred years from now formals are going to be really important photos so although the arty photos are fantastic and the candids are fantastic when your great grandkids are looking at your wedding album and they can see their great grandmother thats probably more important
7445857 if they are only showing you two or three photos alarm bells should start ringing
7445858 you need to see whole wedding days its easy to take five or six hundred photos and fluke two or three not so easy to get three or four hundred great photos out of six hundred
7445859 some photographers wont release the images some wont release for a while some release immediately theres no firm set rule there

7445901 are you willing to crash into a family of 4 for damn dog
7445902 when people are cheering about a drop in gas prices to just below 4 a gallon something is fundamentally wrong with our nations approach to safely affordably and reliably meeting our energy demands we must act to relieve the burden of high costs in the present and we must better prepare for the future passing an extension of federal renewable energy and energy efficiency tax credits is at the top of the list for me it is past time for our government to do more to spur investment in clean energy to complement and catalyze the growing interest and willingness of the private sector in this critical new industry
7445903 not to the best of my recollection but there is material being gathered by the department about the child concerned so there may well be something that i dont recall but as youll appreciate it is a long time ago she said
7445904 i think it would be wrong of me because its very complex human issues that are involved in this she said

7445965 very few health programs save more than they cost but the ntc did she said

7445969 if there is a substantive change we need to do a revisit but we havent been able to reach them
7445970 if its not ready we have a provisional place to go for a couple weeks but i dont think it will come to that
7445971 they have a bias against private schools theyre making us go the extra mile
7445972 we are supportive if they can get affairs in order
7445973 i dont know whether any of the individual states are doing a very good job of tackling it on their own
7445974 i think young girls are being forced to marry older men and i think that is rape
7445975 this seems to be crossing state lines and to be more than the states know what to do with
7445976 people cannot pick and choose which laws they want to abide by
7445977 are not doing a very good job of it you can go to any town in this state and find polygamists
7445978 if polygamists are working hard holding down jobs as far as im concerned we ought to leave them alone
7445979 the states and local governments are better able to understand those issues and separate out what really needs to be dealt with and what can be let go
7445980 i dont agree with the practice of polygamy but whether the federal government should go in
7445981 i just get concerned about how much power the government has
7445982 a comprehensive federal response should minimize if not eliminate the possibility that persons within the flds who may be predisposed to commit polygamy or other crimes will simply move their operations to another location
7445983 i am still waiting for a response to that request
7445984 its a situation where teachers were about to lose their jobs

7446003 our drugs always disappear from the stores yet they are not broken into who do you suspect to be the thieves if they are not our own staff
7446004 review what youve spent in the last month and multiply that by three or by six or whatever you feel gives you the most security
7446005 this is especially true if its a second marriage and there are children from the first marriage
7446006 you will want to safeguard some of the assets for the children
7446007 especially with older couples its not uncommon for one partner to look after all the financial affairs
7446008 so its important that both parties take an active role in the family finances or you could be caught off guard
7446009 the project was inspired by a collectively felt desire for regular collaboration between musicians and visual artists

7446014 you have to be able to think on your feet and always be on the lookout for an opportunity to make a visitors experience something they are going to talk about when they go home
7446015 its not about going for a drive and being able to see lovely scenery its about going to the beach and being able to try surfing for the first time or visiting citadel hill and seeing a re enactment of a soldiers life
7446016 its about making sure your customer has the bragging rights around the water cooler when they get back to the office
7446017 the demand is greater than what we can accommodate in halifax thats why we need a new metro centre she said
7446018 its always very hard to play a big side but we have to get maximum points if we are to catch up with the rest of the pack and i am sure we can match them if we get down to real business
7446019 these kinds of meetings and exchanges happen all the time
7446020 the agenda included domestic and international climate change policy low carbon fuels and biofuels
7446021 the minister took their views into consideration the government is proceeding with its turning the corner plan
7446022 besigye wants to turn miria obote into his campaign agent for lango region
7446023 we shall not allow this to happen i will fight it till the end
7446024 we shall make sure that we field a single candidate
7446025 the way of doing this is simple we may decide to have various primaries among ourselves to determine our strength so that we come up with one person to challenge the nrm candidate
7446026 when we talk of inter party cooperation people think that it is besigyes plan to get support of other opposition parties that is not true parties can still operate as independent entities
7446027 we have agreed to continue with our work plan of creating a good atmosphere before 2011 and develop a roadmap to victory
7446028 we shall nurture and adopt a new language which can foster mutual respect between the co operating parties
7446029 if we are to build a multi party system then we should allow young parties to grow and this can only happen by building structures how can parties build structures with out presidential candidates
7446030 we in upc think it is too early to begin discussing a single candidate strategy and i think it may not work
7446031 we fdc can not swallow other parties because its not our intention
7446032 even the protocol which we signed cannot allow us to merge because it permits all parties to operate as independent entities
7446033 we have not yet reached at a single candidate strategy the steering committee which was put in place will work on some modalities of the co operation if a single candidate comes up we shall weigh its pros and cons
7446034 to explore possibilities of adopting a common electoral platform for the 2011 general elections
7446035 not even business i have never dealt with that man
7446036 there is the perception out there because of the bad news stories that we are not open for business and that is not accurate
7446037 we have multiple industrial sites within industrial parks we have land we have a workforce we have good access to education and we have access to the port of saint john
7446038 this is a long term process we have to retool our workforce with the drop in fishing and forestry
7446039 and there is a lot of effort in actively looking for a model to follow to improve our area
7446040 what we are doing at this juncture is talking to big box stores
7446041 instead of dropping containers in halifax or moncton and distributing them from there it may be more feasible to drop containers in saint john use the ferry and distribute product from here we have the warehouse space now that could be used
7446042 that will require fabrication and those kinds of things and we have a number of companies on this side that could benefit
7446043 from the saint john board of trade view one of the things we want to do is work more with chambers in our region and that includes the digby board of trade
7446044 to come to saint john and meet our directors and talk about the opportunities and show them first hand what is going on in our region
7446045 so that may be an opportunity for the folks in the digby annapolis valley area there may be people with skills there that could benefit from what is going on in saint john
7446046 we tell business we are open for business and it is as much a pr exercise as it is a co ordination exercise
7446047 its not flashy its long slow painful plodding work and its kind of sad if people think there is an instant fix
7446048 when they first closed the base and acoa was running it it didnt work
7446049 the local community took over and it became very successful there is a lot of industry there
7446050 we are seeking an appointment with the minister for justice on wednesday morning to formally present the petition to the government
7446051 it will be a special meeting and the sole agenda shall be the cj
7446052 these kinds of meetings and exchanges happen all the time
7446053 the agenda included domestic and international climate change policy low carbon fuels and biofuels
7446054 the minister took their views into consideration the government is proceeding with its turning the corner plan
7446055 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
7446056 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va

7446058 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7446059 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
7446060 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
7446061 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
7446062 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7446063 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7446064 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7446065 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
7446066 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
7446067 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
7446068 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
7446069 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
7446070 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
7446071 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
7446072 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
7446073 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
7446074 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
7446075 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
7446076 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
7446077 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
7446078 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
7446079 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
7446080 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
7446081 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
7446082 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
7446083 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
7446084 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
7446085 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
7446086 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
7446087 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
7446088 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
7446089 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
7446090 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
7446091 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
7446092 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
7446093 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
7446094 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
7446095 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
7446096 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
7446097 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
7446098 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
7446099 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7446100 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
7446101 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
7446102 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
7446103 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
7446104 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
7446105 this is what floridas communities need right now the money and reassurance that assistance is on the way fay is leaving a lot of debris in her wake and expediting removal helps keep the public safe
7446106 no matter the conflict members of our armed forces answer the call rise to the challenge and make tremendous sacrifices on behalf of a grateful nation
7446107 as an immigrant to america i have been the beneficiary of those who sacrificed so that i might have the opportunity to live in freedom having lived in oppression i can assure you that freedom is a valued gift and i thank you for your service in the cause of freedom
7446108 access to quality health care is a right everyone who has worn our nations uniform deserves
7446109 i am happy to say that this long overdue dream of so many central florida veterans is finally moving forward we have secured the property the plans are in the works and its only a matter of time before a new hospital comes online and begins serving area veterans
7446110 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
7446111 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
7446112 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
7446113 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
7446114 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
7446115 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
7446116 what i dont want is for the best to be the enemy of the good
7446117 if we can come up with a genuine bipartisan compromise in which i have to accept some things i dont like and the democrats have to accept some things they dont like when its actually moving us in the direction of energy independence im open to that
7446118 what i will not do is support a plan that suggests that drilling is the answer to our energy problems
7446119 no one really knows where barack obama is on the issues these days
7446120 what we do know is that hes spent months attacking john mccains common sense plans to increase domestic production so anything he says should be taken with a grain of salt hell probably try to refine his stands a few more times before november if it is in his political interest
7446121 the one thing that ive said consistently when it comes to the florida coastline is that as dependent as this state is on tourism as important as that coastline is weve got to proceed with extreme caution when it comes to anything that has an impact on that extraordinary treasure
7446122 to help formulate this vision im going to re establish the national aeronautics and space council so that we can develop a plan to explore the solar system a plan that involves both human and robotic missions and enlists both international partners and the private sector and as america leads the world to long term exploration of the moon and mars and beyond lets also tap nasas ingenuity to build the airplanes of tomorrow and to study our own planet so we can combat global climate change under my watch nasa will inspire the world once again
7446123 in no way do i think that john mccains campaign is being racist i think theyre being cynical
7446124 i think they want to distract people from talking about real issues
7446125 and government cant and shouldnt do for us what we can do for united states senate 356 russell senate office building washington dc 20510
7446126 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
7446127 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
7446128 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent

7446138 the silver medal is unexpected we are so happy that we made the breakthrough for chinese rhythmic gymnastics its the most glorious moment for chinese rhythmic gymnastics
7446139 its not easy because we have come a long way to be here we will make efforts for better results in the future
7446140 we cried a lot today because its not easy for us to get the silver most of us have injuries and we just held on we hope todays win will bring more chinese girls to the sport
7446141 we just wanted to do our best we were not the pre game favourite and so we placed ourselves in a lower position we were fighting for better results not the medal
7446142 our strong point is the difficulty of our routines and the weak point is artistry we trained a lot in the past two months to improve artistry and the efforts paid off
7446143 we are overwhelmed with emotion it took a lot of training and its been a long road we are yet to fully comprehend this victory
7446144 on the one hand our group is developing and on the other hand more and more countries are joining the olympic movement so the competition is improving
7446145 i really really feel upset we did not live up to our expectations
7446146 still some democrats worry that bidens flapping tongue could cause p
7446147 would not be deliberate it would not be that he stopped being a team player and decided to go out and conduct foreign policy on his own it would be just that he was out there and talking
7446148 seems to me this would be a good time to send no strings attached a check for 200 million to iran
7446149 the thing i would worry about is that it would almost look like a publicity stunt
7446150 even if iran was a full democracy like india it would want nuclear capability like india
7446151 what the world needed to address was irans emotional needs
7446152 senator joseph biden said that even if iran was a full democracy like india it would want nuclear capability like india what the world needed to address was irans emotional needs he said with a nonaggression pact
7446153 stressed the importance of iran and the role which it can play in the sensitive and volatile region
7446154 he hoped the existing problems between the islamic republic of iran and america would be removed someday
7446155 kharrazi in turn said the iranian nation has suffered gravely from the antagonistic steps of the american government
7446156 i hope were all smarter about this smarter than weve been
7446157 i hope our leadership is brighter because if its not its a very dull picture for the region and for humanity
7446158 getting the chairman of the senate foreign relations committee to appear at this event will certainly be seen by the regime in tehran as a show of support

7446164 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7446165 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time

7446198 statt statistiken zu vergleichen m ssen politik und wirtschaft dieses problem in angriff nehmen und lehrstellen schaffen
7446199 fest und au er diskussion steht dass erneut tausende jugendliche im herbst ohne ausbildungsplatz dastehen hier muss so schnell wie m glich angesetzt werden
7446200 ein sehr positiver impuls angesichts der vielen unternehmen die zwar nach facharbeiterinnen rufen aber keine lehrlinge aufnehmen wien ist anders die stadt und die wiener stadtwerke bilden weit ber den eigenen bedarf hinaus aus und erm glichen jugendlichen so einen start ins berufsleben
7446201 daran m ssen wir arbeiten denn es wird f r die meisterschaft entscheidend sein
7446202 die konstanz ist also der schl ssel zur meisterschaft und dazu z hlen die leistung die zuverl ssigkeit und auch die fahrer all das wird bis zum saisonende sehr wichtig sein
7446203 heute haben wir zwei seiten der medaille gesehen wir verf gen ber ein gro artiges potenzial sowohl vom team als auch vom auto sind in der lage uns vor allen zu platzieren aber wenn nicht alle elemente optimal funktionieren werfen wir wertvolle punkte weg die uns teuer zu stehen kommen

7446205 nach einem tag wie diesen gibt es nicht sonderlich viel zu sagen
7446206 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
7446207 its finding good quantities of capital at good interest rates
7446208 with the internet and vast array of research information available starting up is much easier and significantly less costly this allows us to push profits right away and to establish a solid presence in the gaming website design field quickly
7446209 and they took it very seriously confidentiality especially in the gaming website design market is of core important and these students were able to finish a great analysis without duress
7446210 but we have a strong relationship with our top investors and they know the gaming website design field very well as a result no one gets gun shy or cold feet
7446211 but its really no different than the enigma of day trading or forex people are not necessarily afraid of investment process but merely of the high risk involved
7446212 its better to look through the mid range gaming website design companies for ones with strong growth potential
7446213 its a shame that our industry isnt seen as more main stream
7446214 if more main stream investors got involved through good brokerages wed see a higher division of risk across the board this is especially important in our business model because if we rely on one or two large investment firms they can end up constantly twisting our elbows
7446215 i always tell my gaming website design clients to wait at minimum 18 months before evaluating the success of a particular investment
7446216 that way those who get jittery early on allow themselves a chance to see the investment through
7446217 weve seen more people getting into investing and more company executives doing more aggressive marketing and sales with the knowledge that they are backed by a diverse number of share holders
7446218 fussball ist mehr als nur ein sport fussball ist euphorie religion und droge zugleich
7446219 if you polled the average guy on the street who knew anything about buyouts theyd say oh my gosh bell is going to stop investing the neat thing about this announcement is that thats absolutely not the case

7446225 you need to find a job where they will take you on as you are
7446226 sometimes you have to tell the boss the truth sometimes thats good
7446227 other times they can take advantage of you and pay you less
7446228 we dont see a lot of americans wanting to come and take these positions
7446229 these people didnt take the jobs they were jobs americans didnt want to take
7446230 the concept of making employers into policemen and putting a wedge between employers and employees is nonsense
7446231 the employer wants to protect the workforce the department of homeland security wants to deport the workforce
7446232 it is very expensive if they came down and cited us for having undocumented employees its jail terms
7446233 the financial risk is enormous until we decide its important to educate our children and give them vocational skills these people are the only ones that are coming able to do this work

7446236 we believe the z750 is such a compelling offer because not only will it be one of the best looking clamshells on the market but it also provides the tools or applications which really let you get the most from these broadband speeds
7446237 sony ericsson is continuing to deliver on the promise of the marriage of sony and ericsson with iconic products such as the z750 says najmi jarwala president sony ericsson mobile communications usa inc there is no question that hsdpa is critical for north american gsm operators and we believe products like the z750 will entice the mass market to tap into everything these faster networks enable consumers to do while on the move
7446238 you can take the hardest rock band on the earth and they sound like a bunch of girls next to the dubliners
7446239 the word twat was used in context it was meant to be a nasty word on purpose because this is a nasty character
7446240 however jacqueline doesnt want to offend her readers or her readers parents so when the book comes to be reprinted the word will be replaced with twit
7446241 everyone was polite and seemed interested but no one offered to raise money to build her
7446242 it is only two games if it was the last games of the season maybe there would be pressure but now no
7446243 i think teams have time now to lose some points
7446244 i understand that we didnt play like last week but i also understand the reasons why
7446245 wigan played better than portsmouth they pressured us and they were playing at home the people can help more than they can when we are at stamford bridge
7446246 also i have had many problems this week michael ballack played with a little injury michael essien has not been training for 10 days then trains for two and i needed him to play 90 minutes and mikel john obi is out
7446247 but they fought and it was possible to win the game it is fantastic for chelsea and fantastic for our group because we have confidence and we have six points
7446248 in my eyes yes we did enough i think most people who witnessed it would say that too
7446249 but they have given everything when you play these big teams sometimes you have to ride your luck we didnt have to do that because we played well against them
7446250 when you analyse it our goalkeeper didnt have a save to make thats almost unheard of against chelsea and they will go away thinking we nicked that one
7446251 i have a lot of respect for crouch and defoe
7446252 they are good players and will score a lot of goals this year especially at home
7446253 crouch is tall and wins most things in the air and defoe is very quick around the box he is a sharp player who makes problems for defenders
7446254 but as defenders we are here to deal with situations like that
7446255 we know who we are playing against so we need to prepare properly because it is very important we get the three points
7446256 we have started badly but it is a long season and we have plenty of time to put it right
7446257 it will not be easy portsmouth will want to show they are not as bad as they looked last week but we will be ready
7446258 i am not saying portsmouth are bad but when it is one of the top teams the community shield is like a derby and you really want to win
7446259 with a brilliant smile and the early facial creases of happy dissipation he was known for being cranky curious passive aggressive and most of all persnickety

7446273 my teammates were amazing today but i just wish that my performance was a little better
7446274 weve overcome so many obstacles but we came out here today and showed the world and every team out here that we can come back strong
7446275 its been a really long road and im just so proud to be here
7446276 im honored to be representing the u s a i had a great meet today and finishing on floor was probably my favorite moment because i knew id given it my all
7446277 my goal was to come out and know that at the end of the competition id have no regrets
7446278 i definitely have no regrets im happy with how everything went and to say that you have an olympic medal is just amazing

7446320 i just woke up before 5am and i had the spasm in my neck it was quite a big problem which nearly led to me not racing this weekend
7446321 it was so bad i was struggling to stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers pedro de la rosa was looking forward to racing
7446322 fortunately ive got a great doctor who was with the whole way through it its still sore it was probably something to do with my pillow the way i was sleeping
7446323 these lads have taken a lot of punishment from kerry over the last number of years counihan said shortly after the full time whistle on sunday
7446324 there were times out there when they were on top of us that we could have folded up the tent and capitulated again but we display tremendous character in not throwing in the towel and that has to count for something
7446325 once we have that in the tank there is always a possibility of winning and that keeps players going
7446326 the reality of the situation from my point of view is that some of our players under performed again out there today and its something well have to address before the replay we have room for improvement and the players will know that themselves
7446327 i have to admit that we were fortunate enough to get the draw we didnt play well on the day i recall saying to the selectors when we were six points down and two minutes left to play that we needed two goals if were to extricate ourselves out of this game
7446328 listening to the liverpool match against middlesbrough on saturday id be a bit of a fan they needed two goals if they were to win the game late and they got them
7446329 i remember saying to one of the lads that that is a sign of a team that is mentally strong the team that gets one goal back rises a bit while the opposition becomes a bit rattled
7446330 similarly thats what happened here james got a goal and then we pushed on looking for another and that came from a penalty so as long as there is time left there is hope setanta readers comment of the day

7446341 this seems to be crossing state lines and to be more than the states know what to do with
7446342 people cannot pick and choose which laws they want to abide by
7446343 are not doing a very good job of it you can go to any town in this state and find polygamists
7446344 if polygamists are working hard holding down jobs as far as im concerned we ought to leave them alone
7446345 the states and local governments are better able to understand those issues and separate out what really needs to be dealt with and what can be let go
7446346 i dont agree with the practice of polygamy but whether the federal government should go in
7446347 i just get concerned about how much power the government has
7446348 a comprehensive federal response should minimize if not eliminate the possibility that persons within the flds who may be predisposed to commit polygamy or other crimes will simply move their operations to another location
7446349 i am still waiting for a response to that request

7446351 truly they are genuinely interested in serving their members and are not fighting for selfish interest
7446352 it is a pity that the federal government has never planned anything good for the niger delta people
7446353 it is this so called project that will either unite us with the federal government or tear us apart again
7446354 both ijaw itsekiri isoko and youths from other ethnic group in the region will be strongly united to fight this evil to a stand still because we now realize that the federal government does not mean well for the people of the niger delta
7446355 government should ensure that the same pipeline they used in siphoning our oil and gas to the north should be used to bring in clean water to the niger delta this inhuman act and criminal marginalization must stop forthwith
7446356 misguided sycophants who pretend to be loyalists of governor oserhiemen osunbor
7446357 as far as the party is concerned in the state there is no such move or ploy to impeach the governor as there was no meeting either openly or secretly where such suggestions or moves were made rather the party is embarking on massive registration of new entrants into its fold in edo state

7446381 de las actuaciones administrativas que aquel el stj de rn tom en cuenta para fundar esa decisi n de negar la instancia judicial entendiendo que no se hab a agotado la v a administrativa surge la conclusi n diametralmente opuesta

7446385 hemos debido salir varias veces de nuestras casas junto a nuestras familias y ni os ya que en los allanamientos la polic a act a violentamente y nos golpean injustificadamente sin respetar a nadie
7446386 no nos cargen a nosotros que somos los mapuches buenos acciones de otros que son los mapuche malos

7446388 la gran mayor a de las comunidades desea el d alogo
7446389 se habla de interculturalidad pero no se garantiza el derecho al idioma y a la historia de los pueblos originarios
7446390 el sistema debe reconocer y valorar al individuo en su especificidad cultural y de origen considerando su lengua cosmovisi n e historia en un di logo arm nico entre las distintas sociedades que confluyen y conviven en la naci n chilena
7446391 chile se apronta a celebrar 200 a os de vida republicana y no creo muy plausible que en esta ley de educaci n no estemos incluidos si no se cambien las leyes sectoriales las diferencias entre los pueblos originarios y los chilenos seguir n existiendo
7446392 esta es una de las ltimas audiencias p blicas que tendr la comisi n de educaci n que tiene presupuestado votar en general la iniciativa la primera semana de septiembre
7446393 la direcci n regional de la comisi n nacional del medio ambiente conama ais n ha declarado admisible al sistema de evaluaci n de impacto ambiental seia el estudio de impacto ambiental del
7446394 este proceso tiene como objetivo central resguardar el derecho de las personas naturales y jur dicas que puedan sentirse afectadas a hacer las observaciones ambientales que estimen pertinentes enriqueciendo la evaluaci n y d ndole a la autoridad mayores herramientas para resolver al respecto
7446395 la situaci n que afecta a las familias de nuestras comunidades lafkenche y pescadores artesanales que no han negociado con celco es producto de una pol tica que ha desarrollado el estado chileno para salvaguardar los intereses de privados por sobre los derechos humanos consagrados en la carta de las naciones unidas y en todos los pactos firmados por chile como el convenio 169 de la o i t o la declaraci n de las naciones unidas para los derechos de los pueblos ind genas
7446396 la ci nega se ha secado el agua est sucia cuando toman el agua los animales se mueren
7446397 es por ello que el gobierno junto con hacerse parte en lo procesos judiciales para aclarar los hechos debe trabajar m s activamente en la soluci n de las hist ricas y presentes demandas sociales particularmente sobre las tierras mapuche
7446398 manifestamos nuestra condena categ rica a este hecho de violencia y esperamos que se realice una investigaci n acuciosa transparente y con pleno respeto a los derechos humanos para determinar qui nes fueron sus responsables
7446399 no obstante hacemos un llamado a no estigmatizar al pueblo mapuche a ra z de este hecho como lo han manifestado algunas autoridades y exigimos que estos lamentables sucesos no constituyan una nueva carta blanca para continuar con la pol tica gubernamental de criminalizar las protestas y reivindicaciones mapuches que ha terminado en violentos procedimientos policiales con saldos de personas heridas y muertas
7446400 viven preocupados del transantiago y no hacen nada con el transmapuche
7446401 esto es un hecho que calificamos como grave inaceptable y lo que corresponde en un estado de derecho es que el ministerio p blico siga adelante con la persecuci n tal como lo ha hecho hasta ahora cuando hay conversaciones destinadas a mejorar las condiciones de tranquilidad del sector que se ha aludido obviamente representa un retroceso no obstante que nosotros no podemos imputar responsabilidad a ning n grupo por el minuto m s all del comunicado que se adjudica este atentado
7446402 en este caso se hab an adoptado medidas que estaban dando muy buenos resultados dos fiscales con dedicaci n exclusiva coordinados por un fiscal regional eso se va a mantener e incrementar si bien ha habido algunos resultados esto es un retroceso estamos a la espera de los detalles del atentado pero la se al clara es que no se va a tolerar ninguna impunidad por el contrario se va a ser a n m s severo en la persecuci n de los il citos
7446403 bajo ese aspecto ya han sido condenados varios hermanos y el gobierno de michelle bachelet contin a con esta tendencia de estigmatizar el conflicto mapuche bajo supuestos delitos que nunca han sido ver dicamente determinados como realizados por mapuches s lo se testimonia la presencia de encapuchados que no se sabe cu l es su procedencia y de inmediato se incrimina a los hermanos de las comunidades como en este caso de la cam
7446404 me llama la atenci n la premura con que el gobierno declara ya qui nes son los culpables que la sociedad nacional de agricultura declare qui nes son los culpables es un sistema que viene aplic ndose desde hace tiempo en definitiva yo creo que es una estigmatizaci n de las organizaciones mapuches y con esto busca desestimar una leg tima demanda territorial cultural y pol tica
7446405 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7446406 es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos en circunstancias de que estaba realizando su labor profesional
7446407 el procedimiento policial fue adoptado conforme a la legislaci n vigente
7446408 entonces vemos ac una incongruencia entre las prerrogativas que carabineros cree tener para ejercer su labor y lo que el ministerio p blico se ala ya que en ltima instancia la fiscal a se desiste del procedimiento toda vez que no encuentra m ritos suficientes para seguir con la causa
7446409 como colegio creemos que es importante que la ciudadan a conozca el resultado de esta investigaci n donde se establece que nuestro colega fue detenido sin m ritos arbitraria e ilegalmente en circunstancias que estaba realizando su labor profesional ser a muy relevante que carabineros reconozca de una vez por todas el error en el procedimiento considerando que la ciudadan a cada d a est m s atenta al actuar de los organismos p blicos
7446410 por eso entendemos que el gobierno quiera impulsar la tipificaci n penal de las agresiones que sufran los profesionales de la prensa en el cumplimiento de sus labores informativas a la luz de diversas situaciones que han vivido los colegas en el ltimo tiempo como el caso del fot grafo de efe v ctor salas quien result herido en el ojo derecho al ser agredido meses atr s por un agente antidisturbios de carabineros

7446415 extra o hecho delictual donde los malhechores no roban nada y lo que parecieran visibilizar m s bien son consignas
7446416 quien no entiende a la buena entender con toda la fuerza del derecho
7446417 estamos ante un hecho delictual y perseguiremos crimin lmente a los responsables
7446418 seremos m s severos en la represi n no se va a tolerar ning n tipo de impunidad

7446425 que viera gallo tranquilice a la derecha asegur ndoles que de ning n modo lo ser
7446426 el reconocimiento de los errores en estas materias es sin lugar a dudas excepcional por ello un informe sobre violaciones a los derechos humanos es demasiado importante para la calidad de la democracia su objetivo no es agradar sino incomodar su metodolog a no es la misma utilizada en informes de avance o implementaci n de pol ticas p blicas o legislaci n su vocaci n no es el compromiso entre los intereses en juego sino la f rrea defensa de aquello que m s valoramos cuando nos enfrentamos al poder o la ausencia del mismo

7446474 mukhang gustong sairin ng gobyernong arroyo ang aming pera hindi pa nakuntento sa bilyong dolyar na halaga ng remitans na ginagamit para sagipin ang ekonomiya ng bansa ginagamit naman nito ngayon ang mga cash transfer firm para makakuha pa ng dagdag na buwis sa mga ofw sa anyo ng 0 15 dst
7446475 habang ang gobyerno at malalaking negosyo ay nagkakamal ng dambuhalang tubo halos wala namang natitira sa mga ofw ang 200 buwanang remitans na ipinadadala namin sa aming pamilya ay lalong lumiliit ang halaga dahil sa patuloy na pagtaas ng mga bilihin at serbisyo
7446476 sa halip na tugunan ang panawagan naming alisin ang mga bayarin sa remitans ang tanging sagot ng administrasyong arroyo ay pag aaralan pa ang dapat ay alisin ang mga bayaring ito na sumisipsip sa dugo pawis at luha naming mga ofw

7446526 the problem is that our government believes it is entitled to its citizens personal information
7446527 and thats not the way this country was set up
7446528 if we were to judge these programs and their expenditure of resources by their effectiveness youd see a lot of them go by the wayside
7446529 nevertheless efforts to harmonize the rules governing criminal and national security matters also raise potential civil liberties concerns given the broader latitude currently given to investigators to consider race and ethnicity in national security matters

7446533 its probably about time investors come to property firmsthrough actions like capital injections with the mid tolong term view that their shares have plunged too far and mayhave nearly bottomed
7446534 still a rebound in property shares wont happen overnightand financial institutions are not likely to change theirstance

7446549 he gave them wrong information and they bombed us all and spared nobody
7446550 we regret the loss of life among the innocent afghanis who we are committed to protect coalition forces take precautions to prevent the loss of civilians unlike the taliban and militants who target civilians and place civilians in harms way
7446551 we will continue our demonstration till the international community listens to us and bring those who carried out yesterdays attack to justice
7446552 people didnt accept the aid and started throwing stones at the soldiers saying the afghan army is our enemy we dont want anything from our enemies
7446553 its about how to run a campaign about saving water ive got to advise and then judge which team is the best which i will hate

7446556 over the next 100 years the shape of our coastline will change and our favourite seaside destinations may not look the way they were captured in our holiday snapshots
7446557 i think we have a natural affinity with our coast and the sea but we all need to be aware that our environment is not fixed and that change is inevitable
7446558 there are still lots of doubts about obama we just dont know him
7446559 we need to see something from obama we want to leave unified
7446560 john mccain says we might stay in iraq for 100 years many latinos are being injured and killed in iraq latino senior citizens and latino veterans will see that they are better off with obama he will win the latino vote decisively
7446561 as much as id like to believe what pena says its just not true
7446562 there is a severe split in the party the obama people are just not doing enough
7446563 ive met folks from the ba609 team and the v 22 team and were working well together i find a lot of good people in those teams that have accepted me with open arms
7446564 relatively pleased with the way things were going and not focusing on how much better they could be
7446565 what were looking for is technology that increases the safety and efficiencies of the customers aircraft in completing the mission
7446566 theyre buying time until they can introduce all new helicopters
7446567 you have to anticipate what customers would like if he knew what you could do
7446568 what are the compelling reasons your customer will say yes they got it right
7446569 ill contend to some extent those crew errors can be solved with existing technologies as we make the job easier for the crew
7446570 but to the extent you design the airplane so that they cant make mistakes you can make them a lot safer
7446571 hes a smart fellow i think he could be a real asset to bell
7446572 i want to reintroduce this organization to the thrills of being competitive and winning
7446573 im a pretty impatient person we often ask for things to be done in years when we can make progress in months
7446574 tilt rotors carry half as much just as far 50 percent faster at twice the cost of an equivalent helicopter
7446575 anything i published or said was based on fact those facts represent the capabilities of helicopters tilt rotors and other vstol aircraft in as fair a manner as i know how to do what i think the test of time has shown is the stuff i said was correct
7446576 and i have said tilt rotors will as a class serve to be safe and effective the v 22 has certainly proven to be that
7446577 i just wanted to tell her were excited and also anything you see that we need to be doing or should be doing speak up dont hesitate because we want to get this right
7446578 but michelle and i spent some time together this morning and were really looking forward to being together
7446579 if you think those guys have chemistry i think we have chemistry
7446580 i see a historic moment i have goosebumps when i think of what these two can do for the country
7446581 inflammation is a major factor in a number of chronic diseases affecting millions of people and can cause an unwanted impact on healthy tissue
7446582 past research has shown that the probiotic bifidobacterium infantis 35624 can positively impact the bodys immune defence and this most recent data suggests that its benefits are not restricted to the gastrointestinal tract
7446583 it was typical michael he just threw himself at the ball without any thought for himself he was in extreme agony

7446585 just 52 percent of self identifying clinton supporters say they are backing obama while 21 percent are siding with john mccain and 27 percent are undecided or are looking for some other candidate to support

7446587 do you really think nuns are all elderly straitlaced and funereal
7446588 its no longer that way these days there are nuns from africa and latin america who are really very very lovely the brazilians particularly
7446589 the college fears that appropriate people may not be given it inappropriate people may be given it and the side effects may not be managed appropriately
7446590 and overall far more people will be given it which increases the risk of pregnancies especially if this is not properly screened for and then theres more abortions
7446591 we go from house to house to ask mothers to send their children and to use the facilities provided by the centre along with the pre school education and supplementary nutrition we also provide health care facility to the children and mothers free medicines and immunization are also provided the local people and the administration help us to achieve our targets
7446592 in tripura the icds is working for the upliftment of the tribal children and women
7446593 we not only send our children to this centre but come here for medical checkup and food which is given free of cost its a great help for poor people like us
7446594 at this centre our children get pre school education along with training and information about health here pregnant women and nursing mothers are provided free services like supplementary nutrition health check up and immunization to improve the nutritional and health status of children up to six years of age
7446595 children are pillars of the nation and if the militants keep doing these evil activities they will ruin the childrens life it will not bring any good to the nation

7446597 the activities of militants have hampered development its because of them the people of manipur are suffering
7446598 in future i would like to see manipur to be very developed
7446599 the virtual system encourages patients to walk more quickly and for longer almost without them realising it its not just that theyre distracted from the pain by moving faster than they realise their body actually feels it less were effectively fooling the brain and cheating the body
7446600 its a lot more fun than traditional rehab and it can actually facilitate a much faster recovery our test subjects are usually surprised when i tell them theyve improved by up to 20 per cent
7446601 the vast majority of stroke survivors cannot use a normal treadmill because they are not in control many can only hold on with one hand making it almost impossible walking is the best possible exercise for their bodies and this system means it could all become available to them

7446605 rain clouds from hebei and inner mongolia had started to move towards the capital city at 2 p m
7446606 moisture in the air was at a higher level than at the time before the opening ceremony and would more easily develop into convective clouds
7446607 we decided to use planes to cover a larger area along with firing rain dispersal rockets from the ground
7446608 i think pam needs to come clean as the video speaks for itself and that is evidence that a person cannot deny news com au quoted lazenbys longtime friend and spokesman michael sands as saying

7446610 in ziua de 22 august dupa o supraveghere operativa derulata pe parcursul a trei zile politistii de frontiera mehedinteni cu sprijinul colegilor din cadrul ijpf timis l au prins in flagrant pe traficant la punctul de trecere a frontierei cenad acesta intentiona sa iasa din tara cu autoturismul personal insotit de alte trei tinere cu varste cuprinse intre 14 si 22 ani pe care urma sa le duca in germania in acelasi scop pentru practicarea prostitutiei
7446611 we cant presume anything but we believe he was fascinated with water it was on his mind we dont know how why or what drew him to the water
7446612 he was stumbling around the bar skipping like a kid and dancing he was totally gone having a whale of a time gazza and rex were arm in arm both on drugs and knocking back drinks just letting go
7446613 we noticed gazza sat a few tables away on his own just sitting there drinking and mumbling to himself he looked completely lost
7446614 rex loves to kick off a party and as soon as he saw gazza he got him involved it was almost like a game to him he wanted to see if gazza would do a few lines with us it turned into a very heavy night
7446615 he was stumbling around sometimes singing along sometimes trying to talk to people
7446616 ultimately we look forward to a debate between joe biden and barack obama about whether obama has the judgment and experience to lead
7446617 the choice on iraq in this election is clear and compelling
7446618 joe biden believes the war was a mistake mccain would still do it all over again biden knows the bush mccain policy has weakened our hand fighting terrorism and finding osama bin laden
7446619 john mccain started beating the drums for war after september 11th and wants to double down on the bush policy for four more years if barack obama and joe biden had set iraq policy these last six years rather than george bush and john mccain we wouldnt be in the hole were in today

7446621 this discovery enables us to offer the first genetic tests to families affected by the inherited form of this disease
7446622 furthermore because there already are drugs in development that target the same gene in adult cancers we can soon begin testing those drugs in children with neuroblastoma
7446623 as we increase our knowledge of alk mutations we will also offer specialized diagnostic testing for all newly diagnosed patients with neuroblastoma to eventually allow oncologists to better customize treatment to a childs genetic profile
7446624 we thought it would be a captive caiman which had escaped or been abandoned then killed and eaten a wild bird and was laying on the grass digesting it
7446625 she won millions of votes but isnt on his ticket why for speaking the truth
7446626 we still dont have a lot of answers about senator obama
7446627 theres going to be a lot of rhetoric coming out of the convention but we want to match that with barack obamas record and tell people hes not ready to be president
7446628 senator obama has made a choice more out of weakness than strength
7446629 the strong choice would have been hillary clinton the obvious choice would have been hillary clinton she had 50 percent of the democratic vote obama has 50 per cent of the democratic vote you almost have to go to extraordinary lengths to avoid her as the vice presidential pick of the party
7446630 theres a lot of hillary supporters that are concerned that obama doesnt have the experience necessary to be commander in chief and we are going to be very aggressive in reaching out to them
7446631 it was the perfect week the perfect races couldnt ask for anything else
7446632 hard to imagine but this is a great start its going to be amazing im kind of at a loss for words because i was like oh you know i wonder how many people are going to be there im staring down this street of people just packed together its one of the coolest things ive ever experienced
7446633 despite the increasing number of commuters and passengers the public transport operators especially prasarana has failed miserably to meet the demands of the passengers
7446634 for the past one month there are numerous reports of breakdowns on the two lrt systems not to mention the many unexpected delays in bus services
7446635 i wonder what the mbpj has to do with the breakdowns why does an elected representative has to turn to mbpj to convey the message of the people to the management of rapidkl
7446636 they gave people only about 10 days notice we are questioning the short notice given and why a route t522 from usj 8 to subang parade has been cancelled without consulting the people
7446637 its unfair for rapidkl to make these decisions we hope rapidkl can be more considerate to the people
7446638 it is generally assumed that public transport users are people from the lower income group who have no other choice
7446639 theres not much you can do if the driver doesnt follow the route if you complain he will yell at you or hell say if you dont like it buy a car
7446640 it does not give a positive image of public transportation
7446641 if he wants to see how bad it is he has to take the bus and wait for it then he will runderstand what public transport is like

7446646 in santa monica it is very difficult to find something that is not marketable
7446647 if youre collecting in single stream you need to be able to separate the materials the equipment used to separate those things may not tolerate hangers clothing or plastic bags
7446648 multi family housing is the hardest to reach out to its hard because there is not a lot of space also because many are gated and its hard to get those trucks through the gates its a very big challenge
7446649 a pesar de las consecuencias de lo que suceder a cuando la gente descubri lo que estaba sucediendo en mi vida
7446650 el lado sexual de boy fue a su vez bastante revelador la gente puede hablar de sexo en un nivel anodino o sobre el sadismo y el masoquismo el cuero y el sexo impulsivo pero todo es en realidad muy conservador no son radicales en twilight un ni o se enfrenta a un hombre que era un homosexual y yo estaba tratando de explicar en la canci n que esta no era la forma en la que fue escrito en el libro me da miedo que los sepas un maestro me dijo por qu me r o cuando los hombres mayores gritan nadie se dio cuenta de que yo estaba hablando de la menopausia se trata de un enigma puedo recordar que se dijo en la escuela acerca de los cambios en la vida y lo angustioso que puede ser para los hombres mayores cuando dejan de funcionar puedo recordar mi risa nerviosa as que en ese lado de boy un mont n de gente no se dio cuenta exactamente qu parte de m mismo estaba dando
7446651 en october me hice m s consciente de la tercera parte de m mismo la naturaleza espiritual y yo pod a haber elegido bloquearla y algunos lo habr an preferido de esa manera pero me permitieron hacerlo gloria trata de expresar ese tipo de cosas una idea en el momento en que una canci n est escrita trato de levantarme pero no puedo encontrar mis pies trato de hablar se trata de la incapacidad de expresarse lo que se traduce en palabras que no se pueden encontrar en ingl s por lo que las palabras en lat n salieron a la luz
7446652 muchos de nuestros contempor neos acaban de expresar un mont n de im genes oscuras y pretenden decir que es profundo pero no existe una verdadera puerta abierta hacia el interior a lo que estaba sucediendo realmente
7446653 he tenido que hacer frente a cuestiones a las que desde hace mucho ten a miedo por ejemplo los problemas en irlanda s lo despu s de estar lejos de casa pod a ver objetivamente qu es exactamente lo que est sucediendo
7446654 si he hablado en contra de los hombres violentos podr a haber tenido un efecto sobre mi vida real hay l neas en las letras que podr an haber dado lugar a un mont n de problemas para el grupo y que fueron omitidas porque no puedo ir en esas condiciones contra los hombres violentos lo que ha sucedido en irlanda es triste e injusto y no hay justificaci n para que el pa s este dividido en dos no hay forma de que puedan ser justificados pero yo todav a creo que no se puede justificar el cambio por la violencia ya que te conviertes en alguien tan culpable como las personas contra quien est s luchando

7446656 our family was poor so we hoped cheng fei could in some way change her life
7446657 so we thought maybe being a professional athlete is good for her
7446658 i think i can do better i wasnt at my best
7446659 she followed me step by step and i shouted to her one two one two
7446660 i cannot believe how hard working she was at that young age
7446661 ive been doing this for 24 years and ive never found a second one like her
7446662 gymnastics is a really painful thing especially for pretty young kids its torture
7446663 so we tell the kids this is your lifetime challenge

7446669 i was a medical technologist and i have gone to school since age whatever 4 or 5 never stopped going even after i got my first college degree and i continued to work full time as well i found that in the medical field my mind was stimulated but not sufficiently where i felt like i was pushing new limits so i furthered my degrees i got an additional masters degree and a phd and every time i learned something more i realized i knew less than what i had hoped to so it just showed me where bald spots were in my education
7446670 i really want to be able to represent people who cant represent themselves and i like being the center of attention so that had something to do with it too a lot of people are very fearful of being in the public eye of speaking in front of a group and thats never been a problem for me so i really felt like because i do feel comfortable in that setting its important for me to step up and do that kind of work
7446671 if we dont continue to learn and expand our horizons as we get older well always be relegated to being the old folks the seniors i think weve got to step up to the plate if were going to live longer weve got to be productive longer or were just going to be filling the nursing homes and not be of any use to ourselves or to anybody else
7446672 we have directed our militants to stop attacks against the government and security forces in bajaur from today the jirga elders council insisted that taliban should stop fighting in the interest of the people of bajaur the jirga has assured the taliban that troops will also suspend shelling and bombing raids in the area we are ready for talks with the government and the truce is an important development towards dialogue
7446673 the final decision about use of aspirin must eventually be made after discussion with a healthcare provider
7446674 we would encourage everyone to examine their own individual risk and take steps to reduce it by adjusting their lifestyle
7446675 with this illness you dont know if you have got it and you can go to sleep and not wake up
7446676 so we are urging people to take care and do whatever they can to make sure that their overseas money is safely invested
7446677 now the criminal has the victims name address and his bank account details to work with from there he can build up the guys whole identity
7446678 what they would also do is sometimes send out a questionnaire directly to the victim they claim its research for the bank or they just want the person to confirm their details and in that way they get a signature
7446679 in one instance we found that a foreign credit card was intercepted in the post they took it and then had an international driving licence made out in that persons name which is deadly because its proof of identity thats all they needed to go and buy a whole bunch of laptops
7446680 the problem now comes when you have to investigate this everything is paper driven and you have to work through diplomatic channels
7446681 there is unfortunately no easy step by step way to stop the fraud completely but by being aware and putting measures in place people are less likely to fall victim
7446682 they have the music and dance tradition of their own
7446683 i am fascinated with india as a country the movie is very much a celebration of india
7446684 to travel to india a place wed never thought wed visit was so amazing
7446685 the people in india were such happy people and always at peace the more you learn about other cultures the more you learn about where you are from
7446686 every time i go back to india i learn a little about myself
7446687 the particular movie is pretty indian in terms of the songs and locations
7446688 it encompasses indian culture and is pretty diverse you have singing and dancing and the story unfolds through song
7446689 that idea would click with children all over the world because its a disney movie its very cultural as well
7446690 but its also a movie about a global village and experiencing culture
7446691 it was so enchanting to be in these monumental structures
7446692 i am really happy they decided to film in india it made it feel more authentic and real when you watch it you almost forget you are watching a movie and you think you are really there
7446693 but they are trying to hold on to family and explore the world
7446694 the thing with the cheetah girls is that they dream and dream big and they never give up they have each other to overcome their obstacles through friendship and support
7446695 by falling in love the prince and the bollywood superstar are all vulnerable just as they are here
7446696 the indian crew members were really proud of what we are doing and they understood we wanted to create a movie to introduce their culture to america and the world
7446697 even in the smallest villages kids are going to school people feel they are improving themselves that is what the cheetah girl s is about experiencing the world
7446698 being a half a world away makes you appreciate other peoples differences
7446699 this movie is going to be seen by about every teen and tween in america
7446700 i have to applaud cheetah girls in taking a chance in casting an indian male as a lead when you present something with an indian leading male and leading female lead they disneys viewers accept it at face value at such an early age now these kids are going to have this seeded into their minds and will expect to see diverse lead roles for the rest of their lives
7446701 this event shows the pipes work and that if you put on great programming that people want to watch then theyll show up
7446702 i dont want to die having spent my life like this having frittered countless hours in traffic
7446703 people are quite upset since those channels are paid by a lot of tax francs to inform us citizens in case of catastrophic events
7446704 vidare r det s att st det missutnyttjas vissa tidningar tar ver konkurrenter egentligen bara f r att f del av deras presst d
7446705 obviously im disturbed by the fact that people were hurt and someone died as far as my responsibility for that goes it stops there because i know our message is actually very positive
7446706 you have something like this happen it could have been marilyn manson it could have been any number of people who make art that is startling visually on the darker side
7446707 it couldve been pat boone for christs sake at the end of the day there are always going to be mental disorders and people who cause violence for no other reason than the fact that theyre f cked up and lost
7446708 the state of the nation violation a broken promise is as good as a lie the hell is humungous the devils among us and we will burn because we wont unite
7446709 when i put on the mask everything became dead quiet and my body moved
7446710 people will find every other reason for this tragedy they will blame the band they will blame the devil they will blame the school but they wont acknowledge that this kid is a disturbed psychopath and he is the one who committed the crime
7446711 when the media profile this kid theyll hopefully realise that it has nothing to do with slipknot or this supposed satanism theyre blaming it on its just another case of trying to find a scapegoat for something a kid in a conservative christian society did
7446712 you guys should come and rock sa with a underground gig you have a huge following all this bullsh t about some kid killing classmates with a sword in krugersdrop puts the blame on you i say f k that i say the conservative nature of all old school south africans can go to hell the older generation are so closed minded in sa blaming everything on the devil when they dont even know their arses from their faces we need you guys to come and wake everybody up
7446713 we are trying our best to stop this but it isnt easy it is impossible to trace back the mail as it is just so vast
7446714 i told one guy that if i wanted to do this i wouldnt include my own details on the bottom so that people could find me
7446715 if you try to ignore them it just makes it worse posted by juanita fortein on 25 aug 2008

7446717 my brother use to say always end a paper with a quote because someone before you has already said it better
7446718 three passions have governed my life the longings for love the search for knowledge and unbearable pity for the suffering of humankind love brings ecstasy and relieves loneliness in the union of love i have seen in a mystic miniature the prefiguring vision of the heavens that saints and poets have imagined with equal passion i have sought knowledge i have wished to understand the hearts of people i have wished to know why the stars shine love and knowledge led upwards to the heavens but always pity brought me back to earth cries of pain reverberated in my heart of children in famine of victims tortured and of old people left helpless i long to alleviate the evil but i cannot and i too suffer this has been my life i found it worth living
7446719 one cannot imagine hillary clinton avoiding such a trip surely an aspiring world leader would want to acquaint himself in greater detail with an apparent success story in the resolution of conflict
7446720 a more likely explanation might well be the unimportance his campaign strategists attach to the irish vote in america
7446721 its a great interesting story and his irish ancestry is not widely known in america this is a chance to tell that story to irish americans and to highlight the close bonds between ireland and africa

7446727 wenn man eine bernahme macht muss man kompromissbereit sein das ist wie in einer ehe
7446728 auch diese marken haben noch potenzial vor allem auf ihren regionalen m rkten
7446729 wir haben aber schon zwei projekte aus anderen sektoren des konzerns gewonnen
7446730 inca de la intrarea pe piata din romania ne am declarat intentia de a oferi si produse complementare serviciilor de creditare
7446731 pentru 2008 estimam ca acest ritm de crestere se va mentine fiind sustinut atat de noile constructii imobiliare si implicit de numarul mare de credite ipotecare ce vor rezulta din vanzarea acestora cat si de faptul ca gradul de penetrare al asigurarilor in romania este scazut 1 77 din pib comparativ cu tarile din europa centrala si de est
7446732 but he said this project really looked like it was doable
7446733 the surveys are coming in well one of the problems is that several have come without addresses
7446734 we also have a forecast of rain this week its supposed to be a wet week
7446735 we would ask residents to please be careful as they start burning
7446736 there is still a lot of dry grass and fuel on the ground that could cause a fire hazard so do be cautious as you burn
7446737 since stp is a complicated partnership we needed to make sure with the texas governors office that we were nominating the proper entity
7446738 instead of applying in the september application period we will apply in the december application period
7446739 there are still some issues of concern that we need to work out before you approve this
7446740 this officer recognized the owner of the vehicle as someone that was wanted by our department
7446741 the individual finally came to a stop in the parking lot of sansings convenience store
7446742 the pursuit never reached a high rate of speed and no people or property was damaged in the pursuit and arrest
7446743 there are no known suspects but there are some persons of interest
7446744 its almost unheard of to be able to recover every single stolen item except for cases of beer and some food in something like this
7446745 sgt kurtis brown investigator responsible for recovering stolen property and identifying the suspects went outside the box and really gave an extra effort to make this happen
7446746 once those patrol officers were able to give brown some information they obtained during that traffic stop he ran with it
7446747 we located the 19 year old man and he is turning himself in today
7446748 we still have not located the other suspect and we hope we can get the public to help us out with that
7446749 burglars scout areas and target the places that are most vulnerable
7446750 during one of the suspect interviews they revealed different areas in the county that they planned to burglarize
7446751 they told me that the only thing that would have stopped them is if they got caught
7446752 we really want to commend kurtis brown on everything hes done to help solve this case so quickly and completely
7446753 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
7446754 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
7446755 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
7446756 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
7446757 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
7446758 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
7446759 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
7446760 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
7446761 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
7446762 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
7446763 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
7446764 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
7446765 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
7446766 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
7446767 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
7446768 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
7446769 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
7446770 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
7446771 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
7446772 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
7446773 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
7446774 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
7446775 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
7446776 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
7446777 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
7446778 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
7446779 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
7446780 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
7446781 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
7446782 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
7446783 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
7446784 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
7446785 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
7446786 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
7446787 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
7446788 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
7446789 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
7446790 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
7446791 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
7446792 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
7446793 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
7446794 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
7446795 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
7446796 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
7446797 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
7446798 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
7446799 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
7446800 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
7446801 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
7446802 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
7446803 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
7446804 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
7446805 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
7446806 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
7446807 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
7446808 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
7446809 but now a group of settler rabbis overwhelmingly ashkenazim of eastern european origin are challenging the jerusalem rabbinates reliance on isserles the ashkenazi codifier
7446810 two arabs from nablus ahab abu riyal and anas salum were arrested by israeli shin bet officers last month before they could carry out their mission to poison israelis on behalf of hizballah
7446811 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
7446812 this is a planning took where all things are going
7446813 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
7446814 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
7446815 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
7446816 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
7446817 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
7446818 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
7446819 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
7446820 la mayor a de los casos se resolver n en los pr ximos d as
7446821 is that it was strange so out of character for pow wow and believe me we get a lot here
7446822 he wanted pictures from all the way around and always two pictures it was weird
7446823 are we talking a 300 million pullout to bring in 300 million
7446824 hva om vi sender 250 000 fargede sprettballer nedover de bratte gatene i san francisco
7446825 hva om vi rigger 1400 eksplosjoner med 70 000 liter farget maling og bare farger en hel bygning og greier
7446826 hva om vi sender tusenvis av fargede tr dsneller nedover en pyramide slik at den blir dekket av farge
7446827 hva om vi lager stop motion animasjon med hundrevis av kaniner midt i gatene p en storby
7446828 the liquidation order will initiate a process that will probably lead to an investigation into the estate of tiger wheel
7446829 although the early use of p2p networks was for digital piracy p2p networks are increasingly being used for legitimate content distribution including music video and software
7446830 for example grooveshark rvibe we7 and imesh are firms that use p2p networks to distribute music to users the music is licensed from the music labels the files are distributed from users machines and the p2p firms provide software and billing a number of technologies have also emerged to prevent piracy in p2p networks as a result distribution of digital products through p2p networks is likely to become more prevalent
7446831 rvibe pays 5 cents for a 99 cent track grooveshark has recently changed its policy but i think it was originally 10 cents a song our conclusion is that you want to offer really high payments early on and that payments shouldnt be fixed we found in many cases that the referral payment could be higher than the price for example you might initially pay 1 50 for a 99 cent file
7446832 the initial high payment brings in a lot of distributors and it gets them to share files when theres scarcity
7446833 the optimal strategy seems to be to price the product low at first and pay the majority of the amount collected to the p2p distributor
7446834 so initially your profits are lowest over time you increase your price and reduce your referral payments
7446835 in the past it was difficult to do customized pricing
7446836 the music industry has generally been one that was slow to adapt
7446837 and apple has the capital and expertise to manage that but not everyone does
7446838 allows a firm to efficiently distribute media at a relatively low cost
7446839 further the distribution infrastructure automatically scales as new consumers join the network
7446840 apple is going to find it impractical to negotiate deals with a lot of independent unknown artists while with a grooveshark or rvibe the independent artist signs up for the service creates an account and uploads his songs
7446841 apple isnt going to want to negotiate contracts with a bunch of unknowns
7446842 but i do think its here to stay i recollect a statement that i read in early 2000 where somebody said p2p was a solution in search of a problem thats moot now
7446843 when i saw him on the podium i was the happiest man in the world
7446844 i just woke up before 5am and i had the spasm in my neck it was quite a big problem which nearly led to me not racing this weekend
7446845 it was so bad i was struggling to stand up and so i had to have injections in my neck and take plenty of painkillers pedro de la rosa was looking forward to racing
7446846 fortunately ive got a great doctor who was with the whole way through it its still sore it was probably something to do with my pillow the way i was sleeping
7446847 we need to get this matter resolved before the transfer deadline
7446848 if berbatov goes we will need time to sign a replacement we want to have the best centre forward we can possibly get
7446849 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
7446850 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
7446851 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
7446852 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
7446853 cegueira vergonhosa num artigo de opini o publicado nesta p gina na semana passada o articulista denunciou um caso de publicidade encapotada a favor da praia galega de san xenxo ao mesmo tempo que a rtp afundava as praias da p voa de varzim o autor do texto disse claramente que o problema do saneamento b sico em portugal e particularmente na costa portuguesa uma vergonha e que o saneamento b sico um problema de todos e n o apenas das c maras municipais do governo ou das autoridades sanit rias mas h quem ache que tomar estas posi es branquear a imagem da c mara da p voa e do seu presidente pelos vistos a c mara municipal da p voa de varzim tem a obriga o de construir um exutor submarino e da sua exclusiva compet ncia eliminar da costa mar tima todos os efluentes que contaminam as guas do mar pode ser que a cegueira partid ria n o os deixe ver o que bvio
7446854 defensive quality of its shopping centre assets in a depressed economy
7446855 these are more line stores and restaurants the money is coming in but it is coming in slower
7446856 we are able to show good growth coming through in six months they show the quality of our portfolio
7446857 populism demagoguery debasement of language outrageous allegations of conspiracies meant to interfere with the administration of justice or law enforcement and wild exaggerations
7446858 the militarisation of our political discourse talking of shoot the bastards prepare for war ready to kill ready to fight to take over the streets reference to counter revolutionary courts was not only offensive but constitute a danger to our democratic order
7446859 such language is intimidatory and precludes any debate about ends and means
7446860 a vigorous healthy democracy entails no doubt vigorous robust debate
7446861 but there is a thin line between such debate and language that is so excessive that its use erodes the fabric of democratic discourse if not our democratic institutions
7446862 the registered medical practitioner may only perform such an abortion if the medical practitioner reasonably believes that the abortion is appropriate in all the circumstances and the medical practitioners belief is supported by at least one other registered medical practitioner
7446863 punish medical staff who refuse to co operate in an abortion
7446864 a registered medical practitioner is under a duty to perform an abortion and a registered nurse is under a duty to assist in the performance of an abortion in an emergency where the abortion is necessary to preserve the life of the pregnant woman
7446865 deny legal protection to women being coerced to have an abortion
7446866 allow violent offenders to end the life of an unborn child without murder or manslaughter charges
7446867 tata motors can produce from pantnagar up to a capacity of 30 000 35 000 nanos
7446868 in case singur fails the roll out is expected from that plant its capacity could be ramped up later on
7446869 youve probably all seen about 120gb the fcc and just wanted to send you a note to confirm that is indeed part of the plan theres definitely more details coming in the way of new software and hardware pricing etc
7446870 most surprising to me was a reference she made to a conversation shed had with her late husband about the garbage disposal in which she quoted him as calling her
7446871 la mia opinione personale che un referendum rappresenta la risposta appropriata alla posizione in cui ci troviamo
7446872 se vogliamo mantenere una posizione costruttiva di membro della ue non possiamo semplicemente stare con le mani in mano e continuare a dire no significa no
7446873 there are many examples of this behavior especially when it comes to our lawsuit at strasbourg against the four european states that i have sued over the destruction of our holy places in kosovo then the issue of a memorandum which he teodosije supported
7446874 dual authority in the ra ko prizrenska eparchy had to end therefore our deeply thought through decisions came and then ensued open mutiny in de ani
7446875 whether kosovo is inside serbia an autonomy or an independent state
7446876 even the theoretical possibility of the orthodox churches acknowledging the apostolic succession
7446877 the representative of the moscow patriarchate expressed the hope that a similar event would not be repeated in the church of england and that the anglican communion as a whole would continue to support traditional standards of christian morality as expressed in the gospels and the writings of the church fathers
7446878 we are in constant communication with them and with god asking for his guidance

7446882 there is no doubt anymore about that foreign partener lufthansa is in pole position to conclude an alliance
7446883 emergency situations ministry spokesman ramis satybekov said the crash was likely caused by either an engine failure or a malfunction in the planes flight control system government spokeswoman roza daudova however said the cause of the crash was decompression of the jet
7446884 a woman was flying from seattle to san francisco unexpectedly the plane was diverted to sacramento along the way the flight attendant explained that there would be a delay and if the passengers wanted to get off the aircraft the plane would re board in 50 minutes
7446885 kathy we are in sacramento for almost an hour would you like to get off and stretch your legs
7446886 no thanks but maybe buddy would like to stretch his legs

7446892 i saw things that hurt my head before i passed out

7446950 mma is turning into kickboxing in the cage pretty much thats just the way the sport has evolved
7446951 ive been kickboxing for six or seven years so this is something different i like it because its not easy and if we want to train to be fighters weve got to be ready for any kind of fight any time on all different terrains
7446952 im going all the way this time im 100 better than i used to be and committed to becoming a champion

7447009 these people are criminals and they must be brought to the bar of justice and apprehend them and theres an additional instruction to take active measures to prevent the recurrence of the atrocities
7447010 it is the fundamental duty of the state to enforce its laws particularly in the atrocious circumstances i think the statement of al haj murad to stand down is not enough he must either surrender these commanders or allow them to turn themselves in

7447032 ignoring this trend within the eu and its impact on people of faith has inevitable political and social consequences not least on levels of support for the project itself

7447048 we will look at fielding our local players first and should there be a need for a position i wont have a problem to take on board a fijian
7447049 i am especially here to learn more about the players and their environment and how we can deal with them and what is important to them
7447050 this is the same for sireli as i wanted to see how he did things here and what his lifestyle and family life was like compared to south africa
7447051 we have been talking to him and there are no problems
7447052 he had a great super 14 season and we were impressed and looking forward to 2009

7447059 what is my need in this situation thats stopping me from delegating
7447060 when thousands of peoples is riled up to see you that could arouse your ego

7447065 i dont begrudge a single cent of the money spent preparing our athletes for the olympics
7447066 i think most kiwis would feel very proud of the achievements of the team
7447067 well need to see the detailed debrief and look at how much needs to go into the next effort
7447068 the reality is you cant compete at this very top level of international sport like the olympics as a gifted amateur you have to have the whole envelope of support around you and that costs
7447069 we can never be totally happy the world is moving on in terms of performance and if we stay still we will get further behind so what that means is that in our review which will take place when we get back we have to look for another edge

7447096 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7447097 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees

7447102 nuestra duda actual que en gran medida es la misma que afecta a la mayor a de los inversores es hasta qu punto todo esto la crisis est ya descontado en los precios de las acciones nosotros pensamos que si bien es factible que haya todav a algunos recortes las cotizaciones de muchas compa as cotizadas empiezan ya a estar significativamente por debajo de su valoraci n en funci n de un escenario relativamente negativo en este sentido el mayor riesgo que observamos es que el sector financiero sufra en mayor medida de lo que esperamos ahora los efectos de la crisis subprime una crisis que no tocar fondo hasta que lo haga el mercado de viviendas estadounidense como ya hemos se alado
7447103 we do not know where bishop jia is detained at this time we also do not know why he was arrested again this time

7447173 the reality is there probably wont be any more data breach activity than normal were just going to hear and talk about every one now which is a healthy thing because it provides transparency and establishes security performance as a market differentiator but it will be painful for a few years
7447174 while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice
7447175 once an agency and organisation has discovered or suspects that a personal information security breach has occurred they should take immediate common sense steps to limit the breach
7447176 notification can be an important mitigation strategy that has the potential to benefit both the agency or organisation and the individuals affected by a personal information security breach the challenge is to determine when notification is appropriate while notification is an important mitigation strategy it will not always be the appropriate response to a breach providing notification about low risk breaches can cause undue anxiety and de sensitise individuals to notice each incident needs to be considered on a case by case basis to determine whether breach notification is required

7447185 it feels as good as last year when we really didnt know what to expect we just said well lets play have some fun this year the other competitors really stepped up their game there were a lot of smokers and a lot of really great ribs
7447186 we were going to go in with our recipe from last year but thursday evening we had a few folks over and did four different ribs four versions of smoked ribs along with our original cooked on a gas grill and the one we submitted saturday was the fan favourite from that night
7447187 we marinated them overnight in apple juice then used a rub thats a combination of brown sugar lime juice fresh ginger garlic and other stuff
7447188 the mop was chicken broth dark rum lime juice and fresh habaneros and the sauce was based on guava and mango
7447189 i put them in the smoker this morning for a little under three hours then pulled them out and rested them in foil for a few hours
7447190 then we seared and sauced on a gas grill to finish them
7447191 in the near future ill be designing my own clothes as well so im looking forward to that
7447192 she was definitely sexy but wasnt trying to be and i loved that
7447193 i really like to do it knitting but i always kind of have a hole in it
7447194 i dont have anything made yet for my baby but maybe i will
7447195 i think your mother instincts really kick in the day you find out that youre pregnant and for me its been a blast preparing for it getting the nursery ready and all that so were both really looking forward to it
7447196 thats definitely the frustrating part about it but our home is very private and what goes on in our home is very private
7447197 people just really see pictures and make assumptions of what were doing
7447198 we havent decided where were going to raise our kid but for the first year well stay in california
7447199 there isnt that divide where theres a couple of huge movies coming every week
7447200 diverting to land cook for hospitalization on advice medical officer stop
7447201 when i got to grade 9 our teacher was sick different times so we got different teachers for the rest of the year and nobody graded out of grade 9
7447202 the next year we got another teacher mrs rudolph and she taught us out of the wrong book for science and one person graded that year
7447203 they were just opening up and when we went there they didnt have a gym there was a door but there was nothing there when you opened it
7447204 the lobsters they were catching they were huge great big things some of the guys went ashore and saw what we were doing here cleaning them out and mounting them on a board so thats what they started to do with these great big ones and theyd take them ashore and sell them to different people
7447205 they were out there all fishing season and they had small vessels fishing and theyd take their catch to a mother ship where it would be frozen to go back to russia
7447206 in those days when a ship came in we would order a pilot and the tugs and a dock and if they required anything special they would let us know at every dock there was a customs officer and a national harbour board policeman and wed go on to examine their papers
7447207 they had a little tanker a bit bigger than the dartmouth ferries and he used to come in two or three times a week to get fresh water and take it back out to the fishing fleet
7447208 the first russian ship that i saw that we were the agents for they put them up at pier 9 and as they went up the harbour there they were on their decks taking movies of the harbour in those days it was the cold war and here they were taking pictures of all our navy facilities as they went up to pier 9
7447209 because if you dont have a full glass you wont have a full life that was their saying
7447210 we had to bring her ashore and call the russian embassy in ottawa so she could find out if it was ok for her to give me the passports
7447211 finally we got them and it was all looked after
7447212 maktab sabah no1 i really doubt that somehow lol but the truth is i overheard this from one student maktab had grown so much more weaker every year generations after generations
7447213 youre 18 now you should be able to take care your own life now
7447214 and isnt it awfully nice when you get that certificate

7447216 even lifting a lame arm to put it over the dog its just like a calm comes over their face
7447217 animals are my total life or have been ever since i was a kid
7447218 i grew up with dogs cats white mice a few thousand tropical fish budgie birds horse cows pigs my friends had the farm but i was always out there all we ever did was move so you never stayed any place very long and so consequently you never had real close friends except your animals its family

7447221 the concept of value for value is the foundation for all sound harmonious human relationships value for value is another way of saying win win the surest way to succeed in any endeavor is to make certain that all parties to a transaction come out ahead
7447222 you always get what you pay for you pay nothing youll get nothing
7447223 you do no work we do it all for you
7447224 the lights are on but youre not home your mind is not your own
7447225 creating legitimate value is the straightest line between where you are now and where you want to be it is a major component of getting what you want in life it doesnt matter how fast or how hard you work if your efforts dont create value for others and creating value stems from passion passion stems from belief in what youre doing belief in what youre doing stems from working at something you not only are good at but enjoy when you get all these factors going in the right direction you have no trouble being motivated to do whatever it takes to succeed there is nothing quite so exhilarating as working yourself to the point of exhaustion for months or even years then being handsomely rewarded for your efforts in the marketplace every human being should treat himself to this drug free high at least once in his lifetime
7447226 you gotta put something in first if you want to get something out
7447227 money is a measure of the value that people place on goods and services the amount of money you earn in a competitive market is the measure of value that others place on your contribution so to increase the amount of money you are getting out you must increase the value of the work that you are putting in

7447238 on wall street the most unnerving stock market reports since the depression 1930s became daily more dismal

7447249 he was going into areas that hadnt been done before taking auto parts by truck to the service stations he was the guy who serviced the service stations
7447250 he put every penny away that he could i think that comes from having lived through a depression and a war i think it changed a lot of men of that age they realized how important it was to have something set aside in case something were to happen
7447251 mike and his wife were wonderful parents and he was one of the kindest fathers i have ever known

7447320 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7447321 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7447322 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7447323 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7447324 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7447325 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7447326 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event

7447350 are they at the absolute best that they ought to be not quite
7447351 this salary structure seems like a clear recipe for mediocrity rather than excellence
7447352 indeed it its interviews with some recently hired staff economists the committee heard several comments like i didnt receive any other job offers so i accepted the position at the bank of canada
7447353 in most cases the problem does not appear to be a lack of analytical or technical skills but rather an insufficient understanding of what constitutes an interesting question or a useful answer from an economic perspective
7447354 the canadian taxpayer in the end has to decide do we need a world class research department at the bank of canada and are we willing to pay the price
7447355 only two papers out of 240 produced at the bank in recent years have been accepted for publication in top tier field journals and only a few others are currently under editorial review at such journals
7447356 many of the papers do not address questions of sufficient interest or importance to merit publication
7447357 women have far more options and arent tied to wearing stuffy suits and ties they can come to work with bare legs and no one will complain
7447358 you guys dont realize how lucky you are those suits keep you warm while we sit at our desks freezing and you dont waste nearly as much time thinking about whether things match
7447359 have the short end of the deal when it comes to summer attire at the office
7447360 although a dress code exists for both men and women my experience has shown that it is usually enforced more rigidly for men than women
7447361 maybe it is just my imagination or just that managers find it easier to enforce
7447362 men have less choice which makes it much simpler to get dressed in the morning
7447363 women have far too much choice so it becomes far more confusing
7447364 to be perfectly honest the rules are a bit more lax when it comes to women
7447365 theres inappropriateness in womens dress at the office and that applies to winter too i think women are just using summer as an excuse to wear things that are less appropriate
7447366 if women didnt shave their legs then they might be a little better off
7447367 im not against casual dressing but if you want to be successful you have to look successful
7447368 if you go to work thinking about comfort all the time then maybe youre in the wrong profession

7447402 the award winning writer and producer behind the thick of it and im alan partridge has called on the bbc to launch a subscription channel to fund rivals to ambitious us shows such as the sopranos and the wire
7447403 uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment but on a big rather than timid scale lets take a wager that the bbc brand is the best tv brand in the world that people will pay for that brand

7447441 qualche utente si lamentato del fatto che il contatore sia inattendibile e non rispetti effettivamente il numero delle visite
7447442 poliedrica gran burlone e organizzatore di scherzi sincera affezionata dolce e coccolosa
7447443 simpatica che non perde occasioni per fare battute dicesi anche battutaro di prima categoria ma anche gentile allegro solare divertente
7447444 preferite che gli altri siano attratti dalla vostra personalit piuttosto che dal vostro aspetto questo non significa che non dobbiate mantenervi in forma ma che volete si sappia soprattutto che siete intelligenti
7447445 felice del binomio spirito e corpo vivi con le giuste percezioni e con la consapevolezza di chi non ha nulla da invidiare a nessuno ecco perch appari sempre sicuro di te e delle tue azioni estroverso e spregiudicato sempre allaltezza dosato
7447446 hai un carattere molto timido e introverso non aleggia in te nemmeno un briciolo di spudoratezza sei talmente distante da questo atteggiamento che ti sfugge persino il significato fai della riservatezza una ragione di vita non ti sbilanci mai e hai la rara capacit di mantenere sempre il controllo anche quando tutto e tutti ti sono avversi chi ti conosce davvero non ha dubbi in proposito
7447447 riesci a far buon uso del linguaggio sei sicuro di te stesso e non parli mai a vanvera non fai del linguaggio una ragione di vita ma quando occorre sai spiegarti perfettamente hai la capacit di trovare le parole giuste quando la situazione lo richiede senza per questo scadere nella retorica un buon uso della dialettica condito dalla condizione di saper ascoltare moderato
7447448 hai lambizione di crescere professionalmente del resto perch non dovrebbe essere cos ci non significa necessariamente che sei disposto a sacrificare ogni istante della tua esistenza per il lavoro hai linnata capacit di saperti adattare alle circostanze non esiti a sacrificarti per raggiungere ottimi risultati ma il tuo tempo libero e i tuoi interessi sono sacri composto
7447449 hai un rapporto piuttosto concreto e stabile con il tuo denaro non ami sbilanciarti fare il cosiddetto passo pi lungo della gamba non nel tuo stile questo per non significa che tu non sappia toglierti certe soddisfazioni sei concreto e attento al risparmio ma anche disposto a sacrifici per coltivare i tuoi interessi la tua sembrerebbe la politica vincente il modo migliore per godersi la vita
7447450 i pensieri che corrono le frasi che segnano le emozioni che proviamo
7447451 sei la persona pi tenera e dolce che abbia mai incontrato in questo mondo fatato
7447452 le mie coccole sono per quella persona che quando ho iniziato con il blog mi ha insegnato ad inserire immagini scritte e come si pu parlare con la gente anche se in modo virtuale sono le coccole di un genitore a cui tu come figlio hai insegnato a passare qualche ora nel blog e a conoscere tanta gente stupenda forse virutale ma forse pi vera di chi ti pi vicino una forte stretta di mano
7447453 non ho resistito alla tentazione e sono ripassata complimenti per il tuo blog mi piace moltissimo ho iniziato a leggere qualcosa e pi leggevo e pi avevo voglia di andare avanti proprio come un romanzo che ti appassiona
7447454 lo sai forse il motivo del tuo successo che scrivi tanto ogni giorno hai un blog super aggiornato scrivi cose che vivi sulla tua pelle cose semplici della vita quotidiana le scrivi dettagliate con trasporto ed emozione sei sincero parli ai lettori con voce umile sei diventato un posto di ritrovo continua a tenerci compagnia ancora
7447455 i tuoi post sono molto belli e fatti con amore complimenti
7447456 credo che il tuo blog sia sempre stato uno dei pi interessanti
7447457 leggo spesso il tuo blog sono una tra tante e mi piace un sacco quello che hai da dire
7447458 se il blog fosse un paese tu saresti sicuramente la piazza del duomo
7447459 quando non mi senti parlare vuol dire che sto parlando dentro
7447460 lamore e un incendio che ti sfugge dal controllo che non puoi pi domare che scoppia e non puoi spegnere e travolge tutto quello che trova intorno
7447461 ma aldil delle frasi fatte che una donna vuole sentirsi dire correggetemi se sbaglio penso che non c bisogno di essere degli studiosi per far felice una donna no basta solo lamore e una volta tanto basta solo far parlare il cuore e dire qualcosa di carino ricordandosi sempre che il cuore a parlare perch lamore in fondo solo un incontro di emozioni nate pure e vitali nel nostro profondo e siccome penso che le donne vadano adorate e corteggiate ogni giorno e che ogni giorno vadano premiate per tutto quello che le donne fanno per noi maschietti per rendere loro il nostro grazie basta solo far parlare il cuore e allora si che una donna sar felice
7447462 quando vedi qualcuno che invidioso di te guardalo negli occhi e digli
7447463 niente che non fosse vero ho solo riscritto il tuo in maniera diversa
7447464 i figli sono strani un giorno sono piccoli triciclisti e un altro giorno jumbo jettano verso luniversit
7447465 sorridi anche se sei triste perch non c nulla di pi triste della tristezza di non poter sorridere
7447466 ho vissuto un film e lui non ha visto la stessa pellicola
7447467 i never heard from her i still havent to this day
7447468 id like to think forgiveness is possible but when her name comes up in conversation i have a tendency to spit out of the side of my mouth
7447469 i realized that i didnt need her drama in my life
7447470 what we found is that when men recalled their own offenses they were more likely to empathize and then forgive but they had to do that emotional work first
7447471 when the women started thinking about their own offenses they tended to feel defensive and guilty and that made it harder for them to forgive
7447472 my father was physically abusive but the most intense hurt was his refusal to talk to me after i hit him
7447473 i just didnt know how to start the process of forgiving
7447474 it wasnt until i was in my forties when i was able to empathize with my fathers situation that he had learned ineffective parenting from his parents and that he was short tempered because he was physically ill that i was able to forgive him
7447475 this was the 60s and early 70s and there were not resources that we knew of to help us
7447476 forgiving my father and my mother for staying helped me learn to trust my instincts and myself be more present in relationships and build loving honest bonds with others
7447477 forgive for love the missing ingredient for a healthy and lasting relationship
7447478 now i can remember good things about him he was an incredibly effective childrens advocate and community organizer in harlem for example
7447479 the things he passed on to me my sense of justice fairness political sensitivity history and my power as a voting consumer are greater gifts than the scars he left behind
7447480 what those gray clad modest young warriors have accomplished will be remembered longer than any of their lives
7447481 the dont even work thats why theyre out at the game

7447498 heavy metal shred mayhem now with 50 more guitar solos if the new unearth songs were laundry detergent then this is what it would say on the box
7447499 fortunately for all you metal maniacs its not laundry soap but a mind blowing journey consisting of epic mosh and shred so we had to call in the one man who could wrangle such a massive beast adam dutkiewicz we are very excited to be working with him again and between 40 oz chugging and doing burn outs in kens 82 corvette we are recording what will definitely be the best album of our career
7447500 the talent within the band is obvious brutish melodies guitar runs that are as creative as they are powerful a major force
7447501 big chunky riffs raspy throat roar vocals baterram drums an innate sense for the theatrical like better produced 80s skateboard thrash pretty great
7447502 challenging and non repetitive without relinquishing one iota of aggro attitude
7447503 unearth are one of the very best at what they do at the gates and in flames disciples will bask in the galloping rhythms and the dizzying depths of guitarists ken susi and buz mcgraths ever intertwined riffs and electrifying lead acrobatics go metal thrashing mad
7447504 if we are forced to conclude that change will not be forthcoming from the executive then we will have no option but to pull out our ministers and seek to put pressure where responsibility ultimately lies which is on the british government in london
7447505 it is their usual grandstanding it seems to be the only course sinn fein knows they will have to learn that this course of action will not produce results
7447506 we will only move on policing and justice when the time is right and all the conditions are met it is time for sinn fein to deal with issues properly they should know by now we are not a party to be bullied we will only move when we consider the time to be right
7447507 i would suggest that it would be more befitting for o caolain to keep his focus on sinn feins affairs in the south and leave issues pertaining to northern ireland to those who are elected here to deal with them
7447508 whilst the dup has made it clear to the sinn fein leadership that we are committed to working through outstanding issues and bringing them to a resolution such language as has been used by this sinn fein representative begins to cast significant doubt on sinn feins commitment to making progress in stormont
7447509 i call upon the deputy first minister martin mcguinness to say whether or not mr o caolain was speaking for sinn fein ministers
7447510 if martin mcguinness does not distance himself from this statement then a full blown crisis is facing the executive next month
7447511 it was a hard struggle for his family who covered almost every cost of his preparation for the olympics his community from north belfast also put their hands in their pockets to raise funds to help paddy

7447531 anybody coming in or going out is going through me

7447533 that everyone no matter what physical limitations life might have given them should have a chance to take pleasure from a day in the sun enjoying all the wonder the ocean has to offer
7447534 surfing is a selfish act because youre trying to get the best wave for yourself even when youre out with friends
7447535 but danny is out there trying to get the best waves for people who otherwise wouldnt be able to enjoy them
7447536 i can tell you all about it and it wont do it justice

7447542 we had to resolve how to offer the service on the fly
7447543 it is an issue that is not really subject to debate
7447544 for the people with money this was not a problem
7447545 but for our people with no resources what could they do they went to clandestine clinics
7447546 i am a catholic but i have convictions i dont think im going to hell if i go it will be for something else

7447548 theres a good handful of em where the seals on the bottom arent done property because that was my job
7447549 the cars would come along the line and i ad this big soldering gun but it was the night shift and i kept falling asleep id look up and the car had gone down the line and id missed a good nine spots those cars must be falling apart by now
7447550 if one of em belongs to you dear reader im sorry about that that was me
7447551 id see all these guys whod been there 50 years their skin had turned into leather their hands had veins as big as f worms yknow what i mean i thought i dont want to be that
7447552 my old man finally found me and said your shop steward is screaming at me trying to work out where the f you are
7447553 youre black with a british accent and theyre like he makes a face say that again
7447554 i was trying so hard to desperately pretend that i was american i just walked around all day practising my accent and seeing if i could fool people like bus drivers
7447555 that character and i mirrored each other in many ways
7447556 he was ridiculously ambitious very good at multitasking and he was courageous he who dares wins man its a clich to say it but its really true ive taken some f risks and if i hadnt taken those risks i wouldnt be here without a doubt its all about not allowing the fear of failure to cripple ya i love it if you tell me i cant do somethin
7447557 i was in this very hotel and guy calls me and says im doing this movie and i want you to be in it
7447558 i saw revolver it was a beautiful looking film but it just lost me completely this movie rocknrolla is a step in the direction that we knew im for
7447559 guys very calm and collected on the outside and he works extensively on trying to rid himself of any kind of angst
7447560 he has interesting people skills he sort of engages with you and at the same time has his mind elsewhere
7447561 although it was very surreal when his wife would show up
7447562 i said hi how are you she was very yknow in and out
7447563 they were seemingly fine but i honestly couldnt tell you i wasnt paying attention
7447564 its funny cos i feel like in england were allowed to laugh about that a little bit more when i read it in the script i didnt think nothing of it ive got this english friend right and this is his favourite joke idris youre gay gay jokes are just part of english culture in a way right and so i saw an extension of that in this movie i never saw it as homophobic or homoerotic
7447565 for a long time ive been very private with my life but ive just realised you know what who cares
7447566 i should date that girl who interviewed me in new york
7447567 genmab and gsk have worked diligently to expand the ofatumumab development program to maximize the value of the antibody for patients and shareholders since our collaboration began

7447570 the system we use will never be as important as the people we choose
7447571 state of the art the leadership interview with andy stanley
7447572 every since he graduated high school josh has been fat and lazy
7447573 i got stymied behind the tree and i got lucky because i got a drop because of some gopher holes or whatever it was
7447574 it wasnt where my ball was but like about 5 or 6 feet left it was actually moving you could see the grass going up and down it was actually there and we were trying to find it but we couldnt
7447575 i just wanted to know why he got a drop there was obviously a mole there and he was burrowing at that moment you could see him popping out i was really focused on what i was doing
7447576 westchester was a good golf course this tops westchester every single player out there absolutely enjoyed this golf course
7447577 i was surprised to see it go in and he was even more surprised to see mine go in
7447578 its hard to see your friend not win especially if hes playing against you but somebody has to win
7447579 i really am happy with how i played and obviously disappointed i wasnt able to play a little bit better in the playoff
7447580 ive got to forget about that and think about the other 72 holes
7447581 it was a tough day it wasnt easy to get close to the hole so birdie was difficult to come by
7447582 it was drying out really really a lot and youve got to play almost conservative on some holes
7447583 but it was a great playoff though i enjoyed that
7447584 i was a good round and it gives me some momentum to carry over
7447585 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7447586 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7447587 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7447588 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7447589 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7447590 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7447591 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7447592 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7447593 i dont know debian does it differently to everyone else
7447594 you must have rules for the foomeister 3000 video card on your system
7447595 rules for video cards will look like this and be stored here

7447672 refusal to sign an agreement on non use of force and its aggressive actions in the beginning of august which result in the death of thousand civilians of south ossetians has become aggravated the georgian abkhazian conflict and has definitively deprived the georgian management of the right to demand that the people of south ossetia and abkhazia be dependent on its adventurist policy
7447673 powers outside the caucasus region should not seek excuses for tensions and instability in the crisis area
7447674 their destiny in the caucasus would definitely not be different than the dilemma they have in other regions where they have already created a crisis
7447675 the conflict between the two world powers us and russia are indeed subject of concern
7447676 we support peace and stability in the caucasus area and the crisis over there should be tackled within its own place
7447677 we however hope that wrong calculations and signals would not lead to renewed conflicts
7447678 aggressive actions which result in the death of thousand of south ossetian civilians and aggravated the georgian abkhazian conflict has with finality deprived the georgian leadership of the right to demand that the people of south ossetia and abkhazia be subject to its adventurist policy

7447684 this team has come a long way and we had a lot of blowouts those first few games
7447685 so it was fitting that this one would be a close one it really tested us to see what we were all about and in the end we showed were the best in the world
7447686 it was more teamwork probably well directed by their coaching staff
7447687 ive seen the guys hungry and want to get back to the top thats what theyve done they were able to get to the top again and show that they should be in first place but they had to work for it
7447688 if it wasnt for the determination and the willpower that we have in each other we wouldnt have pulled through and gotten this win

7447705 it was not a nice weekend but it is not the first time
7447706 we are in a bit of a worse situation in the championship but if we get all the things sorted then i think we still have a chance to come back
7447707 my mechanics did everything to try to allow me to continue but my race was already compromised
7447708 i am extremely disappointed because i was hoping to have a special race in my second home grand prix and for all the supporters who came here this weekend to support me
7447709 to come here to a new track we did a fantastic job it was really difficult to choose the right tires especially in qualifying but we did a perfect job in that and then making the pole position winning the race and making the fast lap i think it is nothing more we can ask for
7447710 cant complain about second place weve had quite a strong weekend nice new circuit got some good points heikki kovalainen and the team got some good points it was just overall a solid weekend for us
7447711 for the past few weeks ive been kind of compartmentalizing my emotions finally the filters came down
7447712 obviously this doesnt change anything because it doesnt bring todd back and cant vindicate it
7447713 but i can enjoy this and mourn todds death at the same time its just something i have to do
7447714 he has taken this program a long way he had a smile on his face and we havent seen that in a long long time it was a beautiful thing
7447715 hugh said he doesnt wear his heart on his sleeve but he does
7447716 i think it fueled his fire even more to lead us to this victory
7447717 making them happy just for a moment was a special feeling
7447718 your whole life has been spent on this one thing focused on this one goal
7447719 i cant explain how good it feels to have finally reached it

7447726 most importantly we are replacing our static per keyword quality scores with a system that will evaluate an ads quality each time it matches a search query this way adwords will use the most accurate specific and up to date performance information when determining whether an ad should be displayed your ads will be more likely to show when theyre relevant and less likely to show when theyre not this means that google users are apt to see better ads while you as an advertiser should receive leads which are more highly qualified
7447727 the new per query evaluation of quality score affects you in that keywords will no longer appear as inactive for search in your account instead all keywords will have the chance to show ads on google web search and the search network unless youve paused or deleted them keep in mind however that keywords previously marked inactive for search are not likely to accrue a great deal of traffic following this change this is because their combined per query quality score and bid probably isnt high enough to gain competitive placement
7447728 as a result of migrating to per query quality score we are no longer showing minimum bids in your account

7447744 arguably the strongest man now on the national scene after the bowing out of pervez musharraf would like to retain and wield the presidents sweeping powers
7447745 but one thing is certain he zardari will never become a president who will be just a symbolic head of the state

7447752 the development of the state should take precedence whichever government is in power
7447753 we will definitely restore the judges but after some debate in parliament
7447754 it is difficult to debate this issue for one day and i am not sure if the judges could be restored on monday aug 25

7447761 initially indications from the official quarters were that foreign minister shah mehmood qureshi would lead the pakistani delegation

7447763 the question of the expansion of the organisation is also expected to be taken up by the sco leaders at the summit it is believed that accession criteria are currently being reviewed to provide for admission of new members
7447764 an important proposal likely to be approved by the heads of state of the member countries pertains to the real involvement of observers and other interested countries which may become dialogue partners in practical work within the sco framework
7447765 they also agreed to a proposal on the sco dialogue partners that will allow all the interested countries to interact with the organisation and participate in all its activities projects and meetings

7447769 das war ein fantastisches rennen mit einer schwierigen strategischen entscheidung in der schlussphase
7447770 umso sch ner ist es dass wir nun schon zum dritten mal in folge mit einem doppelsieg in der american le mans serie vorsprung durch technik demonstrieren konnten und das gegen sehr starke konkurrenz gl ckwunsch an das gesamte team auch f r den vorzeitigen gewinn der herstellerwertung

7447777 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7447778 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7447779 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7447780 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7447781 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7447782 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7447783 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event

7447798 the demand for pivot3 high definition video storage has significantly increased this year and our vidicore partnership will help us meet the demand

7447800 we have been deeply involved in video surveillance for years and have been looking for a storage solution like pivot3 that matches the requirements of this fast growing market
7447801 we appreciate strong innovative technical companies and we expect to quickly introduce pivot3 to our reseller and integrator base with our joint focus on video surveillance and physical security i know we will build a strong presence together with pivot3 in the european market

7447956 its bad news added steve dewey a weed scientist at utah state universitys extension service and its still in the expanding mode where vehicles go it goes thats got to be the number one vector to the spiky menace
7447957 its horrid said krista bowers a volunteer coordinator and biking instructor with the salt lake city bicycle collective
7447958 we are concentrating on removing the newborns the pregnant mothers and any dogs who need immediate medical attention
7447959 all had poor ventilation the sheer number of animals was overwhelming and the odor of urine in 90 plus degree heat was stifling
7447960 it looks like it is going to be a fun one
7447961 you have to have two good legs and a good back to go to a convention
7447962 she has just been a stalwart of the party for many decades
7447963 we had eight hours of sleep in about five days
7447964 i loved meeting the candidates and picking someone i could work for
7447965 now you are lucky if you get anywhere near a candidate especially if you are from utah
7447966 i was very concerned about that a naming gift of that level usually only comes after years of cultivation
7447967 the city ends up with a fully functioning 11 million project even if we fail youre still coming out ahead
7447968 the city doesnt have an option to go another way
7447969 i would have done that immediately had the request been made by the leonardo
7447970 to have a turn key everything in place project right now
7447971 you will come to us to bail you out that is our fear
7447972 they can maybe come up with 1 million or 2 million max but they need to have at least 2 million to 3 million for operations for two years thats 6 million plus they want reserves
7447973 now i know why hes always looking at that one
7447974 i recommend a new tax on people who stifle development
7447975 im absolutely flattered that my name is being mentioned about managing the great britain team
7447976 would i take it if they offered it to me absolutely i would be a fool not to the fact it is being held on my old stamping ground in east london makes it even more appealing
7447977 nowadays in this age of e mail its pretty easy to communicate with a teacher
7447978 its important for parents to get all the facts before they come in with guns blasting
7447979 if parents respect educators and teachers then their children will
7447980 i dont think there can ever be too much as long as teachers and parents are working cooperatively
7447981 i would encourage them to use their cultures and languages and read to their children
7447982 i think parental input becomes too much when they try to shift the responsibility from the child
7447983 thats time i can spend in the classroom actually working with kids
7447984 the child realizes too this is important important enough for my mom or dad to be doing something
7447985 if we let politicians and school boards run everything then were going to be stuck with that
7447986 extracurricular activities are certainly wonderful but relaxation rest and time to play are important
7447987 parents need to plan their evenings so students will still get to their studies
7447988 if your child is getting tutoring you need to be involved and make sure your child is making progress not just at the tutoring center but also at the school
7447989 they get to that age in junior high where hormones take over and they have all these social things that take over
7447990 find those things your child is interested in and tap into them
7447991 parents can rearrange how they plan vacations to make historical sites first

7447999 look there goes david cook hes in that car right there with the tinted windows
7448000 the board have accepted the bid hes not renegotiated his contract and the decision was taken out of my hands
7448001 i dont know where anton is in terms of signing for sunderland but once the club accept the bid it moves on
7448002 we are thin on the ground and if we lose another defender we will have to react to that
7448003 im absolutely delighted you guys have all seen the rubbish thats been written in the papers in the last couple of weeks and its nice to just put it to bed now
7448004 its been unsettling for everyone including roque himself and were absolutely delighted at the club and the players are as well because he is a talisman for us
7448005 i think weve spent the last two weeks worrying if he was going to go or if he was going to stay and now we can put it to bed and concentrate on the premier league
7448006 i had sunderland manchester city newcastle stoke hull and west ham all interested in me its great to know that interest was there
7448007 at first i wanted to stay in london but i prefer portsmouth to west ham because they are the fa cup winners they are in europe and i know people here
7448008 im here firstly for the experience and i will certainly get that if i play regularly in matches and travel with the team
7448009 richard has come on leaps and bounds since he joined us
7448010 he had to sort of take a step down from west ham to colchester to go back up and hes proved he can do that
7448011 it was a tough decision to leave nicky barmby out from last week because he did a good hours work against fulham
7448012 but nicky is a million per cent behind what were trying to achieve at hull and he fully understood we needed to be physical against the combative midfield that blackburn possess
7448013 in christianity neither morality nor religion come into contact with reality at any point
7448014 they came in and they said drop the gun and i couldnt see the officer because he was behind me
7448015 i said its a movie its a movie were filming a movie

7448019 you know how to make yoghurt but you dont know anything about football
7448020 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned
7448021 anyone having link with this organization promoting its literature and message helping it financially or in any other way will be taken to task according to the law

7448030 someone in japan heard it at a japanese record company and he said
7448031 i was firmly established as the man in charge of looking after the ball when we were fielding
7448032 it was my job to keep the shine on the new ball for as long as possible with a bit of spit and a lot of polish and through trial and error i finally settled on type of spit for the task at hand
7448033 it had been common knowledge in county cricket for some time that certain sweets produced saliva which when applied to the ball for cleaning purposes enabled it to keep its shine for longer and therefore its swing
7448034 i had a go at murray mints and found they worked a treat
7448035 for the first time as i dived to gather the ball at square leg i landed on my side and a shower of murray mints spewed out of my trouser pocket all over the grass right in front of the umpire
7448036 fortunately neither he nor the two batsmen seemed to take much notice as i scrambled around on all fours trying desperately to gather in the sweets before they started asking awkward questions
7448037 the bus service across the line of control loc has been suspended as of today monday but is likely to be operational on its next scheduled date after a fortnight
7448038 guruji soren came to my residence and asked for my support in forming the government i told him that let me first call on madhu koda before giving my consent
7448039 every one has given their consent only i am left
7448040 we have more than 42 mlas in the effective assembly strength of 81
7448041 in view of the dilly dallying tactics of the government on the issue the samiti has decided to continue its agitation and so it extended the bandh upto august 31

7448045 i dont think that word means what you think it means
7448046 this is the exclusive right of president that releases a decree under the presentation of the rf foreign ministry
7448047 the state duma may only specify its standing by passing a respective address to the president
7448048 by recognizing independence of abkhazia and south ossetia we will breach the principle of territorial integrity of sovereign georgia besides there is the un security council resolution on abkhazia that spells out that the conflict is to be resolved in view of the territorial integrity of georgia if tbilisi goes to law the proceedings wont be in our favor
7448049 russias diplomacy has recognized the right of nations for self determination but not for self separation
7448050 the separation could happen provided the state commits crimes against the nation for kosovo russia hasnt recognized unilateral genocide by the serbs but it may play exactly on it in this case
7448051 non je ne peut pas vous laissez dire a donc allez voir ailleurs il ny a rien voir
7448052 1 they tend to send non verbal signals demonstrating a certain discomfort
7448053 how to let people become aware of their intellectual and social deficiencies
7448054 in many intellectual and social domains the skills needed to produce correct responses are virtually identical to those needed to
7448055 refers to the ability to evaluate responses as correct or incorrect
7448056 from what i have learnt for an oath to be valid both persons must be present
7448057 usually people would be very fearful when they swear on the quran
7448058 suffice to say it was a higher authority who asked me to do it
7448059 it is slander if anyone ever said i received money to witness
7448060 as a government servant we have to obey orders from above from time to time
7448061 for example i received a call which asked me if i was ustaz ramlang and when i said yes the person on the phone said i lacked manners kurang ajar would an ustaz want to be insulted as such
7448062 i must be thankful that pkr offered its platform for me to reveal the real situation especially in permatang pauh
7448063 they hypocrites have made their oaths a screen for their misdeeds thus they obstruct men from the path of allah truly evil are their deeds
7448064 dont obey the type of despicable men ready with oaths
7448065 ini adalah hari paling gembira buat saya kerana pada akhirnya saya akan dapat jumpa anwar di mahkamah
7448066 najib has to bath the milk of a thousand cows before he can become the pm of malaysia

7448069 ramlangs revelation that cast doubt over the recent saiful swearing
7448070 but the fact remains saiful is not lying in his swearing he said it in allahs name
7448071 the malaysian insider understands that the tests were conducted on several samples from the underwear and body parts a few days after saiful lodged a police report on june 28 the tests allegedly confirm that the dna on the samples belonged to saiful and anwar

7448081 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7448082 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7448083 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7448085 if there is an opportunity here we have to look at it
7448086 we are saying this is the one place they should leave alone
7448087 it is an incredibly diverse and productive place we have fish and shellfish spawning 12 months a year there is nothing else like it
7448088 to throw oil development on top of this now is particularly maddening
7448089 we look forward to further developing a positive relationship with the province and the fishermen to ensure nova scotias offshore resources are developed responsibly and to their full potential
7448090 the fishing is not like it was people are leaving to find work we need new types of industry
7448091 im not saying yes but i am open to looking at it
7448092 adding oil and gas into the mix diminishes our chances
7448093 the convention is a real opportunity to reintroduce barack obama to the american people
7448094 i dont buy that theres been a lack of specificity on his part but the conventions a great opportunity to specify and refine things and make the stakes absolutely clear
7448095 are you going to present this guy who can govern across the middle or is he the guy whos going to modernize reform and bring up to date traditional democratic values
7448096 hes got to define himself because one of the jobs of the republican convention is to define barack obama
7448097 there isnt an area of public policy that this administration has not failed in and the country can not take four more years of it
7448098 that point will be made over and over again there are two paths to the future one is more of the same the other is the path that barack obama represents
7448099 if he cant get that arena hell have a difficult time getting elected
7448100 the elites and the mass public can be on a different wavelength
7448101 theres a real disconnect between whats left of the hillary people in the hall and the hillary people out in the country
7448102 she is fully behind the obama campaign and now her followers need to follow her
7448103 its always tougher to drag your staff and your supporters because theyve been emotionally thrown so much its going to take a rousing speech
7448104 to some extent voters in these states are electing people with that bipartisan approach and pragmatic problem solving
7448105 will it hurt the democrats to be partisan no but barack obama has had a different way of doing politics and i think that will continue
7448106 its like a political convention with this dash of community organizing thrown in
7448107 i smoke like this because i want to keep my weight down
7448108 after i get married ill stop and just get real fat
7448109 the sort of talk was you know what made him get so serious all the sudden
7448110 said kent goss an occidental classmate who played basketball with him
7448111 junkie pothead thats where id been headed the final fatal role of the young would be black man
7448112 when he surfaced as this national figure i can only remember him wearing o p shorts and flip flops
7448113 we were giving him a lot of grief about being from hawaii and being from punahou and he was giving it back
7448114 skilled at finding a connection and making that an initial foundation of friendship
7448115 he was not a philosopher king sitting there opining on the world for the rest of us as we sat there open mouthed
7448116 barry would kind of hang back and there would be some less sophisticated people who would be yelling their point of view or argument and barry would kind of come in and just kind of part the waters he would bring clarity that would address both sides of the argument and substantiate his point
7448117 upstairs i could hear someone flushing a toilet walking across the room another insomniac probably listening to his life tick away
7448118 i didnt see him ever being on the fringe he seemed very centered and settled
7448119 you find people on both sides who dont appreciate it
7448120 i remember talking about the vicious circle between self segregation and segregation imposed upon you
7448121 coming here was hard for me a lot of things that i knew as a black student that i knew as a black period werent accepted on this campus
7448122 what i remember is all the number of questions he would ask and they were all good questions
7448123 he was the kind of student that comes along and you say oh i wish i had written that or thought of that
7448124 theyve got this powerful personality theyre interested in all the courses and ideas and you start realizing theyre going to do something special he was gestating a little more slowly
7448125 obama as an undergraduate in my mind demonstrated that he was a serious talented thoughtful person who had concerns beyond himself
7448126 there was a lot of stuff going on in me
7448127 by the end of that year at occidental i think i was starting to work it through and i think part of the attraction of transferring was its hard to remake yourself around people who have known you for a long time
7448128 that didnt make sense to me because the other black students who were leaving were leaving because it wasnt black enough
7448129 i sort of felt that he felt part of the program and part of the school his freshman year
7448130 i think he felt less that way as a sophomore
7448131 he wasnt talking about becoming the leader of the free world
7448132 he was talking about i felt being a responsible citizen a lot of us were like that at oxy you were kind of turned on to doing something with your life
7448133 that accident was an accident it was two boats making contact in the night
7448134 there are those who want maines lakes to be like on golden pond and there are other groups who want them to race speedboats on
7448135 and when you have these two user groups come together theres going to be a huge confrontation
7448136 you see them going by 60 70 miles per hour in limited visibility and thats what happened here
7448137 the guy had too much to drink the boat was going so fast youve got to have fast reflexes and he sliced them in half i dont know why it doesnt happen more often
7448138 everyone would stare at you because you had a speedboat and you hadnt done anything wrong
7448139 some of them do tend to come up and not embrace the whole small town living thing
7448140 they find it hard to leave city life behind the whole life in the slow lane they dont get it and thats why you come up here for peace and tranquillity
7448141 youve awaken us finally fools and offered us eternal reign night and day we will turn into red and as we are here we will stay
7448142 a bell is not a bell till you ring it

7448148 ugh ok sorry mysterious voice inside my head that just so happened to be telling the truth that fang was not dead because it was just a dream that drove me to yell at squirrels with hearbeats
7448149 because it had a heartbeat you see in my dream i had a dream that you were just overly paralyzed not dead like i was when they let me out of that black box i woke up and you were still dead voice told me that the dream had the truth so we went to your grave we listened for a heartbeat in the ground heard one and it was a stupid squirrel i lost my temper and yelled at the squirrel iggy called me masochistic i said the voice made me seem masochistic and yelled at the voice and then i woke up saw you were alive pinched myself hugged you kissed you told you about my dream apologized to the voice told you more about my dream adn then made this list for you

7448159 das kann man jedoch verhindern wenn die hauterkrankung rechtzeitig erkannt wird
7448160 denn hauterkrankungen entstehen meist ber einen l ngeren zeitraum erste anzeichen sind eine trockene und raue haut r tungen und juckreiz wer diese symptome beobachtet sollte einen hautarzt aufsuchen und auf eine m gliche berufliche ursache hinweisen
7448161 nat rlich ist der beste schutz den kontakt zum gefahrstoff zu vermeiden
7448162 da dies jedoch nicht immer m glich ist sollten die arbeitnehmer dringend den hautschutzplan beachten
7448163 in diesem fall hilft es zus tzliche hautschutzmittel aufzutragen oder einen baumwollhandschuh unter den feuchtigkeitsdichten handschuh anzuziehen

7448176 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7448177 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7448178 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7448179 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7448180 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees

7448203 there there its just a nightmare its not gonna happen
7448204 nick du hast viele titel und rennen vor der formel 1 gewonnen seit neun jahren wartest du aber auf den sieg wie frustrierend ist das
7448205 das ist nicht einfach aber man muss realistisch bleiben und mit dem zurechtkommen was man hat die beste chance auf einen rennsieg hatte ich in diesem jahr in kanada in meinem kopf ist das rennen so als h tte ich dort gewinnen sollen aber in den anderen rennen hatte ich ja keine chance vielleicht noch in china im vorjahr da hatte ich im regen eine gute strategie aber es gab ein technisches problem ich denke da aber nicht st ndig dr ber nach ich gebe einfach mein bestes wenn sich die chance dann ergibt werde ich es auch schaffen
7448206 ich hatte gehofft dass ich f r mclaren starten darf
7448207 als mercedes sch tzling in die formel 1 doch dann ging es nicht wie gedacht weiter wir war das
7448208 das war nicht einfach denn ich hatte gehofft dass ich f r mclaren starten darf ich hatte einen langfristigen vertrag mit ihnen und konnte mit ihrer unterst tzung titel in kleineren serien gewinnen dann w hlten sie kimi r ikk nen anm d red er ist nun weltmeister und geh rt zu den besten fahrern aber auch wenn es schwierig war so sorgte das mental nicht f r probleme bei mir ich habe das einfach akzeptiert habe nach vorne geschaut und versucht das beste zu geben nun bin ich mit bmw in einem topteam und habe k nftig hoffentlich die chance die meisterschaft zu gewinnen
7448209 es ist schon komisch dass dich mercedes nicht nahm bmw dann schon spielte dabei eine rolle dass du deutscher bist war das f r dich wichtig
7448210 ich glaube nicht dass das deswegen war weil ich deutscher bin ich war schon mit bmw zusammen als ich noch bei williams war ich hatte ja das shootout gegen pizzonia und da war ich ja nun nicht der favorit ich habe meinen platz also verdient in diesem jahr war es nicht perfekt aber in den vergangenen acht jahren schlug ich meinen teamkollegen im vorjahr hatte ich eine starke saison nun ist es nicht perfekt aber das passiert und es wird besser
7448211 ich komme mit druck ziemlich gut zurecht die situation in der ich mich in dieser saison befinde ist aber auch neu f r mich bei allem was in der formel 1 zuvor kam kann ich sagen dass es nicht an meinen leistungen lag 2003 musste ich bei sauber gehen weil sie dort unbedingt fisi giancarlo fisichella wollten ich schlug auch felipe massa anm d red aber er blieb bei sauber im jordan zeigte ich gute leistungen und dann auch bei williams
7448212 es hat sich mehr ge ndert als in den drei jahren zuvor
7448213 wie war es dann bei deiner r ckkehr zu sauber war alles vertraut oder f hlte es sich an als w rdest du zu einem anderen team kommen
7448214 nein es war im prinzip dasselbe team auch wenn ich weg war so hatte ich irgendwie immer das gef hl dass ich eines tages wieder mit diesem team zusammen sein w rde ich wei nicht warum das so war das war nur ein gef hl als ich dann wieder im team war kannte ich 95 prozent der leute dort eine paar monate sp ter bernahm bmw das team und es hat sich mehr ge ndert als in den drei jahren zuvor so viele neue leute kamen
7448215 f r 2009 hast du noch keinen neuen vertrag wie denkst du generell ber deine zukunft in der formel 1

7448685 department of foreign affairs allegedly cited a report by philippine ambassador to singapore belen fule anota which revealed 212 cases of human trafficking in 2007 represented a 70 percent increase from the 125 cases in 2006 likewise the embassy handled in 2007 the highest number of trafficking cases since it started monitoring these cases three years ago when there were only 59 cases reported

7448691 snakes may be prevented by natural selection from becoming too small because below a certain size there may be nothing for their young to eat
7448692 if a tiny snake were to have two offspring each egg could occupy only half the space that is devoted to reproduction within its body
7448693 but then each of the two hatchlings would be half the normal size perhaps too small to function as a snake or in the environment
7448694 the fact that tiny snakes produce only one massive egg relative to the size of the mother suggests that natural selection is trying to keep the size of hatchlings above a critical limit in order to survive

7448698 to my understanding the koran does not place a limit and it is up to what your own power your own endowment and ability allows
7448699 god did not say what the punishment should be for a man who has more than four wives but he was specific about the punishment for fornication and adultery

7448718 lunica differenza che le scene dazione non ci sono nel libro che scritto dal punto di vista di bella e spesso bella svenuta o non capisce cosa succede perch i vampiri si muovono velocissimi invece nel film lazione visibile
7448719 no affatto ho sempre visto molti film americani quindi in un certo senso se reciti in un film sembra pi naturale adottare quellaccento ti d pi limpressione di star recitando di interpretare qualcuno che non sei tu
7448720 e facile trasformarli in un clich visto tutti i libri e i film sui vampiri degli ultimi centanni ma questi non sono vampiri convenzionali non ne hanno laspetto e non muoiono allo stesso modo quindi ho cercato di semplificare al massimo ti mordono e diventi anche tu un vampiro diventi immortale e hai una forza sovrumana eccetera e neppure tu sai il perch

7448736 the artwork is lame and repetitive the jokes are either inside software industry jokes or thinly disguised anti capitalist rantings
7448737 are there really 80 people who find any reference to microsoft in a web comic funny
7448738 why has this been running since 1996 who actually reads it who is the idiot who reads it every day and posts the good ones up on reddit doesnt he realize he is wasting his time
7448739 my god my eyes are bleeding now to think that there are comics out there which are worse than user friendly is every way when user friendly was already pretty bottom of the barrel in all departments
7448740 it actually took us a really long time to write 17 pages
7448741 but we had never done a film before and we had a story to tell and we both wanted a challenge in our lives as we approached a certain age
7448742 but filming it is another thing and we didnt realize wed set ourselves a monumental challenge its funny though when we started to tell people wed actually written this film a comedy about grief some people looked alarmed i guess because theyre afraid of a grief thats too terrible to laugh at but most of the women we spoke to had a look of instant recognition on their face their response was just to burst into laughter that was really interesting
7448743 the moments when the penny drops when a decision is made when something becomes clear or maybe a little too clear
7448744 these people are all doing something new for the first time theyre all slightly nervous but it was wonderful watching people take those leaps of faith
7448745 it was inspiring to watch people learning from others ultimately we hope this project inspires other people of any age to try something new
7448746 our little film how are you is really a film full of recognizable moments and when we were making it we kept hearing from people like our producer sonya di rienzo flamenco at 5 15 or the sound person or someone in makeup or hair who said they would love to make a film about a pivotal life changing moment and we started to think wouldnt it be a great idea for all these people to work on individual films and then parcel them together in a mosaic that reflects real life moments of enlightenment amongst the filmmakers
7448747 the difficulty of short films of course is that the ramp up is so huge for three days of filming
7448748 to get a whole film crew together and raise the money the idea here is to pool our resources and be able to film the shorts over two weeks using the same director of photography david franco and the same crew so it seems like a smart idea actually just the process of filling out applications is so daunting for some people the producers in our group are able to help with that it just helps people get up to speed much faster
7448749 they say everyone has a novel in them but not many people have time to write a novel
7448750 but i actually think everyone has a short film in them making it however is a very difficult discipline to narrow it down to 10 minutes or three has its own challenges this is an opportunity to really get this kind of experience in microcosm
7448751 how are you evolved out of conversations we shared with each other our friends and acquaintances we decided to take the leap into unknown territory for the simple reason weve reached an age and point in our lives when we needed a new challenge
7448752 this film is about a certain kind of grief that we all have to deal with at a certain age
7448753 when youre in your 20s you think wow thats not going to happen to me but then we reach a certain age maybe its your 30s or your 40s when you realize oh im part of that too grief is now part of my story so how are you is about a turning point where you have to figure out how to go forward from here
7448754 shorts often end up just being seen by people who go to film festivals or film school

7448764 corpo proprio di una persona e soprattutto della sua superficie come luogo da cui possono sgorgare percezioni interne ed esterne
7448765 avere un corpo vuol dire essere guardati guardarsi essere visibile

7448768 lo deve anche distinguere dalla seduzione sia da parte del malato che da parte sua la seduzione a servizio del narcisismo nega la comunicazione e tende a svilupparsi come transfert erotico falso transfert positivo questultima situazione non controllata ed elaborata pu acquistare carattere di relazione perversa
7448769 ogni psicotico cerca di risvegliare nellanalista il proprio narcisismo e le sue tendenze onnipotenti e di indurre in lui la disponibilit a personificare il suo ideale dellio per far ci egli fa uso della seduzione e cerca di convincerlo che il suo delirio il suo sragionare ragionevole e degno di ammirazione il problema si pone quando c una coincidenza tra linduzione del paziente e la proiezione narcisistica dellanalista stesso il quale a causa della sua visione personale e idealizzata della malattia la disconosce invece di riconoscerla nella sua complessit e nel suo valore intrinseco lio narcisista infantile accattivato dellanalista si perde nellaltro come narciso

7448772 surely the lord is in this place and i did not know it

7448778 do you believe because i told you that i saw you under the fig tree you will see greater things than these
7448779 very truly i tell you you will see heaven opened and the angels of god ascending and descending upon the son of man
7448780 so i suppose this means should vote for you and not the hot surfer guy

7448782 as we felt new power flow in as we enjoyed peace of mind as we discovered we could face life successfully as we became conscious of his presence we began to lose our fear of today tomorrow or the hereafter we were reborn
7448783 the concept of energy and the flow of that energy in the human body is the core of the current explosion in healing
7448784 we had a new employer being all powerful he provided what we needed if we kept close to him and performed his work well established on such a footing we became less and less interested in ourselves our little plans and designs more and more we became interested in seeing what we could contribute to life
7448785 rep clack is not just the chair of this committee but she is also the chair of the michigan legislative black caucus you would think as screwed up as the black family is in this state that she would have got this bill out of committee a long time ago
7448786 why is your state representative brenda clack holding up hb 4564 in her committee
7448787 why is brenda clack holding the numerous benefits of this bill hostage in her committee
7448788 today it is clear that after georgias aggression against south ossetia that georgian south ossetian and georgian abkhazian relations cannot be returned to their former state
7448789 the peoples of south ossetia and abkhazia have the right to get independence
7448790 we will look today at the appeals from the peoples of abkhazia and south ossetia to recognise the independence of these republics i think that all these decisions will be accepted
7448791 getting a ceasefire stopping hostilities and the troop withdrawal in eight days thats quite a lot already well have to see we have to take stock of the situation
7448792 but in truth we lost the chance of outright victory yesterday in qualifying in my view its pretty clear that if lewis had qualified with the same level of fuel as felipe hed probably have been able to control the race from the front
7448793 i think throughout the race they seemed to show a little bit more pace on the longer stints i think we stayed pretty close in the first stint but i think towards the end he was edging away a little bit
7448794 this looks like a step backward for obama who had a 51 to 44 percent advantage last month
7448795 even last week just before his choice of joe biden as his running mate became known most polls tended to show obama with a single digit advantage over mccain
7448796 the number of clinton democrats who say they would vote for mccain has gone up 11 points since june enough to account for most although not all of the support mccain has gained in that time

7448820 i dont care to poison the well but the one exception to all of this will probably come from canadian backpackers who go to considerable lengths to distinguish themselves from americans and to elevate themselves above us with a personal form of anti americanism that is largely absent from just about everyone else if you run across this and if you are hosteling you probably will at some point or another just ignore them and find other people to hang out with

7448835 barack obamas father was muslim and therefore according to islamic law so is the candidate in spite of the quranic verses explaining that there is no compulsion in religion a muslim child takes the religion of his or her father for muslims around the world non american muslims at any rate they can only ever see barack hussein obama as a muslim

7448838 the symbolism of a major american presidential candidate with the middle name of hussein who went to elementary school in indonesia
7448839 dont really understand obamas family tree but what they do know is that if america despite being attacked by muslim militants on 9 11 were to elect as its president some guy with the middle name hussein it would mark a sea change in america muslim world relations

7448860 what i said to the team was to put it to the back of our minds because the most important thing for us is the one day series with south africa and that means standing up to be counted on tuesday
7448861 this is a huge decision and cricket can now take priority again
7448862 its a great result for all the players to find out whether were going or not going
7448863 by postponing the tournament until october next year there is time for the security situation in pakistan to improve or for a suitable alternative venue to be chosen
7448864 i dont know how they can possibly reschedule it because you have to have a window of opportunity for all the cricketing nations to be available to play at a given stage next year
7448865 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7448866 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7448867 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7448868 especially in of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7448869 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7448870 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7448871 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7448872 they have arrested one of our mps here in the chamber
7448873 whether buying or selling the lease option really works for buyers and sellers
7448874 looking for new cabinet doorknobs drawer pulls there are plenty of options to choose from
7448875 there is a wide variety of design styles and prices
7448876 these accents customize your cabinetry for a look that reflects your personal style the total for this hardware depends a great deal on the size of your kitchen and how many doors and drawers in it
7448877 anyone looking for kitchen hardware should consider style color and the rest of the space to coordinate with what already exists in it such as lighting and faucets
7448878 look for something thats going to last you want something thats not going to look dated in a few years but if you want to be trendy pick less expensive pieces
7448879 its a good idea to make sure you find something that feels good in the hand some people refer to this cabinet hardware as kitchen jewelry because it is the finishing touch to the space
7448880 pick something that meets your needs get something you can live with make sure you like the feel of it on the cabinet door if you arent sure about what will look and feel right in your kitchen or bath sometimes it is possible to take samples home
7448881 whether you are looking for something to suit a modern traditional or country home you will likely find something to suit your design preferences
7448882 kitchen cabinet refacing is the affordable hassle free efficient way to boost your homes value while also realizing the kitchen of your dreams a kitchen cabinet refacing project can do more than just give your kitchen
7448883 why is it so important for an artist to learn sketching
7448884 you are a pigeon wow power leveling youll walk around the graveyard in this cold but you dare not cross it
7448885 the graveyard is nothing to cross captain it is nothing but earth like all the other earth
7448886 first you wanted to learn horse riding then dancing then swimming
7448887 this is what ill do ill pay for you to have lessons for six weeks at the end of six weeks you must play something for me if you play well you can have more lessons if you play badly i will stop the lessons
7448888 i have a lot of respect for crouch and defoe
7448889 they are good players and will score a lot of goals this year especially at home
7448890 crouch is tall and wins most things in the air and defoe is very quick around the box he is a sharp player who makes problems for defenders
7448891 but as defenders we are here to deal with situations like that
7448892 we know who we are playing against so we need to prepare properly because it is very important we get the three points
7448893 we have started badly but it is a long season and we have plenty of time to put it right portsmouth will want to show they are not as bad as they looked last week but we will be ready
7448894 i am not saying portsmouth are bad but when it is one of the top teams the community shield is like a derby and you really want to win
7448895 it is only two games if it was the last games of the season maybe there would be pressure but now no
7448896 i think teams have time now to lose some points
7448897 i understand that we didnt play like last week but i also understand the reasons why
7448898 but they fought and it was possible to win the game it is fantastic for chelsea and fantastic for our group because we have confidence and we have six points
7448899 in my eyes yes we did enough i think most people who witnessed it would say that too
7448900 but they have given everything when you play these big teams sometimes you have to ride your luck we didnt have to do that because we played well against them
7448901 when you analyse it our goalkeeper didnt have a save to make thats almost unheard of against
7448902 for me robinho is the same player as always he is an important player who should be part of this project
7448903 i think that he knows that he can be successful at real madrid it is a subject that you need to resolve in the best way possible but we are all selfish and the best would be that he stays with us for a long time
7448904 without doubt its not a comfortable situation either for him or for us
7448905 he continues with the team because we are going to see what happens we need to think that he could also remain with the team this season
7448906 his declarations have been inopportune but nobody is going to be kept at the club against their will
7448907 the upcoming democratic national convention is generating much more public interest than did the partys convention four years ago fully 59 of americans say they are interested in following what happens at the democratic convention up from 36 in 2004
7448908 joel brinkley came to visit me on 14 august to tell me that he wished to write articles on education the economy land dispute problems and the government political vision
7448909 i proposed to him to put him in contact with say chhum the cpp secretary general with im chhunlim the minister of land management with im sothy the state secretary of education with chum bunrong the spokesman for the national authority for resolution of land disputes and with phay siphan the spokesman of the council of ministers
7448910 joel brinkley told me that he was pulitzer prize winner and that he wished to meet high ranking vips
7448911 this goes to the whole culture of impunity here who you are who you know is more important than following the law
7448912 i have worked in many corrupt states iraq sudan afghanistan among others but in none of them is the corruption so pervasive even pandemic

7448915 remember children are born with a decided bias towards evil and therefore if you let them choose for themselves they are certain to choose wrong
7448916 kindness gentleness long suffering forbearance patience sympathy a willingness to enter into childish troubles a readiness to take part in childish joys these are the cords by which a child may be led most easily these are the clues you must follow if you would find the way to his heart
7448917 try hard to keep up a hold on your childs affections it is a dangerous thing to make your children afraid of you
7448918 we depend in a vast measure on those who bring us up we get from them a colour a taste a bias which cling to us more or less all our lives
7448919 precious no doubt are these little ones in your eyes but if you love them think often of their souls

7448921 they have made us proud through their inspiring and courageous achievements in beijing now it is our turn to show our appreciation
7448922 i want the athletes to look out across a sea of welsh flags and for the cheers to be heard in weston super mare
7448923 the selection of the millennium stadium as an olympic venue is a great honour for the whole of wales
7448924 i was privileged to represent my country at the olympics and then to go on to play rugby for wales so this has a special relevance to me
7448925 weve seen from the success of beijing that the whole world watches when the olympics is taking place
7448926 the eyes of the world will be on wales in 2012 and the millennium stadium will be a proud symbol of our nation for the world to see

7448943 all the players i know personally from other countries have safety and security concerns
7448944 it was good that this decision was taken out of our players hands
7448945 over the last couple of weeks it has been a huge topic of conversation in the dressing room
7448946 and last sundays briefing was a huge talking point this whole week there has been ifs and buts and dos and donts
7448947 what i said to the team was to put it to the back of our minds because the most important thing for us is the one day series with south africa and that means standing up to be counted on tuesday
7448948 this is a huge decision and cricket can now take priority again
7448949 its a great result for all the players to find out whether were going or not going
7448950 by postponing the tournament until october next year there is time for the security situation in pakistan to improve or for a suitable alternative venue to be chosen
7448951 i dont know how they can possibly reschedule it because you have to have a window of opportunity for all the cricketing nations to be available to play at a given stage next year
7448952 siapakah yang layak dipilih dalam keadaan begitu bagi saya pengundi yang matang hendaklah menilai manakah pihak yang paling ringan mudaratnya dibandingkan yang satu lagi

7448954 walaupun dia tidak rela memotong anggotanya namun jika dibiarkan akan menyebabkan maut maka dia terpaksa memilih keadaan yang lebih ringan antara keduanya

7448960 schon bevor sie da hingegangen sind haben sie einiges gesagt was zu dem gepasst hat was sie dann auch in china erz hlt haben das war meines erachtens zu nachsichtig und zu unpr zise also wer sagt dass internetseiten auch bei uns gesperrt werden wenn sie kinderpornografie oder rechtsextremistische gewaltaufrufe enthalten und das vergleicht mit dem sperren von seiten der deutschen welle oder von amnesty international dem sind die ganzen politischen kriterien verrutscht

7448970 mi ritiro dopo i mondiali 2009 sto con il popolo tibetano ma noi atleti possiamo fare poco e in tv io ci vado soltanto per promuovere la boxe
7448971 far piangere i cinesi salgo sul ring per prendermi loro
7448972 mi sono svegliato bene rilassato ho spedito le ultime cartoline e sono andato a rivedere lincontro del cinese nei quarti contro il marocchino amanissi un po di tecnica la borsa il pranzo e via al palasport
7448973 ci sono rimasto male quasi sentivo lansia di dover riscattare tutto e tutti
7448974 tranquillo sono salito per prendermi loro ed entrare nella storia ci sono riuscito lavevo pronosticato arrivando qui ho visto e ho vinto
7448975 il cinese andato gi come volevo lambiente contro mi ha galvanizzato e poi un campione del mondo viene qui per vincere
7448976 lei non contenta quando sto troppo tempo fuori casa salutandola le ho detto che andavo in cina per loro e lei se non lo prendi ho dovuto vincere per forza io non deludo ho messo il punto esclamativo alla carriera
7448977 ho sempre pensato se vinco loro salto fino al giorno dopo poi mi dicevo non ce la far a saltare cos tanto ora sono felice anche di tornare a casa
7448978 questoro un messaggio per quanti vanno in palestra campioni e no e spero che siano sempre di pi la boxe una scuola di vita i pugni si danno e si prendono devi cercare di prenderne meno
7448979 intanto sono il primo italiano sul podio in due olimpiadi poi sono cresciuto ho patito problemi alla schiena e anche per questo dopo i mondiali di milano a casa nel 2009 penso che mi ritirer ora mi concedo una vacanza alle maldive
7448980 a casa siamo tutti convinti e a proposito non siamo di origini campane semmai lucane dunque i miei vengono dal profondo sud io sono nato a milano e ora risiedo al centro penso di rappresentare litalia intera
7448981 e un mondo che non mi appartiene vi assicuro che vincere tra i dilettanti non affatto facile e poi un ambiente straordinario
7448982 avevo 11 anni per dimagrire poi sfidavo anche mio fratello antonio a casa
7448983 s perch faceva anche lui il supermassimo le sue critiche dopo il brutto match nei quarti contro il colombiano rivas mi sono servite per svoltare
7448984 eppure io sono un tecnico amo vincere per differenza punti sono state le situazioni a provocare questi risultati
7448985 no al professionismo no ai reality tv in tv ci vado solo per promuovere la boxe
7448986 che tutti sono fieri di me anchio mi diverto ancora alla palestra di spinaceto e con i compagni andiamo in pullmino ai campionati italiani
7448987 anchio sono vicino al popolo tibetano i problemi esistevano prima ed esisteranno dopo perch gli atleti possono fare poco abbiamo fatto solo un po di luce
7448988 c spazio per tutti e due la boxe ha bisogno di personaggi e ora io sono felice volevo vincere ho stravinto

7449292 nobody likes to reverse one and ive been involved with some in pretty big situations like that but when you get the call right everyones behind you the media and the teams on the field
7449293 if aybars got the ball theres no obstruction you protect the fielder when hes in the act of fielding once that balls released and out of his hand he has to vacate
7449294 him and i will be linked forever because of that one play and now theres two plays
7449295 i would love to get that record im not going to lie to you

7449300 you just had the feeling getting out of that jam right there we were going to win the ball game in the bottom half of the inning

7449348 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7449349 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7449350 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7449351 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint

7449371 the majority of the increase in commodities over the last five years has been driven by demand from china and the emerging economies being so great that supplies havent been able to keep up

7449462 im afraid it will not be very easy for the government to answer all the questions
7449463 it was impossible to imagine that russian tanks would be 20 25 minutes drive from tbilisi that we would have so many refugees and displaced persons and so many casualties among civilians
7449464 saakashvili was personally responsible for the military operation and for starting a war we could not win
7449465 today when russian tanks are rolling on the georgian territory on the most part of its territory we need unity firmness and our enemies should never see political tensions in the country
7449466 our position is that russian tanks should leave georgia and afterwards discussions will start over who is responsible for what has happened
7449467 we moved one brigade of the georgian armed forces closer to south ossetia and later another brigade as well
7449468 but our major forces were still deployed in the west there was a brigade at senaki military base and we did not call back our brigade from iraq because i was deeply convinced up to the last minute that russia would not have done such a large scale provocation
7449469 although we were under fire from the 120mm mortar launchers i announced a unilateral ceasefire at that time we already had one killed soldiers in the village of avnevi and four others were wounded georgian defense minister davit kezerashvili was begging me to let him open artillery fire because he was telling me otherwise he was not able to bring wounded soldiers from the village but my response was that we could not open fire whatever happened
7449470 so the only way to stop their russian forces and south ossetian militias movement into the georgian villages was to use medium size artillery for blowing up the bridge at didi gupta and for closing the road coming from roki tunnel so as soon as they the russian tanks started to roll into south ossetia we started firing to the road at roki tunnel at the same time we were responding to the fire coming from the south ossetian positions including from the center of tskhinvali their government headquarters and from their defense ministry
7449471 we conducted our first flight apparently by su 25 warplanes available in the georgian army at dawn august 8 in direction of java and roki tunnel and our pilots informed us that whole area was full of the russian military
7449472 if someone thinks that it was georgia which triggered what had happened should better realize how it was possible to bring in such large army only in hours this is unreal
7449473 when we are asking our western partners did not you see them coming they are responding that their satellites were directed mainly on iraq and that they could not fly over georgia but it was impossible to see what was happening on the ground because it was cloudy so it was a serious failure of the international intelligence they would not have hidden this information from us if they knew it but they also did not know it
7449474 large part of this russian military in java during the early stage of the conflict
7449475 the 4th brigade and the military unit from kojori have destroyed hundreds of soldiers and gen anatoly khrulev a commander of russias 58th army was wounded after that putin arrived in vladikavkaz mobilizes entire forces and russias entire forces moved towards georgia russians conducted 200 combat flights
7449476 we managed to stop them on the first day on the second day and on the third day 500 more armored vehicles started moving into georgia from roki tunnel
7449477 so we took that decision to pull back this was the time when the world started waking up
7449478 one hour after the president bushs statement russian tanks stopped rolling in direction of tbilisi
7449479 to collapse the georgias economy to trigger chaos and as a result to put an end to the georgian statehood

7449488 they want to stop the law enforcement activities but at the same time they continue to coddle and harbor those who committed atrocities not condemning it outright and this adds to the severe credibility problem which already faces the milf
7449489 i still do not want to stereotype each and every person of the milf as a coddler of atrocities or what not there is still some hope however be that as it may the unbargainable condition is that we will number one run after the perpetrators of the atrocities and second we will prevent a recurrence of these atrocities

7449491 to tell you the truth i had no idea how it is supposed to be spelled
7449492 what is very significant is that our government troops have caught up with all the base commands or groups responsible for the various atrocities in the last few days
7449493 these are their battle positions and temporary encampments the most significant of which is camp vietnam
7449494 our intelligence reports point to the fact that the group is there and the commanders themselves are with the group
7449495 you can make that conclusion we have made some substantial gains

7449500 but after november 1 2008 all those who fail to return the money will be prosecuted as for the other nine firms for which the committee was still seeking interpols help we will have to wait until such time that the police get the necessary information in order for further action to be taken against them
7449501 it appears that more importance is being placed on individual rights than national interests there is no such thing as the human rights of an individual involved in economic sabotage being violated
7449502 government of the people by the people and for the people
7449503 its time for a change i may be old but i am an old person who believes in young ideas
7449504 i was probably the most visible hillary supporter there was
7449505 she didnt win i can accept that and i think most people are accepting that
7449506 bottom line we as a party cant afford another bush kind of term
7449507 i liked hillary i saw what she went through with the republicans and she didnt cave in
7449508 but i am not about to vote republican because she isnt the nominee
7449509 we are perturbed at the lack of interest by city management in cleaning up vacant buildings
7449510 the council has said they didnt want to have layoffs but personnel is 83 percent of the police departments budget
7449511 if the departments can cut their budgets a minimum of 5 percent maybe we can use reserves to stem the tide a while until we get a handle of whats going on
7449512 the council has eliminated some items and added others that werent included in the budget
7449513 were also looking at water and garbage rates park rentals and other fees
7449514 we have to win games and be there at the end winning the al east
7449515 warrior campaign includes music from kid rock and features dale earnhardt jr the national guard sponsored
7449516 l quipe de campagne de john mccain a protest avec vigueur dimanche contre madonna apr s une mise en sc ne dun concert de la chanteuse qui semblait comparer le candidat r publicain la maison blanche adolf hitler et au pr sident zimbabw en robert mugabe
7449517 les comparaisons sont tout la fois scandaleuses inacceptables et de nature diviser
7449518 cela montre clairement que lorsquil sagit de soutenir barack obama ses amies les c l brit s mondiales nh sitent pas avoir recours des d nigrements et des attaques inacceptables
7449519 il y a un ras le bol des salari s
7449520 si tu nas pas ce que tu aimes aime ce que tu as
7449521 il y a un ras le bol des salari s
7449522 a fresh new voice with a great new cd great production soaring vocals
7449523 my gospel and jazz music albums will be on sale at the venue of the concert
7449524 il pensait que la question p dophile existe et que certains gays sont p dophobes et consid rent que l mancipation des homosexuels se fera sur le dos des p dophiles on a invent un homosexuel qui laisse de c t la question p dophile estimait il
7449525 this is going to be catastrophic for millions of people
7449526 suggests that battle for the presidency between the illinois senator and republican rival john mccain is all tied up
7449527 typical of the pro obama dungeons amp dragons crowd from the comfort of moms basement
7449528 naturally gamers are not amused by the mccain campaigns quick resort to 80s era cultural stereotypes once mccain masters the internet were confident hell contemporize and start bashing video gamers instead
7449529 wields a fox cloak of deception with a 10 stun against nearby intelligent creatures
7449530 government is like a big baby an alimentary canal with a big appetite at one end and no sense of responsibility at the other
7449531 the systems that generate elections and earthquakes are complex systems
7449532 they are not predictable by simple equations but after coarse graining averaging they become predictable
7449533 we didnt look at it as reagan versus carter or republicans versus democrats or liberals versus conservatives rather we looked at elections as stability versus upheavals
7449534 a religious war going on in our country for the soul of america it is a cultural war
7449535 hello george this is ron reagan id like to go over to the convention and announce that youre my choice for vice president if thats alright with you
7449536 this organization is a terrorist organization and created mayhem against the public life so we decided to declare it banned
7449537 shook his fist in wrath as he walked the platform a white foam gathered upon his lips giving him a look of ferocity
7449538 does mr lincoln wish to push these things to the point of personal difficulties here douglas demanded backing around and shaking his clenched fist within a few inches of lincolns face
7449539 made him look like humpty dumpty in a toupee while lincolns height was largely in his legs and gave audiences the impression of a scarecrow come to life
7449540 this government was made by our fathers on the white basis
7449541 by white men for the benefit of white men and their posterity forever
7449542 when lincoln rose to take the oath and discovered that he had no place to rest his top hat douglas obligingly stepped forward and held it for him
7449543 a sad heart with a grief that i have never before experienced
7449544 family is shaping the content of the entire day and thats not been done before
7449545 he let me know the world was large and that i should get to know as much of it as possible
7449546 they want to contrast the story of obama who has been through struggles that many americans are now facing with mccain who seems increasingly out of touch
7449547 filled with black rage against white people and hatred of the united states
7449548 the challenge is to avoid anything that smacks of angry black woman and get her back into the kitchen the question is whether she is willing to go along with that
7449549 she is bright and she is gifted but she also has a healthily ordinary attitude towards her family that american voters will respond to
7449550 make people aware of the kind of sacrifice barack made to give a voice to people who had all but given up hope
7449551 a group or a member of such a group or class enjoying intellectual social or economic status the best or most skilled members of a group
7449552 the belief that certain persons or members of certain classes or groups deserve favored treatment by virtue of their perceived superiority the sense of entitlement enjoyed by such a group
7449553 pointy headed intellectuals who cant even ride a bike straight
7449554 im from a military family ive moved around a lot actually the place i lived longest was in hanoi
7449555 a political gaffe it is said occurs when a politician inadvertently tells the truth
7449556 last night biden wanted to leave his driveway and drive straight to the white house and tell bush paraphrasing that he knows what the world needs
7449557 i dont know if you are aware that i am a decorated vietnam war veteran
7449558 for decades he has brought change to washington but washington hasnt changed him
7449559 ladies and gentlemen your kitchen table is like mine you sit there at night after you put the kids to bed and you talk you talk about what you need you talk about how much you are worried about being able to pay the bills well ladies and gentlemen thats not a worry john mccain has to worry about hell have to figure out which of the seven kitchen tables to sit at
7449560 i know that joe will campaign well for senator obama and so i think hes going to be very formidable
7449561 ive always respected joe biden but i disagreed with him from the time he voted against the first gulf war to his position where he said you had to break iraq up into three different countries we really have different approaches to many national security issues
7449562 mccain competing in blue states obama is competing in red states they are rewriting history every single day
7449563 we dont want to go back to tomorrow we want to go forward
7449564 ive spoken to kerry about his situation and hes publicly stated he wants to stay at the west coast eagles and hes contracted to the football club for another year so im not so sure what all the fuss is about
7449565 its something i cant control hes a very important player to this football club and im confident hell be at west coast next year
7449566 he judd was a victorian guy and he went home for family reasons kerr is a west australian bloke and he loves this football club and im confident hell be here next year
7449567 kerrys his own person and im sure hell make the right decision for himself
7449568 something drastic has to happen for him not to be here next year
7449569 hes a loyal person he could have gone back to victoria i think at 20 21 for the big bucks but he stayed loyal to the football club
7449570 except in three cases that of their wives their daughters and their girlfriends
7449571 nancy unwilling to stand up for womens pro choice beliefs
7449572 it is possible an agreement will be reached in the next two weeks
7449573 im a hillary delegate even so im a democrat first
7449574 i will do exactly what my candidate tells me to do
7449575 her election was really important to me i could feel it from my toes to my head but now i am supporting obama and im going to whatever i can do
7449576 there is no way the democrats are not going to come home
7449577 if we lose this election we ought to quit just quit
7449578 im going to vote and work for him but im not drinking the kool aid
7449579 my concern is that he has a compelling message of hope and change but that hasnt converted to numbers and votes
7449580 he is struggling in national polls i dont think im the only democrat who feels this way
7449581 he is a good person a good democrat i know he has the reputation for sticking his foot in his mouth but i like the fact that he is kind of a straight shooter
7449582 they have to get out of themselves and understand that the presidential election is about the course of history
7449583 i respect hillary clintons candidacy enormously i believe strongly in her
7449584 the presidency is not something that lends itself to on the job training
7449585 i would not accept it if anyone offered it to me the fact of the matter is id rather stay as chairman of the foreign relations committee than be vice president
7449586 you cannot go to a 7 eleven or a dunkin donuts unless you have a slight indian accent im not joking
7449587 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean
7449588 i mean thats a storybook man not a fairy tale
7449589 i mean you got the first mainstream african american who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy i mean thats a storybook man
7449590 and neither do we since noone wants to be on the ticket with me
7449591 articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy
7449592 the mainstream media has frankly put the security of our great country at risk with an obama coronation media like cnn amp msnbc is the only way obama managed to steal the dem nom its extremely concerning that so many americans could care less about who their candidate really is simply amazing and frankly scarey
7449593 i know ill pick the guy that doesnt endorse me thatll throw em off
7449594 leader who is ready to step in and be president
7449595 secondly do you want to live in a one party state because i have a few suggestions if so
7449596 if the liberal party was fair dinkum they would make sure that the president of the senate was an independent
7449597 if you want to make sure that question time is not a farce you would place someone in the chair that is an independent someone from a party that sits in the middle like family first
7449598 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7449599 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7449600 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7449601 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint
7449602 whether someone helps win you an election i think is kind of a side benefit you certainly want to pick someone who doesnt hurt you
7449603 with the possible exception of al gore i cant think of someone who generates as much excitement
7449604 mccain was the same for nearly seventy years then he changed
7449605 claiming that mccain suddenly transformed into a different bad man is not plausible
7449606 launching implausible negative attacks is not the new politics weve been promised
7449607 its not just something biden is making up back during the primaries i remember talking to a lot of people about how i thought the 2000 version of mccain might have made a pretty good president but the 2008 model not so much but then the 2000 version would never have won the republican nomination which is why he moved so far to the right
7449608 i think bidens gaffes tend to be pretty superficial they dont reflect a fundamental lack of knowledge or empathy far from it so much as a certain ham fistedness in putting words together this is almost entirely forgivable and unlikely to create long term problems
7449609 i voted for the bill before i voted against it
7449610 i had a look at it and it didnt look like much
7449611 i think it the scrutiny is just because its jeff farmer
7449612 he does something small and it gets magnified you get that sort of thing
7449613 you need players at a club to guide the younger guys
7449614 jeffs been around for a while and played in big games grand finals and some of the younger guys look up to him just the way he performs
7449615 the way hes been playing the last few weeks given the role around the midfield and creating for our team has been a positive and if he thinks he can play on next year then by all means
7449616 its been a great challenge working at fremantle and im very optimistic about the future of the fremantle football club
7449617 im intensely proud of my contribution to fremantle and the role that i have played in its growth
7449618 why dont we pass 1 3 trillion of that back to the people who pay the bills
7449619 that global warming is unequivocal and that human activity is the main driver very likely causing most of the rise in temperatures since 1950
7449620 with ties to the oil and gas coal and timber industries
7449621 ive made the selection and thats all youre going to get
7449622 getting away with murder how politics is destroying the criminal justice system
7449623 making the case for yourself a diet book for smart women
7449624 gore took what was a likely slam dunk and helped make it into a squeaker that went the other way
7449625 dont worry it wasnt your mistake it was the motorbike drivers mistake
7449626 normally there is one problem in cambodia when a car hit any person a license plate is removed if the driver wants to sell it if keeping the license plate no one will buy this car
7449627 ive spoken to kerry about his situation and hes publicly stated he wants to stay at the west coast eagles and hes contracted to the football club for another year so im not so sure what all the fuss is about
7449628 its something i cant control hes a very important player to this football club and im confident hell be at west coast next year
7449629 he judd was a victorian guy and he went home for family reasons kerr is a west australian bloke and he loves this football club and im confident hell be here next year
7449630 kerrys his own person and im sure hell make the right decision for himself
7449631 something drastic has to happen for him not to be here next year
7449632 hes a loyal person he could have gone back to victoria i think at 20 21 for the big bucks but he stayed loyal to the football club
7449633 it was disappointing we couldnt win for him hes been a terrific player for this football club for a long time and i thought his final effort that mark he sort of ran back with the flight of the football to take just summed up what the guys all about
7449634 well certainly miss him hes been such a big contributor to this football club for a long time
7449635 it is possible an agreement will be reached in the next two weeks
7449636 a nashville based free market think tank and watchdog organization
7449637 its easy i think of a man and i take away reason and accountability
7449638 his peccadillo defined as a slight offense in no way detracts from his ability to further his primary goal which is to eliminate poverty
7449639 the surprise for me is that he had only one affair
7449640 a tiny portion of america is casting half an eye towards us every now and then maybe we hope
7449641 all in favor of having the presumptive nominee be the actual nominee say more pork sausage please okay its unanimous sally could you bring everybody their own carafe of syrup and drop the check at microsoft at amp t and gms table over there in the corner thats a darling
7449642 even at the same location the temperature near the ground may be very different from the temperature 5 feet 1 52m above the ground and different again from 10 feet or 50 feet above the ground
7449643 particularly in the presence of vegetation say in a rainforest the temperature above the vegetation may be very different from the temperature below the top of the vegetation
7449644 a reasonable suggestion might be to use the average temperature of the first 50 feet of air either above ground or above the top of the vegetation to measure sat surface air temperature we have to agree on what it is and as far as i know no such standard has been suggested or generally adopted
7449645 the former u s vice president is just desperate for attention because he has no friends
7449646 i had a look at it and it didnt look like much
7449647 i think it the scrutiny is just because its jeff farmer
7449648 he does something small and it gets magnified you get that sort of thing
7449649 you need players at a club to guide the younger guys
7449650 jeffs been around for a while and played in big games grand finals and some of the younger guys look up to him just the way he performs
7449651 the way hes been playing the last few weeks given the role around the midfield and creating for our team has been a positive and if he thinks he can play on next year then by all means
7449652 its been a great challenge working at fremantle and im very optimistic about the future of the fremantle football club
7449653 im intensely proud of my contribution to fremantle and the role that i have played in its growth
7449654 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7449655 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7449656 free us from our addiction to oil free us from 4 00 gas save us from this climate crisis give us truly clean energy use the wind use the sun there is a solution there is no time to waste
7449657 we the american people are no longer asking were demanding
7449658 every single one of those quotations came from the campaign of 1960 when the republicans attacked john fitzgerald kennedy
7449659 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7449660 pakistans president pervez musharraf the dictator who reinvented himself as a u s ally against terrorism resigned to avoid facing impeachment charges for illegally seizing power and mishandling the economy
7449661 judge denies mans bid for new trial says deputies didnt intimidate jurors
7449662 if the liberal party was fair dinkum they would make sure that the president of the senate was an independent
7449663 if you want to make sure that question time is not a farce you would place someone in the chair that is an independent someone from a party that sits in the middle like family first
7449664 but at least the ministers know that they are going to be questioned on that subject they have had a chance to prepare
7449665 supplementary questions can be asked by anybody to drill deeper into the issues
7449666 the sort of comments we get about question time are never positive it would do governments well to look at that
7449667 the way to make question time work is for ministers to answer question and if the current labor governments ministers in the senate answered questions then we might not have such a big complaint
7449668 you spend half the morning getting briefed on every possible issue that might come up in your portfolio and then not get asked a single question
7449669 obamas shortlist has narrowed to a handful of names and president clintons former no 2 isnt one of them
7449670 one of the reasons for it was the debris that accumulated on the fence itself
7449671 while the bush administration may claim its taking environmental impacts of the border wall into consideration building wire mesh fences across washes prone to debris laden floods is fundamentally flawed
7449672 it doesnt take an expert hydrologist to anticipate the potential for these walls to become like dams
7449673 especially in flash flood type of storms where a lot of water and debris are generated very quickly and can pile up against the fences very rapidly
7449674 we are still required to follow every environmental rule regulation and policy
7449675 he does not waive us doing what we would have to do without the waiver so it doesnt change anything in the environment
7449676 the monument had suggested that they take into consideration everything that can happen with a weather event
7449677 we had a concern that this was going to happen
7449678 clinical trials in russia 2008 russia compared to other countries
7449679 not pretend we can achieve his goal without cost or without sacrifice
7449680 new energy economy will create new businesses new industries and millions of new jobs jobs that pay well jobs that cant be outsourced good union jobs
7449681 we will get one million 150 mile per gallon plug in electric hybrids on our roads within six years
7449682 american people to meet the goal of reducing our demand for electricity 15 percent by the end of the next decade
7449683 the largest profit in the history of the united states this is the company that last quarter made 1 500 every second thats more than 300 000 in the time it takes you to fill up a tank with gas thats costing you more than 4 a gallon
7449684 barack obama has chosen paris hilton as his vice presidential running mate
7449685 welcome to obama mobile you will now be one of the 1st notified when the vp candidate is selected
7449686 barack will announce his vp candidate choice through txt msg between now amp the conv tell everyone
7449687 dear supporter today our campaign joins in a historic partnership with al gore together we will move america forward yes we can
7449688 there is incredible enthusiasm for senator obamas vice presidential announcement and unfortunately some people have used that enthusiasm and sent out hoaxes
7449689 we can assure supporters these texts are not coming from the campaign and their data is secure
7449690 even though the president is the president this is going to be john mccains convention and you want it to be about john mccain and what his presidency would be
7449691 the two of them would embrace and make brief remarks and bush would escort reagan off to air force one and salute the president as he departed new orleans and the convention and then george bush would get in his motorcade after saluting ronald reagan and go downtown to be the nominee of the republican party
7449692 balance benefiting from voters desires to continue the clinton approach while allowing gore to take the torch and emerge from the large clinton shadow
7449693 i dont think there are a lot of people who want to see him at the convention
7449694 should stay home from the republican convention and everybody would be better off
7449695 the presidents approval rating among republicans base voters who are needed for a successful mccain campaign is relatively high
7449696 the assumption would be that there will be some kind of physical handoff
7449697 i think there is a sense that they would appear together he is the sitting president hes still popular among hard core republicans mccain has some issues with hard core republicans some people will say this was a bad way to play it but i think its one of those things where you have to run through it and do it and embrace it
7449698 theres a short list for show and then theres the actual short list
7449699 the ultimate fascination with veepstakes is as much about who is on the list as much as who might actually be chosen
7449700 that was a classic example of people benefiting from being on the list
7449701 before if you followed the nfl it was enough just to know the player
7449702 now more fans tend to know who the strength coach is for the baltimore ravens
7449703 al gore and dick cheney have redefined the vice presidency probably forever
7449704 that elevated the notion of do no harm to the golden rule of vice presidential selection
7449705 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
7449706 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
7449707 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
7449708 the decisions to develop ice minus bacteria herbicide resistant plants and bovine growth hormone lent credibility to those who argued that biotechnology would make things worse before it made things better
7449709 my biggest fear about biotechnology is not that by accident we will set loose some genetically defective andromeda strain given our past record in dealing with agriculture were far more likely to accidentally drown ourselves in a sea of excess grain
7449710 it was cheap oil nobody worried about it because it was cheap
7449711 i tried to warn them but the elders of this planet would not listen
7449712 they called me foolish and laughed at my predictions yet even now the midwest is flooded the ice caps are melting and the cities are rocked with tremors just as i foretold fools why didnt they heed me before it was too late
7449713 dream in color how the sanchez sisters are making history in congress
7449714 without a doubt there are certain members of congress who still believe women dont belong there and there are those who see women just as sexual objects
7449715 try to use their femininity or their good looks to finagle things out of people and the other members really resent that
7449716 male superiority is very deeply ingrained in some latino men of a certain generation
7449717 and baca belongs to that camp although he would certainly deny that
7449718 any claims of male superiority within the congressional hispanic caucus are simply not true
7449719 we place value on the commitment and hard work necessary to advance the goals of the latino community not ones gender
7449720 i dont remember a time in our country when so many things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously
7449721 our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse gasoline prices are increasing dramatically and so are electricity rates
7449722 the climate crisis in particular is getting a lot worse much more quickly than predicted
7449723 were borrowing money from china to buy oil from the persian gulf to burn it in ways that destroy the planet every bit of thats got to change
7449724 choosing change or choosing to do the same things that got us into this mess in the first place
7449725 the biggest celebrity in the world but is he ready to lead
7449726 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7449727 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7449728 if you listen to barack obama and the people around him they certainly seem to be signaling that the choice will be someone who has instantly recognizable national security experience
7449729 that means joe biden maybe evan bayh not tim kaine of virginia and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7449730 just about every indication that i have charlie from people close to the process is that theyre going to try to hold this until saturday
7449731 to get the word out just a little bit before barack obama and the pick show up in springfield illinois
7449732 they the heartland americans are bitter clinging to guns and religion and have atipithy toward those who dont look like them
7449733 they will try to make you afraid of me because i dont look like the other presidents
7449734 one night after being mistreated as a pow a guard loosened the ropes binding me easing my pain on christmas that same guard approached me without saying a word he drew a cross in the sand we stood wordlessly looking at the cross remembering the true light of christmas
7449735 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners
7449736 not long ago in baghdad al qaeda took two young women who were mentally disabled and put suicide vests on them sent them into a marketplace and by remote control detonated those suicide vests
7449737 if that isnt evil you have to tell me what is
7449738 i have a long record of that support of alternate energy ive always been for all of those and i have not missed any crucial vote but my citizens in arizona know that when im running for the president of the united states i have to be out campaigning
7449739 if you were president and you knew that bin laden was in pakistan and you knew where would you have u s forces go in after him
7449740 larry im not gonna go there and heres why pakistan is a sovereign nation i think the pakistanis want bin laden out of their hair and out of their country as causing great difficulties in pakistan itself but i want to assure you that i will get osama bin laden as president of the united states and i will bring him to justice no matter what it takes
7449741 hey lou i just got this package from al gore he asked us to hide it
7449742 this idiots voting for mccain but he knows nothing about him
7449743 this guy has his facts wrong and hes voting for obama
7449744 and maybe even the big surprise you know someone like hillary clinton or al gore
7449745 if anyone says something about my surname i say we are not related i am ashamed
7449746 however nothing rallies the righties like a clinton a recent poll showed 49 of americans would never vote for hillary
7449747 youve gotta stand for something or youre gonna fall for anything
7449748 smack some sense into our so called president with my bare hands
7449749 senator tom coburn announces that he will introduce a bill of impeachment

7449754 november 19 2010 president obama holds private talks with house speaker savage two days later the republicans introduce a flurry of bills
7449755 most folks have assumed that gore is off the vp list but he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment
7449756 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
7449757 if your are going to go with gore why not go with hillary who really earned her place there by campaigning for the presidency and winning 18 million supporters i guess it is too much to ask for a woman to be seriously considered even when she is qualified
7449758 i invented the whole thing and ive never seen a dime from it
7449759 if a musician records a song does he not get royalties for every purchase if an author writes a book does he not see royalties too if a barely eighteen year old girl stars in a porno does she not receive money im just asking for what i rightfully deserve
7449760 its not as if someone can just cut gore a huge check
7449761 hes going to have to track down each individual that ever bought sold or profited off the internet in the last three decades the amount of time and money to do this could potentially be even more than the money gore could possibly collect
7449762 i cant honestly expect to collect from every little guy grandmas selling quilts online and the like but i certainly will be targeting the big guys like google microsoft and smooth operator
7449763 the bottom line is presidential campaigns are marathons that require physical fortitude beyond anything you ever see in politics
7449764 setting aside time with your family time to exercise and time just to clear your head and think is an imperative not a luxury and its also the hardest thing the candidate has to find time to do
7449765 many people would and he seems to be one of them find that they get some kind of solace or opportunity for decompression and relaxation
7449766 it was hard to connect to al gore to relate to gore in 2000
7449767 the question of bush and who youd rather have a drink with may have said more about gore than george bush
7449768 for sen obama and michelle their family comes first that has meant making time for the kind of family activities they enjoyed before the campaign
7449769 many americans have a hard time thinking about our energy future largely because their energy present is so challenging
7449770 staying on our present track is an invitation to sustained higher prices
7449771 if policies reward reducing global warming pollution private capital will flow towards clean energy solutions
7449772 efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man made climate change and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change
7449773 the mere fact that diane nash was born and raised on the southside of chicago but ended up in nashville tn at fisk as one of the movements most dynamic young leaders is astounding while just a few miles away in carthage tn was al gores home and later gore moved to nashville to work as a journalist while ms nash was on the front lines of the civil rights movement in this country mr gore was in vietnam although they started in tennessee with separate missions what they did through out their lives changed the nation and impacted the world i look forward to hearing their testimonies
7449774 we feel that if we pay these fines we would be contributing to and supporting the injustice and immoral practices that have been performed in the arrest and conviction of the defendants
7449775 do you feel it is wrong to discriminate against a person solely on the basis of their race or color
7449776 computer world posted a expressed disappointment that the doubling rate for price performance of pv is 10 years rather than 18 months for transistors which of these two has the facts on their side

7449782 if hed been president we wouldnt have had these bush administration messes the past eight years
7449783 also we admire his tenacity in protecting the environment many share his vision on what needs to be done
7449784 we saw cost reductions for silicon computer chips of 50 for every year and a half for the last 40 years
7449785 were now beginning to see the same kind of sharp cost reductions as the demand grows for solar cells they build new more efficient facilities to build these solar cells
7449786 thats why i want him on the ballot hell drain 1 percent of obamas vote it will be a close election and that will make a difference
7449787 a lot of foolish people will vote for ralph nader this was a strategic signature
7449788 the only way the major candidates are going to address these issues is if they are at risk of losing votes
7449789 never vote for a junior senator running for president regardless of who he she might be

7449865 the fact that the saddleback civil forum on the presidency took place at all is a sign that both parties intend to fight for the votes of religious christians
7449866 little noticed is language in this years draft democratic platform that strongly supports a womans decision to have a child by ensuring access to health care income support and adoption programs
7449867 era of reducing christianity to a narrow set of ideological commitments is over
7449868 the unsustainable exertions necessary to attempt to square his reasonable sounding rhetoric on abortion with the extremism of his record
7449869 is willing to permit any abortions in any circumstances hed better possess an absolute moral nullity of the fetus

7449876 reflected not so much a civil forum as a push for a theocratic presidency one that would be deeply influenced by warrens evangelism

7449878 it is fascinating to observe how individual proteins can determine addictive behavioral patterns
7449879 in addition our results open up whole new prospects for treating addiction thus blocking the nr1 receptor might protect from relapsing into addiction selective activation of glur1 would even contribute to extinguishing the addiction
7449880 the research raises the perception both of how common these events are and specifically where they may occur
7449881 today with so many more buildings and people a magnitude 5 centered below the city would be extremely attention getting
7449882 wed see billions in damage with some brick buildings falling people would probably be killed
7449883 we need to step backward from the simple old model where you worry about one large obvious fault like they do in california
7449884 the problem here comes from many subtle faults we now see there is earthquake activity on them each one is small but when you add them up they are probably more dangerous than we thought we need to take a very close look
7449885 the probability is not zero and the damage could be great
7449886 it could be like something out of a greek myth
7449887 indian point is situated at the intersection of the two most striking linear features marking the seismicity and also in the midst of a large population that is at risk in case of an accident
7449888 this is clearly one of the least favorable sites in our study area from an earthquake hazard and risk perspective
7449889 new data developed in the last 20 years disclose a substantially higher likelihood of significant earthquake activity in the vicinity of indian point that could exceed the earthquake design for the facility
7449890 nothing happens for a while then it goes with a bang
7449891 is a major substantiation of a feature that bears on the long term earthquake risk of the northeastern united states
7449892 it gives us the best possible evidence that we have an earthquake hazard here that should be a factor in any planning decision it crystallizes the argument that this hazard is not random there is a structure to the location and timing of the earthquakes this enables us to contemplate risk in an entirely different way and since we are able to do that we should be required to do that
7449893 new york is not as prone to earthquakes as california and japan but they do happen this study takes a more realistic look at the possibility of larger ones and why earthquakes concentrate in certain places to understand risk you have to multiply hazard by assets and vulnerability when you factor that in our risk is high too much attention has been paid to the level of hazard and not enough to the risk earthquake hazard is about the same today as in 1609 when henry hudson sailed up the river but earthquake risk is much much higher today since the number of people assets and their vulnerability are so much greater
7449894 we think that the intersection of these two features being so close to indian point makes it a place of greater risk than most other points on the map
7449895 most people underestimate the hazard here any conservative approach will look at geologically similar environments if you do that we are similar to bhuj india where a 2001 magnitude 7 quake killed over 15 000 people there was no obvious sign of strain there there is a mystery here to be solved and we better step back and do our homework
7449896 once you accept that one fault in a family is active you better consider that all the faults in that family could be active we need to adapt our structures with that in mind
7449897 you could debate whether a magnitude 6 or 7 is possible but weve already had three magnitude fives so that is very realistic there is no one now alive now to remember that last one so people tend to forget and having only a partial 300 year history we may not have seen everything we could see there could be surprises things bigger than we have ever seen
7449898 elderly voters especially elderly voters who live in long term care settings are at the mercy of others when it comes to exercising their right to vote
7449899 childrens rejection of unpalatable medications and bitter tasting foods is a complex product of maturing sensory systems genetic variation experiences and culture
7449900 a better understanding of the sensory world of the child and the scientific basis for distaste and how to ameliorate it is a public health priority
7449901 the number one reason for non compliance among children when taking medicine or eating vegetables is that they dont like the taste
7449902 just look at a childs face when theyre eating some of these things
7449903 bitter taste is a sensation that evolved to make you not want to ingest something
7449904 it is interesting because it may suggest that children have heightened bitter sensitivity compared to adults
7449905 we find that the more a mother eats fruits when shes pregnant the more a child will accept fruits and vegetables
7449906 in england there is a lot of lemon flavor added to childrens medicine its a cultural phenomenon bubblegum and cherry are popular in the united states
7449907 it is one of the fundamental mysteries of human behavior why do we grow to like these foods and flavors that we initially rejected
7449908 the importance and challenge of paying for quality nursing care
7449909 historically the economic value that nursing brings to the patient care process has not been recognized or quantified
7449910 improving the quality of nursing care through work environment changes or increases in staffing is viewed by many as an added cost but the benefits in terms of money saved through improved nursing satisfaction and patient outcomes are not considered

7449957 the reason we expanded this recall is to act in the best interests of public health and our consumers
7449958 we have no evidence of any further contamination beyond the original two lines under investigation by the regulators but we felt given the new information of yesterday that we had to take the most conservative approach possible and the most conservative approach we could think of was to recall 100 of the production from the entire facility
7449959 we are sanitizing the entire facility in the interest of public safety to ensure that the product we produce in that facility is safe
7449960 one of the greatest vice presidents in the history of the united states

7449962 hes got the passion to lift up middle class americans he hasnt forgotten his working class roots hes got the expertise that will make him a great counselor on international crises that may come up
7449963 joe and i have been friends for many many years and we know each other very well and so i think hes made a very wise selection
