2340000 we are looking at our schedules and this includes port rotation
2340001 we havent come to any conclusions yet but we are well aware there is a lot of speculation
2340002 we can only come out and say something when the revised schedule is nailed down
2340003 if there is a move being contemplated it is based on getting an efficient service and a quick turnaround for the customer minimising transport costs is also a factor
2340004 tokbox has an impressive and very loyal and energetic user base
2340005 the company is executing well and its service offers consumers a variety of great features that strongly differentiate tokbox from competitors we are excited to be investing with our partners at seqouia in a company we believe has the potential to be the next big thing in web communication

2340009 that would be wonderful can you drive me to starbucks this was where i was supposed to have met my client i crawled into the backseat stilettos and all and enjoyed a ride right to the front door of starbucks
2340010 i think we might have to cut out a tiny piece of the bottom shelf in that cupboard to being able to fit the new meter and to do that we need a written confirmation from the landlord
2340011 does that mean that you wont do anything today not until you have received that written confirmation
2340012 oh yeah thats the insert latin for funky houseplant mushroom
2340013 at the same time because they dont have 61 sports that they have commitments to and are constantly juggling and balancing their limited time windows they will be enthusiastic about preview shows and qualifying shows and longer pre races for our fans especially that will be most noticeable difference its just a lot more coverage
2340014 we have found the k12 curriculum to be far above anything we could have done on our own plus we have the added advantage of an actual teacher for help
2340015 student student interaction is also actively encouraged so this virtual schools students are always well educated and well socialized
2340016 one to one student teacher interaction give your child an education comparable to the best private schools

2340092 the residents of usk and surrounding areas in south kildare are extremely disappointed today to find that an bord plean la has again chosen to ignore its own inspector the guidelines of the national waste management plan the wishes of the elected representatives of county kildare and all the people of south kildare in facilitating greenstar holdings
2340093 following eight long years of campaigning in excess of 300 000 of local peoples own money a resounding high court victory and three oral hearings we are at a loss to understand how the board could entertain the thought of granting this application we are at a loss on all levels to understand why an bord plean la feels compelled to facilitate greenstar holdings in this application which is totally inappropriate for this location and is not designed or intended to take any waste from kildare but to take waste from all parts of ireland to dump in kildare quote from ms margaret heavey of greenstar in the third oral hearing november 2007
2340094 we have said all along that kildare is now designated to be the thoroughbred dumping county of ireland and bord plean la has facilitated it
2340095 the committee of usk and district residents association ltd will meet with our legal and technical experts to review the planning file and decide on our next course of action
2340096 kildare county council refused this application in 2004 and at two oral hearings the inspector of the day has recommended refusal but the planning board has overturned the decisions of both the county council and its own inspectors
2340097 there was a crowd of about 15 young people some of them very young gathered in the moorefield park area early on saturday evening
2340098 several of the others ran away but he did not hes not afraid of anyone
2340099 i warned him that he was not to go back to moorefield park and he didnt but he was on the loose afterwards because i saw him again in the town later that night
2340100 i was over visiting friends when a group of youths gathered behind a row of houses in a green area they began drinking cans of beer and started to become loud and disruptive
2340101 there were four male and four females at this stage they were requested to move on but became rude and abusive there was one male who was more abusive than the others and they began to abuse the guests at the barbecue
2340102 it seems this troublesome teenager has a big following in the area and a larger group began to gather about four or five more males and at least half a dozen other females

2340112 there was a certain creditor which had two debts the one owed five hundred pence and the other owed fifty and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me then which one of those two debtors will love him the most
2340113 i suppose that it would be the one whom he forgave more that will love him the most
2340114 her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven that one loves little
2340115 thank you god for not making me like other men extortionists unjust adulterers or like that tax collector

2340120 he had no wrinkles can you imagine he was 95 and had no wrinkles i think he had a subcutaneous layer of olive oil
2340121 he had a slow dementia which made it very hard on me because i didnt know where he was he didnt communicate much any more

2340130 air supremacy over japan could have exerted sufficient pressure to bring about unconditional surrender and obviate the need for invasion based on a detailed investigation of all the facts and supported by the testimony of the surviving japanese leaders involved it is the surveys opinion that japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped even if russia had not entered the war and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2340131 no effort was made and none was seriously considered to achieve surrender merely in order not to have to use the bomb
2340132 to browbeat the russians with the bomb held rather ostentatiously on our hip
2340133 there was never any illusion on my part that russia was our enemy and that the project was conducted on that basis
2340134 a self righteous one way legal moral screen with positive images of western values and innocence portrayed as threatened validating a campaign of unrestricted violence

2340143 in fact no group of parents married single step or even empty nest reported significantly greater emotional well being than people who never had children its such a counterintuitive finding because we have these cultural beliefs that children are the key to happiness and a healthy life and theyre not

2340158 it could take two men to do what was done
2340159 but one of us has to come home early and you know that is going to really hurt

2340166 every time i pick up a new game im like oh my god theyve changed the controller mappings again and now ive got to you know reconfigure my head just so i can start to enjoy this game
2340167 with something like the wii you just pick it up and its natural
2340168 i dont think theres anything preventing the game complexity of
2340169 i happen to believe that we will come out stronger if people feel that their voices were heard and their views respected i think that is a very big part of how we actually come out unified
2340170 because i know from just what im hearing that theres incredible pent up desire and i think that people want to feel like ok its a catharsis were here we did it and then everybody get behind senator obama that is what most people believe is the best way to go

2340173 ik hou het publiek een spiegel voor bepaalde redeneringen die mensen maken licht ik uit vergroot ik en maak ik zodanig belachelijk dat mensen er stil bij gaan staan ik kan daar niet zomaar op antwoorden hoe mensen zullen reageren misschien kan het inderdaad dat ze te veel zullen relativeren dan is het zo waarom zou dat niet goed zijn tot nu toe is de enige communicatie over extreemrechts het feit dat het slecht is terwijl als we even stil staan het duidelijk is dat onze maatschappij goed rechts aan het worden is de rechtse zaak is geen marginaal feit meer
2340174 the outcome would potentially see farmers holding 65 per cent of the combined entity and pgg wrightson with a shareholding of approximately 35 per cent
2340175 we have now addressed both these points with debt reduction of 150 million and our announced plant restructurings these have been achieved prior to the proposed 220 million capital injection into our company
2340176 the dynamics would have changed as far as silver fern farms is concerned if you put pgw and silver fern farms together in partnership that provides a different platform to involve the alliance company
2340177 plan b is a continuation of what weve got and we dont believe thats appropriate thats what this whole plan is all about its about changing what weve got
2340178 the question for the future is what the nhs will cover on the basis of its founding principle of free at the point of need

2340181 we have seen an increase of at least 30 to 33 in people coming in with queries about what they are entitled to now they are unemployed
2340182 some people ask about training and a lot of people are coming to get a computer course
2340183 because of the industries these people are coming out of
2340184 a high number of people have been let go from the construction industry for example and are now having to retrain to find jobs in other areas
2340185 a lot of them would never have needed a cv before
2340186 we would have a blank cv and fill it out for them
2340187 we would have had a few people who had to freeze their mortgage for a while
2340188 we have had people coming in the door and they dont know where to go and a lot of people didnt know we existed
2340189 i hope not i hope it will get better but it is not looking good

2340201 for the foreseeable future winning the long war against violent extremist movements will be the central objective of the u s
2340202 cannot lose sight of the implications of fighting a long term episodic multi front and multidimensional conflict more complex and diverse than the cold war confrontation with communism
2340203 success in iraq and afghanistan is crucial to winning this conflict but it alone will not bring victory
2340204 the use of force plays a role but may be less important than measures to promote local participation in government and economic programs to spur development as well as efforts to understand and address the grievances that often lie at the heart of insurgencies
2340205 despite our apparent growth as a nation the problems for many are still increasing

2340207 it is becoming a death trap and i am asking the county council to reduce the speed limit and to have traffic calming measures put in place
2340208 athy has had a huge traffic problem for the last five to ten years both speeding and the volume of traffic on this road are making it dangerous for local residents and pedestrians to walk in the area
2340209 it is of concern that there have recently been accidents on this stretch of road and usually people who are not used to the area are the ones involved
2340210 there have been accidents where people who were not used to the road came around the corner and ended up in the ditch
2340211 i am now calling on the county council to ensure the section of road within its boundary is made safe by implementing speed bumps
2340212 as we continue to promote a passion in science and technology in schools and students throughout the island we also need to ensure that schools have the means to travel to the exhibition our grant scheme goes some way to offset travel and accommodation costs and give schools an added incentive to enter
2340213 theres a certain degree to which my vineyards are built from other peoples castoffs
2340214 abe just jumped in without having been plagued by that conservatism and hes friends with enough of us to keep from sliding off that cliff

2340222 he has a style thats more advanced than most people who have been making wine for the period of time that he has
2340223 thats exactly something i said to myself a few years ago
2340224 it would be an exaggeration to say im out there saving vineyards
2340225 its not an obstacle but its not a reason to go into the vineyard either
2340226 its just the opposite of what you think of as terroir

2340240 we believe it will be a website which individuals will like to view on a regular basis to see the developments that are taking place the projects we are presently undertaking the fundraising events we are arranging and read our news section with interest
2340241 when we began the july programme we didnt know what to expect
2340242 once we met the children and settled in got to know their habits and personalities it was very easy to realise how lucky we were to be able to have this experience
2340243 the children had many experiences which they would not normally expect during the school year a trip to athy fire station where we learned all about the fire services and where the children got hands on with the fire engine fishing on the canal cooking scones and biscuit cakes to bring home to their families dance and gymnastics which they performed for their family on family day drumming and using unusual musical instruments
2340244 the children also made a lasting mark on the school by creating a beautiful mural with guidance of artistic directors clodagh doyle and evelyn quinlan
2340245 as the programme is finishing up we can reflect on all the experiences we had and all the things we learned by working with the children alhough the work may be challenging with every challenge comes great benefits and we have benefited as much from this programme as the children have
2340246 last years show drew the largest attendance ever and the event has grown from strength to strength over the years
2340247 most of those nominated are the type of people who work away in communities without recognition and they are always shocked when they are nominated
2340248 its great to see the continued popularity of these awards based on community work to see people being recognised by their own community and better still to have that recognition spread across the county
2340249 people often acknowledge the good deeds of others when they have passed on but it is really great to see those working within the community getting acclaim when they are here to enjoy it
2340250 winning the overall award last year gave our campaign for an education centre for autistic children in kildare a great boost
2340251 its been a door opener for the association and the aims we are trying to achieve the support of the public has been phenomenal in terms of fundraising initiatives and corporate sponsor ship but of course we still have so much more to attain
2340252 he can focus on movies video games or legos for hours but cant focus on his schoolwork for more than five minutes
2340253 scholars claim that no other passage shows the errors of scripture more than luke 2 1 4
2340254 we have no record of the census mentioned in the passage but we do of many others around this time we know that quirinius was not governor for another six years and whats more the romans did not require people to register in their home towns

2340262 top priority is closing the borders and protecting the culture
2340263 i did not support our invasion of iraq to begin with and i wish it had not happened however i have the sense to know that an immediate and complete withdrawal of forces would be disastrous i would implement a timely and efficient plan to bring our brave men and women home from iraq as soon as possible and remove them from harms way
2340264 there are people who are having trouble making ends meet there are people losing their homes there are people so far in debt they may think that they will never get back on their feet these are the people who we should reach out to assistance should only be given to those who earn it those who make a living checking their mail boxes for a monthly check will need to look elsewhere because america can no longer carry them

2340269 barack obama doesnt support legislation to prohibit anyone but sailors motorcycle gangs and others of low moral fiber from getting tattoos
2340270 barack obama doesnt even remember back when you could go to the movies for a nickel and that included popcorn and a coke
2340271 barack obama listens to that rap stuff its not even really music what happened to real music anyway
2340272 barack obama wants to let the damn kids today play video games on a perfectly beautiful afternoon instead of going out and getting some fresh air and sunshine

2340305 by 2015 a globally networked intelligence enterprise will be essential to meet the demands for greater forethought and improved strategic agility the existing agency centric intelligence community must evolve into a true intelligence enterprise established on a collaborative foundation of shared services mission centric operations and integrated mission management all enabled by a smooth flow of people ideas and activities across the boundaries of the intelligence community agency members
2340306 old problems assume new dimensions information operations with emphasis on a cyber domain asymmetric political or military responses and illicit trafficking lastly we confront the challenge of acting in an environment that is more time sensitive and open to the flow of information in which intelligence sources and analysis compete in a public context established by a global media by 2015 we will need integrated and collaborative capabilities that can anticipate and rapidly respond to a wide array of threats and risks
2340307 our analytic professionals will collaborate with world class experts in academe commercial interests and think tanks all with similar knowledge and personal networks deep expertise will require broad access to open source information our unique collection results and a network of outside experts our understanding of the breadth and depth of policy intelligence doctrine and global situational awareness must match the depth of our analyses
2340308 by 2015 the intelligence community will be expected to provide more details about more issues to more customers we anticipate different types of customers with greater expectations
2340309 to carry out its mission in an increasingly turbulent and complex global environment the intelligence enterprise must

2340343 i suppose after the wicklow game you wouldnt have expected to be in the all ireland quarter finals but in fairness to the lads we kept focussed
2340344 the qualifiers havent been good to us since they have started but this year we took one game at a time and here we are in the quarter finals
2340345 that performance is nothing to get excited about but we ground out a win and thats what we set out to do we have a lot of work to do though but it gives us another game
2340346 after the wicklow game we drew a line in the sand and said enough is enough regardless of the opposition the last couple of years our performances have been poor and thats the biggest disappointment
2340347 we are still there which is a great thing but we have nothing won and 90 per cent of people out there looking at us would say we are going to win nothing and thats okay it suits us
2340348 hes not the one just wait dont listen to what he says
2340349 and were going to fuck you as if you ruined it

2340363 i look in the mirror i see my hair is black
2340364 thats uh interesting i guess you understand that you have green hair about as well as you understand that youre a terrible reporter
2340365 why didnt you get so defensive when i said you had green hair
2340366 is batting 600 12 for 20 with three homers and six rbis in five games since joining the dodgers
2340367 i dont worry about it too much if something happens it happens
2340368 i still am in shock that i did that i just cant believe i did that im such an idiot
2340369 i have no doubt that there will be some people very happy to draw kildare in the last eight but were very happy just to be there
2340370 ok there were some woeful wides in the first half but dont forget that we also managed to hit the post and the crossbar as well as miss a penalty in the second half we stayed calm won some good possession and were able to take the right decisions under pressure that made the difference
2340371 i would have to agree that it was a very poor game and we would need to step it up considerably next time out
2340372 it really doesnt make any difference to us who weve drawn in the quarter final we have an awful lot of work to do still and more than enough on our place to leave is concentrating on ironing out the kinks out of our own game
2340373 we are the only team that are being asked to go out four weekends on the trot
2340374 tyrone could have been in that position but they have gotten the extra week because theyre playing dublin
2340375 we have a number of injury worries now including johnny doyle its just pure fatigue and a build up of wear and tear after so many close tight games and the knocks that go with that we are being seriously disadvantaged and it seems a very strange decision when there has been so much talk about burnout many of our players are worn out
2340376 we put in a request for a deferral of one week but were told on sunday night that this would not be possible i dont know why thats the case there is time even if a replay was needed sure dublin and tyrone arent on until the 16th so clearly our quarter final could be as well
2340377 it doesnt seem right that we had to wait nine weeks from the wicklow game to the first qualifier and then we are suddenly in the middle of such an intense programme of four games in 22 days alright you might say thats what you get for losing your first game but it doesnt seem fair to me
2340378 i was found in oklahoma in 2001 my neck was slit nose broken with what looked like burns from cigarettes on my face i was tied to a log amp left in a pile of wood to be burned

2340604 myself and my cousin siobhan tallon played in australia and loved it we had no football team in our area so i joined grange at the time we joined they were and still are a brilliant club we contested two junior all irelands and won a couple of leinsters and a few county finals they were really at the height of everything then they were brilliant
2340605 a local priest father jim tormey made me go to a match one day when he told me he was short of players and put me on a bus back in 1984
2340606 i was about seven and i met the treacys the lawlors and the oconnors a few local players where also playing and we all went along i loved it from the first day
2340607 i actually played wing back for a good while actually for a lot of the years with the club the club scene would have been very strong winning a leinster in 96 the challenge would have been just unreal where we were from and it was the only sport being played camogie has been a little diluted over the last few years in places because of the increase in gaelic football just because a lot of girls choose one or the other whereas in those places growing up there was no choice everybody played camogie and there were some brilliant players so i only went to midfield when i came back from australia
2340608 i was a late starter and when i came back from australia i really got into it i went into the county squad and never missed training or matches getting totally into it i also played college out in ucd i just got very much into the whole thing and i was probably later than most starting
2340609 we went to london to play the first round of the championship and we beat london well it was a really good trip because we werent real ly sure where things were going with the county scene and it was just a very good bonding weekend for everyone it was very good for us all to be away together outside of the club scene then we played roscommon two weeks ago and we drew with them next up was meath which we lost that was our three qualifying matches so well see how it goes when we face roscommon in the knock out stages this weekend
2340610 i worked for the bank of ireland and went on tour with them in 2002 for the games as they were the premier sponsors at the time and they were offering sponsorships for 20 people in ireland so i said great it would get me out of work for a while and away from the desk i came here in 2002 and never looked back ive done contract work then left for the summer and then came back and i was made permanent about two years ago
2340611 brilliant yeah it is really good we had a really good campaign last year with the supporting athlete campaign and we have another one coming up next year in january it is a great place to come up with your own ideas and if you think of an idea and they think its good theyll let you run with it were not really under any very strict guide lines and they let you use you own innovative which is brilliant i love that they dont stifle anything dont get me wrong working in the bank at the time was great craic but here its just completely different plus you get first hand to change peoples lives everyday
2340612 it is unbelievable one of the girls that works here is from wexford and she just told me earlier today that a cousin of hers where the brothers would all have all irelands with wexford county medals and club medals and every kind of medals then their brother took up golf last year and he won his first medal up to that hed never spoken about his brothers winning medals but last year he was at mass one day and wondered would the priest read out from the altar all the medals theyd all won because now they have a golf medal in the family it is things like that that are brilliant he was practically saying to the lads that his was worth more because his was an all ireland medal and they only had club and county all ireland medals
2340613 it starts with sport but then we have the athlete leadership programme alps where athletes can do public speaking where they have their own radio station they go to events and gigs and represent special olympics ireland they also speak on behalf of the organisation which also improves their confidence and self esteem things like that they wouldnt have been given such an opportunity before here it does definitely change their lives for the better
2340614 it is brilliant you see people like mary davis who was my ceo and has the most energy of a woman ive ever met she is brilliant and has just been made managing director of special olympics europe eurasia which is absolutely massive it is a great honour for everyone who has worked with her here
2340615 there are people who have been here 30 years 25 or 20 years it is unbelievable that there are 18 000 volunteers 12 000 athletes and 420 clubs and centres around the country so when you think back about when it started there were only 200 athletes and it has gone to 12 000 that is absolutely massive then hosting the olympic games here was probably the highlight of that for everyone on top of that last year going to china with 200 athletes and coaches was unbelievable so to think how far weve come in a relative short space of time is just amazing
2340616 the games are on from the 6 to the 14 of february next year there is a team of eight athletes that are going out it is a small team because it is the winter olympics the team has been chosen recently and they have their first training session in august and there is going to be a group of 40 volunteers traveling with them they are preparing away up in kilternan training and then they have group sessions some of the athletes are also from belfast so they are also training up there
2340617 thats when we launch the support an athlete campaign where by we are going to raise five million euros over the next two years so thats going to be the launching pad for that trying to get people involved for fundraising all around the country
2340618 that bloke from oasis said i couldnt play guitar somebody should have told him im a fuckin rock star

2340621 people want to see more renewable energy development and by participating on facebook the users can actually see that development occur it is a unique opportunity to witness and participate in companies going green
2340622 its like a petition with a guaranteed outcome from participation if facebook users get behind this effort they know they can make a change
2340623 for us its an incentive to incorporate green energy in our sustainability strategies
2340624 we jumped at the opportunity to participate in the application
2340625 green my vino gives the community the opportunity to interact with businesses and make their voices heard when people participate in the application theyre telling us that clean energy is a priority for them and well make supporting renewable energy a part of our commitment as a business

2340644 our study suggests that compounds such as sulforaphane from broccoli may help counter processes linked to the development of vascular disease in diabetes
2340645 in future it will be important to test if eating a diet rich in brassica vegetables has health benefits for diabetic patients we expect that it will
2340646 it is encouraging to see that professor thornalley and his team have identified a potentially important substance that may protect and repair blood vessels from the damaging effects of diabetes
2340647 it also may help add some scientific weight to the argument that eating broccoli is good for you
2340648 do you envision yourself doing bad things to these characters
2340649 well sometimes bad things happen like car accidents or someone tripping and breaking their leg
2340650 no i mean do you actually perpetrate bad things to these characters
2340651 the only difference between you and a writer is that a writer writes these stories down
2340652 if you dont start sending those books out to a publisher im revoking your computer privileges the amount of time you spend there on this hobby of yours is ridiculous there needs to be a purpose to all of this
2340653 so this first year i think we will be ok it is if this drought continues to linger on for a year or two
2340654 one of the issues we will have to deal with this field wont be as big of an issue but some of those other fields the empty heads out there we are going to have to figure out a way to shred them and knock out them small heads to get them to germinate before we put the crop in next year
2340655 and in some cases the wheat fields didnt even get a chance to head out
2340656 the wheat and the barley people are turning claims in right now there is nothing there alot of them figure they are not even going to combine it the hay fields alot of them are getting zeroed they are zeroing out the hay fields there is just nothing there
2340657 in our case we are more diversified we got the farming operation we did get some hail storms on our winter wheat up north but fortunately it created an opportunity to go make some feed
2340658 the chesapeake bay conservation funding authorized by congress was the single most important federal initiative in the last 30 years to reduce pollution and restore a healthy and productive chesapeake bay
2340659 from day one the bush administration has not made clean water a priority this proposal to eliminate conservation funding continues that legacy
2340660 by cutting funding for the 2008 farm bills chesapeake bay watershed program the white house is depriving the chesapeake bay region of a critical opportunity to make significant progress in partnership with farmers and forest landowners in advancing water quality goals progress that will benefit all of us who depend on clean water
2340661 but beyond the region these cuts hurt the nation because other high priority watersheds stand to benefit significantly from lessons learned here on how to implement a farm bill program for maximum water quality benefits by setting clear priorities and leveraging partnerships to get the job done on the ground
2340662 investing in agricultural conservation is by far and away the most cost effective approach to reducing pollution loads to our nations largest most productive and most treasured estuary the chesapeake bay by establishing the chesapeake bay provision in the 2008 farm bill congress accomplished its greatest stride in decades towards cleaning the bays waters it is disappointing that this administration continues to show such a lack of concern not only for clean water but for this regions farmers and watermen for whom this federal support is so critical the bay community therefore must once again rise up together to ensure that these dollars ultimately remain as congress intended

2340681 the man who can make hard things easy is the educator
2340682 i believe that the only true education comes through the stimulation of the childs powers by the demands of the social situations in which he finds himself
2340683 i believe that the psychological and social sides are organically related and that education cannot be regarded as a compromise between the two or a superimposition of one upon the other
2340684 education in our times must try to find whatever there is in students that might yearn for completion and to reconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek that completion
2340685 to reconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek that completion
2340686 getting things done is not always what is most important there is value in allowing others to learn even if the task is not accomplished as quickly efficiently or effectively
2340687 what usually happens in the educational process is that the faculties are dulled overloaded stuffed and paralyzed so that by the time most people are mature they have lost their innate capabilities

2340704 the sports authority of india has proved once again how the north east is discriminated against we manipuris are hurt if monika devi is not sent then we would appeal to the four manipuri athletes and coaches who have gone over to beijing as part of the indian contingent to return
2340705 the sai authorities used an old dope test report that too controversial to drop monika from the squad her last three tests had come out negative besides why was the decision announced at the last moment

2340709 in case firs are not registered in time or steps are not taken by the police the magistrate concerned would be justified in initiating contempt proceedings against such delinquent officers and punish them for violation of its orders and award stringent punishment like sentence of imprisonment against them
2340710 disciplinary authority would be quite justified in initiating departmental proceedings and suspending them in contemplation of the same
2340711 the authorities were acting on a warrant issued based on the information they had at that time the warrant was for permission to search the premises the special operations team that supported us made that decision about the necessity of entry at the point of being on the scene
2340712 weve done these similar kinds of operations over and over again to the tune of removing billions of dollars of drugs from the community without people or animals being harmed we dont want any of our operations to result in the injury or loss of anybody and certainly not animals i would say that the dogs presented a threat

2340722 corbett is one of the worst cases of commercial interests versus tiger conservation the ntca believes that all tourism from both buffer and core zones should be phased out from tiger reserves
2340723 tourism is an important byproduct of the reserve and it helps conservation we will conduct a scientific study on the number of resorts here and involve the resort owners in dialogue

2340797 im guess im still a yuppie lefty from the inner city at the end of the day i dont need to learn its lesson but i can totally respect what youre doing and how those who need to learn it will benefit
2340798 i think it needs to be broken down into real simple ideas for me i dont want to make a movie for somebody who smokes a pipe and wears an ascot or is at the protests
2340799 i want to make a film for as wide an audience as possible not for someone whos on one side of an isle and hopefully through comedy and through the way we tell a story and through making it not complex or something real deep that you have to be well educated or read the newspaper every day to understand you can reach a real general audience i want the guy who sees the dark knight to be the same guy who sees where in the world is osama bin laden you know because its fun and its entertaining and its a movie
2340800 we have this whole idea of things having to be highbrow
2340801 and i dont buy into that i think if you really want to reach people you have to make it something that everybody likes
2340802 people like chocolate and vanilla and i like chocolate and vanilla so i think you have to really make it easy and at the same time make it cool
2340803 anything else would be a lie and i think would ultimately produce a shallow piece of work that would truly be smug because id have the audacity to somehow think i communicate what i communicate with complete intellectual objectivity theres your irony
2340804 if youre a knowledgeable lefty then its not telling you anything you dont already know and its doing so in a fairly uninteresting way if youre one of the great bogan unwashed specifically in america then using sub titles means that audience wont watch it
2340805 thats the thing about us evil advertising people the response is part of the actual material
2340806 okay so he doesnt deal with complex models of thought and analysis and he leaves stuff out etc etc and you can oull apart his arguments easily
2340807 as well as this your confusing two categories audiences and writers of course audiences dont need qualifications id suggest that its better if writers do
2340808 do these people actually think that the rest should be able to understand things on their terms
2340809 perhaps theres a figure at work here thats not being examined critically or self reflexively

2340829 the shin bet has leaked material which is part of the evidence that should have been supplied to the defendants legal representative the media received this material before the lawyer of the accused did the shin bet is not allowed to leak material it goes against good taste and violates proper regulations
2340830 he is a young man i dont sense any mental health problems
2340831 the question is how do you define a real threat the fact that hizbullah was attempting to use kashkush to recruit others asking him to locate people with financial problems or drug addicts with a view to exploit those weaknesses to get information out is very serious
2340832 the fact that the suspect knew the identify of the organization he was dealing with and that he knew what its goals were before meeting with its operatives is serious enough
2340833 hizbullah is interested in what is happening here and their targeting of arab israel is natural because they are citizens and are free to move around here so its fair to assume that this type of recruitment is a main goal for hizbullah

2340900 we have worked with all the leading candidates in the past
2340901 acorns members have deep appreciation and respect for senators clinton and edwards and their work on behalf of our communities what it came down to was that senator obama is the candidate who best understands and can effect change on the issues acorn cares about like stopping foreclosures enacting fair and comprehensive immigration reform and building stronger and safer communities across america
2340902 thats what i did for three and half years before i went to law school the reason i moved to chicago was to organize so this is something that i know personally the work you do and the importance of it
2340903 i think he will commit himself to providing us the necessary path for low income and moderate income families to improve their lives
2340904 hes on the same level as we are and sees our issues as we do
2340905 we regularly receive calls from normal middle class people who want to see their money have more of a direct impact
2340906 you could call me up and say you only have 50 to spare and id ask you what the issues are that concern you lets imagine you say third world poverty what are the causes of that literacy womens rights or a lack of them and then we can find you a project
2340907 i found that too many charities force people to give by making them feel guilty for not giving
2340908 and then they fail to let people know how their donation has been spent i want my site to make it easier for charities to rectify this
2340909 one billion people are now connected thanks to the web
2340910 and instead of having to go to one big centralised bureaucracy such as the red cross or oxfam we can now go to the edge and take control its a radical concept and large charities dont really want to have to deal with it

2340920 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us
2340921 we have heard a great deal this year about the need for change
2340922 but at the same time we are told that one thing cannot change namely the abortion regime of roe vs wade
2340923 it is time that we demand real change and real change means the end of roe vs wade
2340924 abortion is different abortion is the killing of the innocent on a massive scale
2340925 it is time to put away the arguments of political spin masters that only serve to justify abortion killing
2340926 end the political manipulation of catholic voters by abortion advocates
2340927 it is time to stop creating excuses for pro abortion candidates catholics should no longer be asked to be partners in the abortion regime by voting for politicians who support abortion
2340928 we will never succeed in building a culture of life if we continue to vote for politicians who defend and support a culture of death
2340929 it is time that catholics shine a bright line of separation between themselves and all those politicians of every political party who defend the abortion regime of roe vs wade
2340930 imagine if this year millions of catholic voters simply said no no to every candidate of every political party who supports abortion
2340931 its time we stop accommodating pro abortion politicians and its time we start demanding that they accommodate us

2340943 china now can afford an arms race with taiwan the islands economy will collapse first if it wants to lock in such a race with china
2340944 our real concern is us intervention should there be a military conflict across the taiwan strait given its small size no matter how many weapons it buys from the us the taiwanese military could hardly defend itself without the help of uncle sam
2340945 the us is well aware of the possibility that the technologies in weapons it sells to taiwan could pass to china sooner or later in one way or another so it never wants to sell its most advanced weapons to taiwan
2340946 policy makers in washington are not fools who certainly would have taken this possibility into consideration when they decide on what weapons to sell to taiwan

2341180 gas disks to gas giants simulating the birth of planetary systems
2341181 but we now know that these other planetary systems dont look like the solar system at all
2341182 the shapes of the exoplanets orbits are elongated not nice and circular planets are not where we expect them to be many giant planets similar to jupiter known as hot jupiters are so close to the star they have orbits of mere days clearly we needed to start fresh in explaining planetary formation and this greater variety of planets we now see
2341183 such a turbulent history would seem to leave little room for the sedate solar system and our simulations show exactly that
2341184 conditions must be just right for the solar system to emerge
2341185 we now better understand the process of planet formation and can explain the properties of the strange exoplanets weve observed
2341186 we also know that the solar system is special and understand at some level what makes it special
2341187 the solar system had to be born under just the right conditions to become this quiet place we see the vast majority of other planetary systems didnt have these special properties at birth and became something very different
2341188 many clients already use the data from nielsen homescan as a basis for strategic planning and in managing a great number of their marketing plans so it is a logical step for us to integrate this data into our system

2341209 deporting christians for worshipping in their private homes shows that king abdullahs speech is mere rhetoric and his country is deceiving the international community about their desire for change and reconciliation
2341210 the first officer to enter the house after breaking down the main gate pointed a pistol at the christians and ordered them to hand over their resident permits and mobile phones
2341211 the other 11 police followed quickly and started searching the entire house the confiscated an electronic drum set an offering box with 500 saudi riyal in it 130 20 bibles and a few christian books
2341212 they later changed the charge to holding a dance party and collecting money to support terrorism
2341213 during the raid the police mocked questioned and harassed the christians for four hours
2341214 then they took them to a police station where the head of the station interrogated them the head of the police then wrote down their statements in arabic and forced the christians who are immigrants and not able to read or write arabic to sign the statements

2341221 social actions goal is to help individuals and orgs use social media to plan implement and support peer to peer social change campaigns
2341222 what were trying to do is aggregate actionable opportunities across a range of social action platforms like kiva donorschoose firstgiving change org and others and then create a single search interface for people to find their way to the actions across the sector were looking at a very wide of action not all of which are connected to or benefit 501 3 registered charities i just point out although many of them do so actions defined as perhaps a fundraising campaign that someone can contribute to initiated by another individual it could be a petition that either a nonprofit has created or an individual has created to gauge interest in a certain outcome or policy change it could be an offline meetup where a bunch of people just go somewhere to protest or make something good happen or it could be just committing on an individual basis to go out and do something every day turn your lights off when youre not in the house that sort of thing so were defining action in a very broad sense it could also be making a loan to somebody like through the kiva platform make loans to entrepreneurs in the developing world so that wed consider a social action because theres some kind of community uplift that comes out of it
2341223 wouldnt it be great if more people could find the actions listed on your site to do that you should do what bloggers do and create an rss feed incidentally ill take this rss feed and id like to add it add it to my system that aggregates actionable opportunities and so there you had an opportunity to create the perception of collaboration among the series of platforms even though they didnt necessarily know or intend to collaborate with one another so if you go to the social actions website now it very much looks like a collaboration of these 19 platforms to create a single data set of the actionable opportunities on their site all they had to do was actually simply publish a single rss feed that process took about eight months to get 19 platforms to create that rss feed
2341224 long term vision is putting individuals in a position to be full partners at the table with institutions whether theyre governmental non governmental or corporate in affecting social change one other point that i dont want to be shy about or neglect to point out is i see this whole project personally as this is something that we talked about corey when we first met at nten 07 as somewhat of a critique although a very proactive and positive one of the overly consumer society that were living in so the reluctance to put advertising in the mix of social actions comes out of an understanding of our project very much as a critique of consumerism in alot of ways so we want there to be a ubiquity not of advertising in social media but of actions an invitation to be growing and effective agents of change not in any superficial way but in a very profound and longlasting way
2341225 one of our tasks for the summer will be to define our policies and procedures and that involves who we would recognize as a social action platforms as well as to define what we would do if a social action platform doesnt do what it says it does a rogue social action platform i want there to be a very large tent so i believe there will be companies social action platforms that will be nonprofit initiatives there will be entirely open source kind of institutionless software sites that produce actionable opportunities right now there isnt a clearly defined criteria but we do want whatever content to be on those systems as actionable opportunities that an individual can become a part of and we want there to be some deliverable in the way of actual social change that comes out of it whether its on a very tiny scale making someone feel better or happier about themselves or a very large scale preventing massive war of some kind so anything with social change built into it that counts as an action as far as im concerned
2341226 i knew that question was coming and i have alot of phrases that motivate me and keep me going

2341244 this inability of the administration to spend its funds is a serious indictment on the ebrahim rasool regime
2341245 this proves yet again that the anc has been busy with internal politics rather than doing their jobs
2341246 this crisis is now further compounded by the recent executive council reshuffle and the fact that every portfolio has been changed bar one
2341247 the new mecs will probably need time to acquaint themselves with their departments and will be loathe to spend their budgets
2341248 i am convinced that the reshuffle is to create an excuse for non delivery so that the skwatsha team can focus on using their mec budgets for election purposes and not service delivery

2341255 new vehicle buyers are looking for the latest technologies in audio systems and the presence of features such as satellite radio and navigation systems will only increase as manufacturers try to meet consumer demand
2341256 for instance nearly 60 percent of consumers say they want a navigation system on their next vehicle and 66 percent of consumers want the ability to play mp3 files to meet or exceed consumer expectations manufacturers will need to focus on incorporating high tech features in multimedia systems while avoiding increases in problem levels
2341257 we are studying this issue so we can put an end to this phenomenon
2341258 there are different religious opinions regarding the marriages which is why we need the government to settle the issue through legislation
2341259 islam has stipulated that both parties agree to the marriage contract
2341260 the woman must express real consent to the suitor and a guardian must not impose his choice of husband on her or force his son to marry someone he doesnt want
2341261 can enter a marriage contract with a 1 year old girl not to mention 9 years 7 years or 8 years
2341262 this is just a contract indicating consent and the guardian in this case must be the father
2341263 isnt it better to marry his daughter to a man with whom she can stay and who can protect her and support her and when she reaches the proper age have sex with her who says all men are ferocious wolves
2341264 a marriage official should not conclude a marriage contract without the womans agreement and without her signature

2341278 im 100 percent certain that the fatwa council will not come out in favour something which conflicts with european law the council wasnt able to deal with the question of homosexuality this time but it thinks that subject is quite relevant and wants to look at the matter more
2341279 its very important to have the european fatwa council with us in difficult matters like this i am not in favour of the death penalty but there are islamic texts that various people understand differently this is why we need to know the attitude of the authority before we make a decision

2341335 its a popular topic however i havent given really much thought to these soaps
2341336 i skipped 15 episodes and when i returned i found that nothing new took place and so i decided to quit if the media stops all this fuss then the addiction would go away there is no need to force people to stop watching the soaps just give them time and they will quit themselves
2341337 i became curious when these programs were being mentioned in the press and i started watching them i found nothing special there wasnt anything attractive in the stars and what they present is far from reality
2341338 being aggressive in dealing with such cases is just fruitless this imam has not done anything positive the people in the town would simply look for another way to watch the series
2341339 however that has not stopped them on the contrary more dishes appeared on buildings

2341372 one night two men arrived at the abandoned house on the border between libya and tunisia in which we were waiting to leave for the sea there was some 40 of us and these people who wore uniforms took me away i was taken to a deserted house where they raped me
2341373 when they freed me and i returned to the group i was received by two other women who embraced me and the expression on their faces showed that they had suffered the same abuse
2341374 we left our country on foot the group included some 50 people we crossed the desert of sudan here the men who led the group told us they wanted more money to continue the trip otherwise they said they would leave us to die in the desert some of us had some money and paid them others could not pay and any woman that did not have money was raped in order to be allowed to continue with the group
2341375 while we are in support of the objectives of combating crime and corruption including that within the sa police service we see no reason why these cannot be addressed within the saps
2341376 this led to the rights of individuals being compromised and there was a growing tendency for officers to be diverted from the fight against crime to political campaigns against certain individuals
2341377 as a separate force they are not subject to public accountability enough but more a law unto themselves
2341378 serious violations of the constitution and the rule of law
2341379 this is quite simply a political decision taken by the ruling party to protect its leaders from any further criminal investigations
2341380 their faults however certainly do not require such a drastic measure as shutting down their operations and moving them into the structures of the saps

2341399 i started in london and ended up working in an extreme sport company doing tv and film i saved cash and visited family in south africa after three years of working in london on my first round the world ticket
2341400 just before christmas i found the first lump in my tummy which turned out to be neuroblastoma cancer that was a bit of a shock on new years eve i had surgery then six months of chemo then i carried on with my round the world ticket
2341401 on my first day back in london i found another lump it was the same feeling and very disappointing as i thought that chemo and surgery had covered all the bases
2341402 the following day thinking about all the processes i had gone through the first time round took away a lot of the fear i then decided to use myself as the subject matter for the project and thats what ive been doing this year
2341403 i also want to expose all the treatment options ive discovered since i was given a terminal diagnosis a year ago i dont take the diagnosis too seriously i dont think i can or id be dead by now then they gave me four to six months to live

2341407 los cholultecas que nunca se hab an visto con los mexicanos en campo nunca se hab a enfrentado militarmente quisieron probar su ventura y valor

2341409 que no tuviesen pena en ello y que la muerte de su hermano moctezuma le pesaba por perder hombres tan valientes pero que morir en honra y defensa de la patria iban matizados y esmaltados con el matiz y esmalte de su alta sangre y valor adornados de piedras preciosas y de precisos plumajes de su grandeza y hechos valerosos y que aquel era el fin que l y todos hab an de desear pues no murieron como mujeres tras los tizones y fones sino con la espada en la mano matizando con el rosicler de su sangre y de la ajena las yerbas del campo y los rayos del sol que por ellos se extienden y que de esto se gloriaba y estaba muy ufano

2341414 what obama voted for was a budget resolution that would have allowed most of the provisions of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts to expire in particular the resolution would allow the 25 percent tax bracket to return to its pre 2001 level of 28 percent that bracket kicks in at 32 550 for an individual or 65 100 for a married couple but as those of you who have filled out a 1040 know thats not actually how income taxes work we dont pay taxes on our total earnings we pay them based on our taxable income the urban brookings tax policy centers eric toder told factcheck org that people with taxable income of 32 000 would have a total income greater than that in 2008 anyone filing taxes with single status would be entitled to a standard deduction of 5 450 as well as a personal exemption of 3 500 so to have a taxable income high enough to reach the 25 percent bracket an individual would need to earn at least 41 500 in total income while a married couple would need a combined income of at least 83 000
2341415 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
2341416 campaign aides to senator obama today called the charge that he voted for tax hikes on people making only 32 000 a year quote bogus they circulated an analysis stating that the resolution that obama had voted for would not have increase taxes on single taxpayer making less than 41 500 a year in total income
2341417 vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year
2341418 factcheck org a nonpartisan web site said the vote was on a budget resolution to raise taxes on people making 41 500 a year the 32 000 figure it said was the amount of taxable income those people had
2341419 would have allowed tax rates to return to pre 2001 levels meaning that an individual with taxable income of about 32 000 would have faced a tax increase
2341420 at issue is obamas vote on a non binding budget resolution in march that called for president bushs tax cuts to expire such a step would have allowed tax rates to return to pre 2001 levels meaning that an individual with taxable income of about 32 000 would have faced a tax increase taxable income is whats left after taxpayers account for deductions
2341421 the senate voted to stand up for working families in illinois and throughout the nation
2341422 today the senate voted to stand up for working families in illinois and throughout the nation by rejecting the failed policies of the bush administration and moving our country back on track to fiscal discipline our country needs change and this budget is an important step in the right direction i commend house and senate leaders for working together to move this legislation through congress

2341426 obama statement on the senates passage of the fy 2009 budget
2341427 obamas transformation if you go by his campaign so far would mean higher income taxes higher social security taxes higher investment taxes higher corporate taxes massive new domestic spending and a healthcare plan that perhaps could be the next step to a full scale single payer system is that what most americans want someone who will fulfill a democratic policy wish list
2341428 obamas proposal would impose social security taxes on income above 250 000 per year he would continue to exempt income between 102 000 and 250 000 from social security taxes
2341429 i would roll back the bush tax cuts for those making over 250 000
2341430 are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
2341431 changes in the individual income tax affect most businesses in the united states that is because taxes on business earnings are often paid through the individual income tax when passed through to business owners the business income from sole proprietorships farm proprietorships partnerships s corporations etc is all taxed at the owners individual income tax rates this year 34 million business owners are expected to receive this type of income and pay tax on this income through the individual income tax these businesses are typically small and often entrepreneurial in nature and a source of innovation and risk taking in the economy moreover these business owners are frequently subject to the highest individual income tax rates
2341432 sen obama wants to raise the long term capital gains rate for families making more than 250 000 to around 20 percent or somewhat higher but not above the 28 percent level it reached during the reagan presidency an obama economic adviser says the same rate would apply to most dividend income for these investors

2341434 what we ought to tax is dirty energy like coal and to a lesser extent natural gas
2341435 and i found this fascinating maria that on the issue of taxes he looked to insulate himself by saying that if in fact economic conditions justify the fact that it might harm the economy he might be willing to hold off some of his tax increases when he takes office in january lets take a listen to barack obama
2341436 some of those you could possibly defer but i think the basic principle of restoring fairness to our economy and encouraging bottom up economic growth is important so heres what we know we know that over the last decade or so that more than half of the economic growth has been captured by the top one percent of u s citizens that means the other 99 percent have seen their effective incomes go down that is not a recipe for long term economic growth
2341437 even though senator obamas plan eliminates individual income taxes for seniors with incomes less than 50 000 his plan would raise taxes for almost 10 million senior households over a third of the total not shown in table on average seniors would face a tax increase of about 2 percent of income

2341439 rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide
2341440 most debate over whether to extend the reduced rates on dividends and capital gains has focused on the tax benefits of these cuts to high income taxpayers what has been largely ignored is the impact these tax policies have on corporations decisions on how best to distribute their income to shareholders including senior citizens who rely most on the stable flow of income that dividends provide a recent tax foundation analysis illustrated that a large number of those benefiting from dividends are seniors and those on the verge of retirement see www taxfoundation org a further analysis of these seniors earning dividends reveals that lower income seniors who file tax returns depend more heavily on dividend income than high income seniors

2341540 i tried to look at how many things i was trying to cram into my life in an average week and realised that id been trying to cram in too much so i decided to cut back
2341541 that very simple idea of less is more is at the core of what slow is about
2341542 one of the ironies nowadays is that were all so impatient that we even want to slow down fast
2341543 i think that slowing down is a process that never ends its a bit like being a recovering alcoholic in some ways you always have to be on guard because its a natural human instinct especially in a fast forward world with technology and internet everywhere to go too fast and want to speed up for me when i had that wake up call that i was just racing through my life instead of actually living it i thankfully didnt fall into that trap of trying to slow down fast i think i realised that it was something deeper that it wasnt just a simple lifestyle shift that i read about in a newspaper and would be all done and dusted in a matter of days there were a lot more layers to drill down through for me it was and continues to be a kind of process to get back in touch with my inner tortoise
2341544 i began saying no to work projects which would have been unthinkable to me before
2341545 it was still a scary thing to do but pretty early on i realised that saying no doesnt close a door forever it actually does the opposite
2341546 there were quite a lot of raised eyebrows and a lot of snickering because ive always been seen in my circles as quite a fast person for me to be embracing slow seems faintly absurd or even dishonest
2341547 but in many ways it makes perfect sense in the fact that by being the person i am this message is more easily received by a lot of people from me rather than from a buddhist monk sitting on a hill somewhere saying the same thing i think it helps that im living in a fast city and i play fast sports and i talk fast people had to get used to the fact that i had to start saying no to things like social events so that took a little explanation and at work i had to explain that just because i was slowing down it didnt mean i was going to miss my deadline
2341548 you dont have to leave a city and go and live in a shack in the outback and grow organic vegetables in order to slow down you can be slow in tokyo new york london and toronto and you can be slow in any job granted some are harder than others but you can do it
2341549 it takes a lot of courage to put my ideas out there and be sure about them
2341550 in some ways theres a safety in journalism in that i never wrote columns or put myself in my articles my natural inclination is to show rather than tell and even now i dont like the idea of standing on a soapbox and telling people what they should think and how to live their lives the hardest thing for me has been to prescribe ways of doing things to people in some ways ive always struggled with that in my books
2341551 whether its seeing someone helping someone else to cross the road or sharing a laugh with someone on the train i really find its the little stuff that inspires me its the building of all the little things that create the big things in life i like to stay close to the ground and when youre close to the ground thats when you see the small things those are the things that excite me and make me laugh
2341552 for me cooking is the ultimate zen experience i love everything about cooking from the simple rhythmic chopping to the sound of garlic sizzling i like the experience of cooking for other people and sitting down at a table and sharing things with them
2341553 i also do meditation which is peaceful in an obvious way and i love being outdoors but in a lot of ways its when i am cooking that i am most at peace
2341554 how can we possibly persuade you that attention must be paid to this music and that youll thank me if youd just give in

2341582 can retailers have a happy christmas during the credit crunch
2341583 high street retailers overtook their online only counterparts for the first time during december 2006 but quickly fell behind again for most of 2007
2341584 however when the high street overtook again last christmas the gap was even greater than before and during 2008 the online only retailers only managed to edge ahead during february given the 2 6 year on year decline in actual physical visits to retailers reported by experian footfall for july it looks like high street retailers will be more reliant than ever on their online operations this christmas
2341585 can retailers have a happy christmas during the credit crunch

2341591 yes indeed i am now the copywriter for a major international organization because my boss noticed me typing my nano story at lunch
2341592 who has time for work when its nano season not me a humble call center employee i would sit at my work desk typing little notes and scenes from my story between phone calls and banging out 1000 words during my lunch break on my ancient computer my co workers would come in to eat lunch and occasionally ask questions about why in the world i was trying to write a novel in 30 days but mostly they left me alone but lo and behold someone noticed and i got promoted yes indeed i am now the copywriter for a major international organization because my boss noticed me typing my nano story at lunch the first issue of the newsletter that i co wrote will be going out to more than 40 000 people in a few weeks and i write a weekly e newsletter that is sent to hundreds of thousands also this past november i was active on the viddler nanowrimo group many of us from the group have stayed in touch via twitter and skype one night while chatting we decided to meet up and six weeks later found ourselves in san francisco five of us were able to go on the trip and were already planning our next trip we spent four days touring the city hanging out enjoying the weather and just having a blast being together the highlight of the trip was visiting the office of letters and light we spent about ten minutes outside the office just geeking out over it so not only has nanowrimo been an insane amount of fun but it got me a great new job and a circle of friends that i wouldnt trade for anything in the world
2341593 writing was something for me to muse about while i tread water out in that cruel ocean
2341594 when i was fifteen only less than a year ago while other teenagers went out to gatherings and clubs to party the night away with their friends i was at home fighting for my life in a way that no one should have to i had an enemy that i couldnt even see nobody hurt me nobody manipulated me my enemy was inside me and every single day was a battle to survive it was depression the days seemed twenty times longer than they should have been i felt exhausted all day but couldnt sleep at night i withdrew into myself it grew so bad that at nights id sit for up to an hour on the kitchen floor the knives above me in their block tempting me so much sometimes i held them and examined them sometimes i even tested how sharp they were life i believed was pointless not like the knives up there on the bench while some people would shrug that thought off and go on with life it threatened to consume me i wanted to live for something but i told myself i wanted to die yet i kept going the days seemed so dark and in my memory they still are but i can remember one thing one of my best friends taya pulling me through each day talking to me comforting me giving me tiny tools to survive giving me something to float with on the cold sea before the rescuers came in stories main characters usually have one person usually a love interest who stumbles across them and saves them i wasnt so lucky the only person who could save me was too far away to do more than throw that rubber ring to me she could do nothing but watch as i clung to it what seemed like the darkest night of my life i finally called for help i went upstairs at three in the morning and asked my mum for a hug she saw how distressed i was she took me to the doctor who recommended us to specialists i was put on medication i had a relapse on new years day this year when i decided to hell with this and sliced my arm up with a broken glass but aside from that it was a smooth ride while a lot of depression patients still fight their battles years after diagnosis im already free ive been off medication for two months and only once have i ever thought that i might need them again and that was a brief thought since then i havent looked back ive turned from a pessimist to an optimist to such an extent that its starting to annoy people looking back on it i realize its nano that brought me here i was thirteen years old when i discovered it thirteen and bored writing had become something that was only on the side for me dreams of being the next j k rowling had been replaced by realitys dont you dare even think you can do that attitude along with you cant do it writing was a dim candle that almost blew out i never finished anything i started but when i discovered nano i decided what the hell nanowrimo turned it into a raging bonfire it grew from a hobby into a full blown passion i met the sporkers and later the best friend who saved my life writing was something for me to muse about while i tread water out in that cruel ocean the sole star in the sky one day id be a writer i told myself while i was out there the depression said otherwise but that didnt stop that star shining nano saved my life it saved me from myself i cant even imagine what would have happened to me back in those long months if i didnt have writing or my best friend t with me i dont think i would have gone to mum for that hug id have done a lot more damage that new years day if i wasnt dead id be close to it ive learned to live again im starting to thrive and im daring to dream big again i wont be sitting in anyones seat i wont be the next anything ill set the new standards just you wait chris baty saved me that day he suggested writing 50 000 words in a month a lot of people wouldnt have voiced the idea even if they had it theyd have wanted to save face but voicing it could save so much more thank you chris lt 3 so much oh new standards or not im still going to nudge rowling out of her seat just you wait

2341613 when i got to the top i had an overwhelming feeling of gratitude this lasted for less than a minute and then i had an overwhelming feeling of shit i need to get out of here at the top you are only halfway and i was fully aware that most people die on the way down a storm was coming it was time to move not reminisce
2341614 i didnt jump at this opportunity as much as i hesitantly edged towards it in the end i knew it was a once in a lifetime opportunity i decided that i would be honest and straightforward just the way i am every day with our clients and if a potential client sees me on air and thinks i wouldnt want to work with him then they would have never been a client anyway

2342324 i dont know how many times ive got to respond to rumor and innuendo
2342325 i have no control over that ive stated what my intentions are and they really havent changed so i dont know what the issue is and i dont know why people keep asking about it what they talk about over there is their business but whats happening here is my business and our business and thats what were focused on
2342326 i want to make it perfectly clear this press conference is about the miami dolphins and its about the miami dolphins football team
2342327 its not about any other individual and whatever is out there were talking about our football team here the focus is how we can improve our team
2342328 i cant tell you how pleased and honored i am to be your coach at the university of alabama the spirit and enthusiasm that has been demonstrated to myself and my family has been phenomenal since we arrived here yesterday afternoon it certainly is appreciated
2342329 it takes trust respect for each other in what everyones role is what they need to do thats the first thing thats important is for us to work together
2342330 and it was drizzling rain on this january day when nick saban said the university of alabama would be his

2342334 he told me look we wont be remembering this at your thirtieth wedding anniversary
2342335 of course i start to breathe after somebody passed gas

2342696 do you think they slimmed your dad down for that picture
2342697 personally im disappointed in nikons coolpix efforts since the 8800 and the p6000 actually increases that disappointment my advice is to look at the ricoh gx 200 and the panasonic lx 3 if you want a quality compact camera in the near term both have true raw support both are excellent photographer centric cameras and with care using raw conversion both produce fine results at low iso values looks like i need a new coolpix bumper sticker to add to my collection skip the p6000

2342703 we couldnt be more excited to see andrei arlovski and josh barnett faceoff for the right to take on fedor for the wamma world heavyweight championship

2342708 andrei is a very talented fighter with a lot of skill and heart

2342750 we are such natural performers we end to make a huge impression even if were on the stage for only a short time
2342751 youre always meeting interesting people doing interesting things and smelling interesting smells
2342752 this was the first time we ever attacked a nation that hadnt attacked us
2342753 it was written in their koran that all nations which had not acknowledged the prophet were sinners whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to plunder and enslave and that every mussulman who was slain in this warfare was sure to go to paradise

2342762 on my first day back in london i found another lump it was the same feeling and very disappointing as i thought that chemo and surgery had covered all the bases
2342763 the following day thinking about all the processes i had gone through the first time round took away a lot of the fear i then decided to use myself as the subject matter for the project and thats what ive been doing this year
2342764 i also want to expose all the treatment options ive discovered since i was given a terminal diagnosis a year ago i dont take the diagnosis too seriously i dont think i can or id be dead by now then they gave me four to six months to live

2342997 we must look at the substantial successes we have been able to achieve but also reflect on how far we have to go
2342998 governments in the past have been complicit in genocides land seizures massive environmental degradation and many other human rights abuses because indigenous peoples were denied their fundamental rights and freedoms
2342999 this shows how far we still have to go to make sure that states acknowledge and protect indigenous peoples rights for if they continue not to we have many examples of the grave results

2343022 is being attractive wealthy and having a high profile job a recipe for relationship infidelity is it possible to be attractive wealthy high profile and faithful
2343023 yes you are terrific and can have anything you want
2343024 having been in the nba for over a decade with much success i personally never found it difficult to be faithful to my wife i dont agree that having a high profile job provides an excuse for infidelity in the sports world you have to make sure that youre conveying to others that youre off the market period yes people will continue to make advances but the onus is on the athlete to remove themselves from any conversation or situation that does not respect their marriage family or relationship
2343025 it is absolutely possible to have a monogamous relationship with a professional athlete my marriage to doug is a testament to that although i am the wife of a professional athlete ive never viewed our marriage on those terms our love and commitment to one another is more important than the money and notoriety that comes with his profession or nba contract
2343026 what motivated him to do this and believe that he could keep it quiet

2343034 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2343035 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2343038 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2343039 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target

2343050 we have residents that have lived in atherton more than 40 years along the tracks
2343051 a lot of the concern is that the authoritys board wasnt given accurate information about the relative impacts of the two alignments

2343102 now two points one they know theyre lying about what my energy plan is but the other thing is theyre making fun of a step that every expert says would absolutely reduce our oil consumption by 3 to 4 percent its like these guys take pride in being ignorant

2343108 well actually insiders say hillary was never on obamas vp list obama felt it would have been too much to put her on the ticket bad enough to worry about jesse cutting them off didnt want to worry about hillary breaking them too you know what im saying
2343109 and earlier this week john mccain had a small mole moved from his temple

2343211 i i can see but you try to but you cant make it work
2343212 i do know that three things are really important 28 29 and 30
2343213 look grandma we think youll forget about the kettle one day because youre old and forgetful
2343214 oh how nice i never liked that old kettle anyway
2343215 a primeira irregularidade que aponto a ca a s bruxas nos meios de comunica o social que come ou nos media mu ulmanos mesmo antes do conflito armado e que me nomeou criminoso de guerra
2343216 there is so much pressure to be like everyone else
2343217 this year i think i am going to spend 300
2343218 one of the things ive noticed as a mom is ive been horrible about making my kids read
2343219 if they read just 15 minutes a night that gets them focused back on their reading skills
2343220 or for kids that arent readers yet parents can make sure they are reading to their children
2343221 slowly move it back every few days work it back earlier by a half hour so its not a huge jolt
2343222 this can really decrease anxiety and gives kids a sense of control
2343223 if you drop them off for the first week and then they start riding the bus they havent gone through the same things other kids do
2343224 discuss what else they can do and have them try to figure out options
2343225 they might be able to charge a lunch or talk to a teacher life is about problem solving and helping a child understand options teaches them to problem solve what you ultimately want for your child is an independent individual accountable for their actions
2343226 i keep numbers of classmates from the previous year and then my daughter can call them if they havent kept in touch over the summer and find out who might be in her class
2343227 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
2343228 no one really knows yet if and when iran will get the system
2343229 russia will have to think real hard before delivering this system to iran which is possibly on the brink of conflict with either israel or the us since if the system is delivered an ew electronic warfare system will likely be developed to neutralize it and if that happens it would be catastrophic not only for iran but also for russia
2343230 no country will want to buy the system if it is proven to be ineffective
2343231 for these reasons russia may not deliver it in the end to iran
2343232 she wakes up in the middle of the night screaming
2343233 her arms legs her body she is always tense and frightened
2343234 i have one question for mr karzai if this was your little girl what would you do
2343235 these criminals are never brought to justice because police and government authorities are either involved or they cant handle the crimes
2343236 with criminals and warlords in the political scene we cannot expect justice to be served
2343237 in many cases of violence against children there is a sense of impunity people continue to violate childrens rights without any sense of feeling that they will be held accountable
2343238 i cant think of any country in the world in which children suffer more than in afghanistan
2343239 in all our meetings with children it takes a lot of time to make them smile that to me shows that there is not happiness in their hearts
2343240 even if they had the laws it is impossible to implement
2343241 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
2343242 do not stay on the same bus on the same train on the same plane in the same buildings or any place the chinese are

2343249 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
2343250 i have no comment about an honor killing or whether its true or relevant at all
2343251 it does a disservice to the man his family and his children
2343252 they do not leave their customs behind when they cross borders the customs come right with them
2343253 if any woman in the family in any way does something that dishonors the family the whole family is dishonored they are the laughingstock of the whole community because they dont know how to control their women
2343254 and the only way this blight on their honor can be eradicated is to kill the one who has committed the crime
2343255 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism
2343256 the fact is there is a new generation of angry americans who happen to be american and who happen to not like what is becoming the more islam is reviled and connected to terrorism the more kids my age and younger will turn to islam to define their perspective and their reality
2343257 t hey felt that we the group of us were coming to the to kill the president in one agents own words
2343258 the bush administration has quite a bit of blood on their hands
2343259 is it possible for us to witness a world without america and zionism

2343261 the prophet married aisha in mecca three years before the hijrah after the death of khadija at the time she was six
2343262 when the apostle came to medina he was fifty three
2343263 my mother came to me while i was being swung on a swing between two branches and got me down my nurse wiped my face with some water and started leading me when i was at the door she stopped so i could catch my breath i was then brought in while the messenger was sitting on a bed in our house my mother made me sit on his lap then the men and women got up and left the prophet consummated his marriage with me in my house when i was nine years old
2343264 the trial of salim ahmed hamdan fell short of the highest traditions of american justice and even if he files a successful appeal he would not be set free

2343266 the most important thing we learned is this hillary clinton won 8 of the last 13 primaries he is beatable
2343267 one thing people forget is how red the map is we have a chance we will pick up a good number of seats
2343268 i dont think there is any evidence at all that the vice presidential candidate affects any votes outside their own state and not much evidence they affect many votes inside their own state
2343269 the pool of votes available to democrats during tough times gets bigger in the south
2343270 whats remarkable this summer is the stability of this race in a broad sense it is similar to previous elections

2343276 while it continues to be the policy of both firms not to comment on rumors under the circumstance of information finding its way into the media the firms wanted to ensure that there were no misperceptions of reality

2343350 currently farmers have few options to reduce the contribution that livestock make to greenhouse gas production
2343351 however low emission kangaroo meat will provide an option to avoid emissions and have a positive global impact
2343352 although we are proposing an increase in kangaroo numbers and growth in the kangaroo harvesting industry the net planned effect is for a lower grazing impact
2343353 this means there will be less damage from hard hoofed livestock and maintenance of kangaroo and other wildlife habitat

2343655 god is the foundational reality not a god who is merely imagined or hypothetical but god with a human face he is god with us the god who loves even to the cross
2343656 in the face of the priority of faith in christ and of life
2343657 as a first step we can respond to this question with another what is this
2343658 according to the testimony of holy scripture the center of the life and person of jesus is his constant communication with the father
2343659 in the end only three titles remain as the communitys valid adumbration of the mystery of jesus christ lord and son of god since the title christ messiah became more and more associated with the name jesus and had little clear meaning outside a jewish milieu and since lord too was not as clear as son a further concentration took place the title son comes in the end to be the only comprehensive designation for jesus it both comprises and interprets everything else so finally the churchs confession of faith can be satisfied with this title we find it in its ultimate form in matthew in peters confession you are the christ the son of the living god mt 16 16
2343660 luke is the only one of the evangelists who begins his account by indicating the purpose of jesus ascent he went up on the mountain to pray lk 9 28 it is in the context of jesus prayer that he now explains the event that the three disciples are to witness and as he was praying the appearance of his face was altered and his clothing became dazzling white lk 9 29 the transfiguration is a prayer event it displays visibly what happens when jesus talks with this father the profound interpenetration of his being with god which then becomes pure light in his oneness with the father jesus is himself light from light the reality that he is in the deepest core of his being which peter tried to express in his confession that reality becomes perceptible to the senses at this moment jesus being in the light of god his own being light as son
2343661 shines from within he does not simply receive light but he himself is light from light
2343662 the garments of the elect are white because they have washed them n the blood of the lamb cf
2343663 without losing proper recollection without being distracted there came to my mind with extraordinary force and clarity the phrase of scripture et si exaltatus fuero a terra omnia traham ad me ipsum and i if i am lifted up from the earth will draw all things to myself jn 12 32 immediately following that escriva hears and the precise concept it is not in the sense in which scripture says it i say it to you in the sense that you put me at the summit of all human activities so that in all the places of the world there may be christians with a personal and most free dedication that they be other christs
2343664 he saul might easily have passed in the streets of jerusalem or under the porticoes of the temple he was also a compatriot if it be true as st jerome believes that sauls family was of galilean origin
2343665 the way in which the converted pharisee speaks of the lately crucified religious reformer jesus of nazareth whose work and name he but yesterday thought it a glory and a duty to annihilate and abolish is a strange phenomenon which seems to contradict all the laws of psychology and all the analogies of history paul that proud genius so conscious of his dignity so disdainful of the idols of flesh and blood is in ecstasy and adoration before his master he wishes to be his liege man his slave and also the slave of his brethren for love of him he allows no one to put him on a level with any created thing higher than the heavens vaster than the universe more powerful than death sole victor over sin the only mediator of grace and the one redeemer of the human race christ effaces all else by his splendour fills everything with his plenitude and is antecedent to the ages therefore every knee is to bend before him in heaven on earth and in hell for the most perfect of the celestial spirits recognize in him their chief their creator and their god such is the picture of jesus which the apostle soon after the passion sets before the witnesses of his life and death and even before his persecutors and executioners
2343666 the life i now live in the flesh i live by faith in the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me gal 2 20
2343667 by struggling to behave like this we clear the way to being contemplatives in the middle of the world this conviction will lead us always to concern ourselves with others for love of god and not to think of ourselves and so at the end of the day a day lived in the midst of ordinary affairs in our home n our professions or job we will be able to say as we do our examination of conscience lord i dont know what to tell you about myself i have only thought about others for you using the words of st paul we could translate this as vivo autem iam non ego vivit vero in me christus
2343668 this mutual interpenetration between christ and the christian characteristic of pauls teaching completes his d iscourse on faith in fact although faith unites us closely to christ it emphasizes the distinction between us and him but according to paul christian life also has an element that we might describe as mystitrical since it entails an identification of ourselves with christ and of christ with us
2343669 those who did not like him said that he was small of body slow of tongue and cross eyed and he considered himself great with those invisible wounds he considered himself to be alter christus ipse christus yes paul the great paul thank you for this doctrine that you have left to us because the holy spirit inspired it in you you are christ paul rejoice that christians love you that they thank you for this treasure of doctrine

2343673 i didnt like putin then and i dont like him now but isnt it great that im free to say that
2343674 it is logical for putin to have himself appointed prime minister so that he can finish what he started as president
2343675 putin should have shut down those newspapers because they were printing lies about him
2343676 russia is becoming the most important automobile market in the world
2343677 the world had forgotten us but putin showed that russia is back
2343678 i got a call from a nurse at my doctors office and she said we will be most likely set for a 5 day transfer on sunday she also said our embryos our doing great but didnt give me specific numbers she also said that sometimes they do a 6 day transfer which would be monday but that it is more likely that we will have a 5 day transfer i had many other questions that i asked her so i forgot to ask her why they would do a 6 day transfer rather then a 5 day i have never heard of it before have you or any of your buddies
2343679 i had my embryo transfer on sunday and all went really well

2343722 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2343797 the carbon whales are an obscure band from the late 70s that actor paddy considine turned bob on to the 4 songs on this ep are apparently the only things they ever recorded it was never released bob really loved it so we tracked the band down and asked if we could release it the singer sounds exactly like bob

2343802 this is purely anecdotal second or even third hand but there is a story that one of the red bull drivers jumped out of his renault car and drove the ferrari car and said bloody hell true or false i dont know and that is not to point the figure at ferrari
2343803 williams believe that their problem was caused by the fuel pressure in the heavily filled tank causing excess fuel to bubble up inside the hose while toro rosso are not willing to comment beyond confirming it was not a fuel rig problem

2343805 formula one drivers concerns about the safety of kinetic energy recovery systems kers have increased because bmw sauber have not yet found out what caused their electric shock incident in jerez that is the view of grand prix drivers association gpda director mark webber who says that the kers safety debate will become much bigger if bmw sauber cannot get to the bottom of what it was that caused one of their mechanics to suffer an electric shock during testing
2343806 the mclaren is a little bit oversteery when the tyre has good grip the car with the oversteer tendency will be quicker over a single lap than a neutral or understeering car
2343807 but when you think about racing conditions especially with the temperatures we had at the hungaroring then an oversteering car will have heat generating at the rear much higher than the understeering car
2343808 looking at hungary and lewis hamiltons car behaviour after a few laps he struggled with oversteer so he was making lots of counter steering movements on the other hand the ferrari had a good balance after a few laps
2343809 we have an explanation for it especially when you consider that in the winter we were level with red bull and toyota and its just gone down
2343810 but we know where one of the main areas is and actually i have learned something in hungary which was just a small step in another direction to give us an idea if its the right thing

2343823 the german publication auto motor und sport reported this week that dennis may be looking to retire at the end of this year if his team succeed in their ambition to win the f1 world championship the magazine also suggested that dennis was so keen to achieve the title which would allow him to leave that he was focusing his teams efforts on developing this years car at the expense of work on their 2009 challenger but a mclaren spokesman has moved to dismiss the speculation about denniss future claiming that the team chiefs future plans have not changed and that there is no suggestion of them putting all their resources into 2008
2343824 in an effort to reduce costs and improve reliability the fia introduced an engine freeze which meant that in theory nothing could be done to the f1 engines but it is clear that some manufacturers looked at ways around the freeze and began to request changes to their engines necessary for reliability which had the side effect of improving performance this is old style formula 1 thinking working within the rules but pushing them to the limit felipe massas engine failure in hungary was a clear sign that risks are being taken in an effort to win
2343825 kers will inevitably spread out the grid a little that is always the way when changes are made in f1 some will gain and some will lose and the feeling is that it is those who feel that they will lose who are making the most noise about safety
2343826 estaba pensando justamente en ti porque tengo en mis manos un reportaje periodistico que habla de comportamientos chinos similares a los que has observado en canad y que me has platicado
2343827 pues anoche cen con un chino un coreano y un japones y los tres comieron con la misma rapidez hablaron con la boca llena sorbieron la sopa hicieron ruido al masticar y eructaron varias veces
2343828 la forma de vivir y proceder de los chinos contrasta con la nuestra en un mundo diverso

2343832 al comer por ejemplo les gusta absorber y no es de mala educacion pueden eructar en un restaurante y nadie hace cara de asco como ocurre en m xico cuando a alguien en una taqueria se le ocurre hacer la misma gracia
2343833 nos sonemos la nariz con un pa uelo y despues lo guardemos de nuevo en el bolso o que pongamos los pies arriba de una mesa o silla o incluso que pongamos bolsas junto a los pies o nos les peguemos demaciado a otro giremos la cabeza para mirar lacivamente a alguna chica nos aventemos o nos empujemos o que no haya chicos malos en las calles

2343839 i am deeply concerned about the central new york economy and honeywells announcement to send nearly 300 jobs overseas is alarming and harmful to this community of hardworking new yorkers it is unclear if the state of new york or the people of skaneateles falls were given a chance to make their case but it is very clear that the workers whose jobs are on the line deserve to be heard tomorrow i will send a letter to the ceo of honeywell requesting a meeting to discuss how and why this decision was made what can be done to secure an alternative to this drastic decision and honeywells long term plan for the 250 jobs that remain at the skaneateles facility during this time of economic distress and uncertainty it is imperative that we not only protect our workforce from moving overseas but innovate and create new jobs

2343860 you have to have something sacred to you and the people around you
2343861 i shared so much of my life i should have something to hold on to
2343862 this is a good decision for minnesota farmers i do understand that the high price of corn poses a problem for livestock producers but economists tell us those high prices are only due in small part to ethanol instead they are largely due to the bush coleman energy plan which is driving up input costs i dont favor pitting commodities against each other instead i support a program of emergency relief for our livestock producers ending the failed bush coleman policy of dependence on foreign oil and solving the energy crisis that is threatening our economy requires a focus on renewable energy although we are moving towards other forms of biofuels right now corn ethanol is at the forefront of our effort to build a renewable energy economy
2343863 al franken says george bush has been wrong on iraq and wrong on the economy
2343864 norm coleman supports bush almost 90 percent of the time
2343865 in a political race people will say a lot of things
2343866 theyll say norm is a rubber stamp for the president but hes been ranked as one of the most independent senators
2343867 i havent met an educator who doesnt want accountability but i havent met an educator who thinks no child left behind is working this weeks news only confirms that the failed bush coleman education policy isnt working for minnesota and that we desperately need a change i plan to make education a focus in this campaign and a focus in the senate and while norm coleman has spent six years as mr bushs teachers pet ill go to washington to stand up for minnesotas skilled educators dedicated parents and talented students
2343868 that which can be measured easily will be measured and will be deemed important that which cannot be measured easily will not be measured and will be deemed unimportant
2343869 another real problem with the horizontal gaze nystagmus test is the timing of its presence and an actual alcohol concentration the hgn as administered by the national highway transportation safety administrations nhtsa protocol for the standardized field sobriety tests sfst has been cited as the only reliable index of blood alcohol when examined for its ability to distinguish bacs under and over 04 within the 00 08 range so it is a fallacy to use this test to determine that someone may be over 08 bac what is also alarming is the fact that nystagmus can remain for some time once the bac has reached 000 in a dose response study of 89 subjects 62 of the dosed subjects exhibited nystagmus in one or both eyes at bac levels of 00 when tested immediately after all alcohol was cleared from their blood and 56 of those subjects still exhibited nystagmus one hour later in the same study it was determined from 66 healthy well rested subjects who did not consume any alcohol and completed 5 5 to 8 0 hours of sleep after being awake for 9 to 14 5 hours average 11 2 that they had distinct nystagmus in one or both eyes afterwards these same subjects were re examined with an average awake time of 24 5 hours and distinct end position nystagmus was observed in one or both eyes in 55 of the group

2343890 dui defense is a lucrative field every chance they get state legislatures are making dui financial penalties tougher instituting mandatory jail terms and lengthening suspension and revocation terms cops write duis at the slightest odor of alcohol and prosecutors are proceeding on even the weakest cases because in the current political climate they cant afford to do anything less bottom line todays dui defendant has more to lose than ever the old way of dealing with dui just doesnt cut it anymore because dui isnt what it used to be as a result defendants are willing to pay for a real defense additionally despite tougher laws designed to reduce the incidence of dui more people are arrested each year making the pool of potential clients perpetually greater if youre willing to do the work they are willing to pay for the attention a public defender may not be able to provide dui defenders at www dui1 com is the number one result on google our 1 year membership is only 380
2343891 fact 1 most dui cases are settled before going to trial because there is really no defense dui is really like a strict liability crime once you do it you are guilty
2343892 not only people losing their homes are affected the rising tide of foreclosures is driving down the value of virtually every home in minnesota this doesnt just affect jim and veronica or just north minneapolis it is affecting every area of the state and everyone who owns a house not just the people whose homes are foreclosed
2343893 what we are seeing is a downward spiral that i want to stop
2343894 he obama is going to need as many democratic u s senators as possible to make sure that his agenda gets through

2343897 norm coleman is attacking al franken for an honest mistake he made with his personal finances and fixed months ago meanwhile coleman is refusing to answer questions about a sweetheart deal he received from a washington insider connected to powerful lobbyists a matter that has already attracted the attention of the senate ethics committee unfortunately this is just one example of norm colemans all too cozy relationship with special interests a relationship that for him comes before doing the job for minnesotas middle class families we know that norm coleman isnt working for minnesotans in washington now its time to find out just who he is working for and what hes getting in return
2343898 al franken he gave speeches across the country instead of paying taxes in the states where he spoke he overpaid taxes to the state where he lived it was an honest mistake and norm coleman coleman is being investigated for paying only six hundred dollars a month rent to live in a million dollar dc home owned by a washington insider connected to powerful lobbyists and it gets even worse stay tuned for more
2343899 wtf how is that possible since i am toned up and dropped a size
2343900 chicken liver bake enjoy it with the ashes of a loved one or maybe whats left of the chickens are in that urn maybe the chickens were your loved ones but chickens never love back enough and thats why you have to kill them and eat their livers ritualistically and then theyre a part of you forever forever

2343917 we are told that young people today inhabit their own peculiar culture which the church must endeavour to understand and not try to integrate with adult culture exactly how the children of baby boomers can have found a novel cultural space of yet further alienation and generational rebellion is left curiously unasked for the reality is that their more dissipated and listless mode of being alienated is but a result of earlier generational rebellion gone seriously awry which has left britain with an age divided society that has no parallel elsewhere not even in north america this state of affairs is quite manifestly evil and for the church to propose to underwrite it is little short of incredible
2343918 id say young would be defined as anyone whos not still living in the sixteenth century
2343919 its been a huge honor to get back with my good friends the real triumph of this tour is that we havent strangled each other that doesnt mean it hadnt crossed my mind
2343920 im confident eh rankings dont mean anything im going in to pull out the big throw
2343921 im really lucky situations like that can sometimes be really difficult and make it hard for you to carry on with the sport
2343922 yeah i guess it does the last olympics was won by 86m the latvian guy who came second threw a pb of 84m and got silver medal if i have a good day anything could happen
2343923 if you get the right combination of movement and launch angle then a big throw can come out of nowhere a lot of competitions are won like that you think where did that come from
2343924 definitely the speed of release is important but you have to have the optimal angle you just have to get all the combinations right you can come in fast an be quite explosive but if the javelins pointing too straight up it wont go far
2343925 its like a rubber band you get speed in your legs to put tension in the body to release through your arms its a full body movement
2343926 theres quite a few types of jav but they have to meet a set criteria i use a brand called nemis other people use other javs its a personal preference
2343927 and id rather use a new one the old ones are probably a bit dented and scratched which can effect the flight and the grips frayed so its a bit easier to use a newer one

2343931 heavyweight players who make an endearing fusion the flecktones have a fine time roaming all over the musical map its hard to resist a band that draws on bluegrass funk world music pop and jazz with such glee and blissful lack of pretension
2343932 when the flecktones first got together we worked out a christmas medley it was really fun people loved it and we continued to play it every year
2343933 i would argue there is a need for higher superannuation contributions
2343934 as a general comment i would agree that low middle earners would need a higher level of superannuation contribution above the 9 per cent
2343935 in terms of equity it is unfair that lower income earners are effectively taxed on a higher rate on their super contributions than their marginal income
2343936 but one of our election commitments was we will not be increasing the 9 per cent super guarantee which is payable by the employer we have ruled it out and we will be sticking to that
2343937 the majority of people who are currently retired and those in their early to mid 50s have very little super savings so even if you adopted the keating model tomorrow it doesnt help them in any significant way
2343938 the contributions tax is 15per cent so if you are a low income earner you are paying no income tax however you are paying a 15 per cent contributions tax clearly for low income earners super is not a tax advantage whereas if you are higher income earner super is
2343939 our position is 12 per cent is probably enough our modelling has been done on giving people a 52 per cent replacement income when you retire
2343940 my biggest fear was being attacked by somebody who did not want me on the boat i was 160km out to sea with no back up

2343945 a few weeks or so ago while i was staying at meson de las flores an almost wild looking dog was walking up the sidewalk and looked very bony and had very little spirit in his eyes i quickly got some dog food and tried to get him to come to me but he kept a distance of about ten or twelve feet realizing he was not going to come close enough to pet him i dropped a good portion of dog food for him to eat and stepped back far enough that he ate the food quickly and was wanting more after giving him a second helping he ran off and i did not see him for a couple of days anyways after a week or so of feeding him off and on he let me pet him and that is when i saw that 65 to 70 of his hair was missing i had told my wife about him and as she was in the us she said she was hoping he would be there when she returned to see and help him shortly after her return he showed up and she was taken back by his appearance but by this time he and i were good friends and she saw how affectionate he was and wanted to help him as chance would have it a local vet across the street had come over and said he needed a shot to get rid of certain parasites that were depleting him of nutrition and hair after finding out it would only cost 2 50 for the injection we went to his office and i held him while the vet gave him the shot the next day he showed up and i bent down to pet him but after a while i stood up and he grabbed at my hand to play he was getting better in just 24 hours today we saw him and fed him as we talked to him and petted him and he has hair filling back in already he is such an affectionate dog for having gone through the hardships he has and will or would make a great pet for someone it may even be us it is amazing what a little food and a little medication can do to help the less fortunate animals running the streets
2343946 im taking a dump in your garden looking at you through the window and theres nothing you can do about it

2343994 in many respects the soa market has lost its vision around what soa is actually trying to do not provide a new set of technology but provide a transformation focused on a design point called a business service a business service drives measureable business outcome
2343995 how we map business capabilities in a consumer provider fashion and map that into it systems and technologies a business person should be able to consume and provide capabilities without knowledge of the underlying technology and platforms and do that in a changeable manner
2343996 my opinion has been all business software development is about the business
2343997 as any experienced it staffer whos been on the sharp end of a big business merger or acquisition or even a radical change of leadership will tell you businesses dont act like machines that eas can simply steer so that they tend towards technology optimisation in fact its the opposite business change forces new competitors new product launches new market launches new regulations mergers and acquisitions and so on will always drive entropy tending to push it estates towards chaos the best value an ea team can really provide in this environment is to help the it organisation to absorb these changes with as little stress as possible and drive consistent planned responses
2343998 seeing my words in richards post combined with a completely unrelated discussion with hub vandervoort on standards organizations reference implementations and open source communities got me wondering what are most enterprise architecture groups responsible for delivering
2343999 how do we organize ourselves as people so that we can in fact form cooperative arrangements

2344001 what are the human dimensions to get people to interoperate together when there is no hierarchy stemming over those people

2344007 question 1 am i really concerned for the welfare of the lords servants
2344008 questions 2 do i regard my christian stewardship particularly although not exclusively of money as a partnership or do i see it only as an investment with no return a one way relationship i give they get
2344009 question 3 do i really believe that god will supply what i need if i give sacrificially or do i always give in such a way that sacrifice will be avoided do i see that generous giving is not the same thing as sacrificial giving i can give generously yet not sacrificially
2344010 question 4 do i really want to live and give pray and share with others in such a way that glory will be seen to come to our god and father by the way his people i love each other ii support each others ministries and iii depend on the lords provision so that it becomes clear that the power and the glory are his and not ours

2344022 studies are showing that the addition of fluoride to municipal water supplies is having little effect on oral health
2344023 health canada supports water fluoridation as a public health measure to prevent dental decay
2344024 the big advantage of water fluoridation is that it benefits all residents in a community regardless of age socioeconomic status education or employment
2344025 the result is that concession card holders rely on episodic relief of pain instead of having checks
2344026 this is a call for more funding to shorten waiting lists for public dental care and employ more dentists who are the only practitioners trained to provide the complex treatment that adults need
2344027 weight of evidence does not support a link between exposure to fluoride and increased risks of cancer

2344034 theyve brought together six top experts who have carefully looked at all of the details and they have come to a very clear result that there is not a link that would suggest fluoride is going to cause the problems that some people would suggest
2344035 the fluoride gets incorporated into the enamel of the tooth at the time that the tooth is forming so this makes a stronger coating on the tooth which is more resistant to decay right from the very start

2344344 the magnitude of the decline in truck and suv sales can be captured in two key events likely to unfold this year the toyota camry ending the ford f series 26 year run as the best selling vehicle line and honda vaulting past truck dependent chrysler to become the number three automaker by annual u s sales
2344345 the decline in industry volumes and the shift to more fuel efficient vehicles is creating a massive ripple effect in the supply chain
2344346 the full impact of very low truck and suv production in the second half of the year and any new production cutbacks this fall something we believe is likely will only make supplier cash flow problems more difficult to manage

2344403 and now after eight years of emptiness and waiting a beautiful 30 000 mausoleum in the allegheny cemetery will claim its own
2344404 it was only by accident that phils idea of having a nice and neat resting place for his body was discovered in the fall about eight years ago john staley and some other friends of the plunger crossing the cemetery came on smith superintending a party of men at work on a mausoleum
2344405 dont you see grunted phil nodding toward the beautiful structure of marble which was beginning to take definite shape
2344406 got to some time said the famous plunger as he sat down on a block of marble and discussed the hereafter
2344407 and since it was completed phil has not missed a year in which he did not visit it and see that the sexton had kept it well fixed up the sexton was his pensioner and was paid more than well for attending to the mausoleum against the time that phil should be carried into it

2344421 the new system is not meant to discourage students going to study in the uk but to weed out bogus colleges and students
2344422 the new system is probably going to help increase the number of students going to the uk and if it doesnt it would mean that bogus students have stopped applying besides some students used to drag their degrees in order to extend their stay in the uk but now they would have to complete it on time
2344423 often students accept offers from several universities use one for their visa application but on arriving in the uk end up going to a different university as a result the university is left with vacant seats and the government is left unaware of the students location however under the new rules the students passport will specifically mention which university the student is going to and they cannot change universities
2344424 students would also need to provide their fingerprints for biometric visas and ids

2344473 the ipr professional is one who is trained in the management and exploitation of intellectual property in most cases the person is professionally qualified and holds an ipr diploma essentially he would file for protection and registration of a clients patent copyright and trademark
2344474 on an average there has been a 60 per cent rise in ip filings in the past four to five years this is a sure indication of the kind of demand that exists for ip and patent professionals to meet the increasing demand of the companies more and more ipr professionals are required

2344485 unlike the americans we took our helmets and sunglasses off and looked at the iraqis eye to eye
2344486 the americans put on more and more armour and firepower the british go light and go on the ground
2344487 my view and the view of the british chain of command is that the americans use of violence is not proportionate and is over responsive to the threat they are facing
2344488 the us troops view things in very simplistic terms it seems hard for them to reconcile subtleties between who supports what and who doesnt in iraq its easier for their soldiers to group all iraqis as the bad guys as far as they are concerned iraq is bandit country and everybody is out to kill them
2344489 the british response in iraq has been much softer during and after the war the british set about trying to win the confidence of the local population there have been problems it hasnt been easy but on the whole it was succeeding
2344490 the us will have to abandon the sledgehammer to crack a nut approach it has failed
2344491 they need to stop viewing every iraqi every arab as the enemy and attempt to win the hearts and minds of the people
2344492 our objective is to create a stable democratic and safe iraq thats achievable but not in the short term it is going to take up to 10 years
2344493 take a cue from the way their british counterparts have taken control of basra
2344494 the main lesson that the americans can learn from basra and apply to baghdad is to use the softly softly approach
2344495 armies reflect their societies for better or for worse in britain guns are frowned upon and british troops faced with demonstrations in northern ireland must go through five or six stages including a verbal warning as the situation gets progressively more nasty before they are allowed to shoot in america guns are second nature
2344496 we are trained for every inevitability and we do this better than the americans
2344497 has got to be always conditioned by the fact that we withdraw when the job is done
2344498 i could have stayed on there for another six months we would have been able to defend ourselves and killed a lot of people in the process but what would that have achieved
2344499 u s and iraqi forces are involved in a huge operation to attack an al qaeda stronghold in mosul
2344500 but after that the plan is to turn the coalitions attention on to basra and we will be urging the british to surge into the city
2344501 if they do not have enough troops then they will be offered u s marines to help out
2344502 the feeling is that if southern iraq is hugely unstable it will affect the success of the surge in the north and destabilize the whole country
2344503 the proposal to go back into basra is being examined at the highest level in baghdad
2344504 we do not have enough troops for a surge ourselves the hope is that we can train enough iraqi army recruits in the next year to cope with the inter tribal warfare going on in basra
2344505 retain the ability to re intervene on the ground in the unlikely event of such a request from the iraqis
2344506 we have regular discussions with our coalition partners and the iraqi government and they support our approach
2344507 a coalition aircraft conducted an air strike on a group of gunmen who were firing rocket propelled grenades on iraqi security forces in basras western neighborhood of haiyyania at about 1 30 a m 2230 gmt on tuesday

2344510 belmont park was silent the rain beat down on dark secrets back as he hobbled in the mud the rain dripped from his coat but he was up he was up straight looking up the track and his head was high as high as a proud thoroughbred can hold it he had won the race
2344511 the joy of turf devotees over the get of a crack thoroughbred doing so well was stalled a few moments later when the wheatley stables illegible dark secret broke his leg a stride after he crossed the line a victor in the jockey club gold cup race for a second straight year there was a gasp from the thousands watching as the famous son of flying ebony sprawled a split second after the finish he steadied himself on three legs and then pulled up his right foreleg dangling at the fetlock
2344512 the got a van onto the track and a groom helped dark secret limp into it

2344514 all right mr fitz said the others nodded too there was nothing to talk about the horse had run himself to death
2344515 the vet reached into his bag for a needle with which he would inject poison into dark secrets blood stream
2344516 me and him we just walked away mr fitz says i wasnt going to look at that in the newspapers the next day dark secret got a couple of paragraphs at the tail end of the stories about the futurity which was a very important race because there was a lot of money in it for the winner dark secrets victory was only worth 6500 and that didnt make him very important at all

2344565 we used to live up on the hill and so every single day of my life id look down here and i could envision a vineyard
2344566 i could just see it so for me it was just the thing to do
2344567 it was one of the recommended ones for this particular site there were two or three others

2344573 for example with 07 were trying to achieve a fruitier wine

2344591 this energy is the beginning and the final synthesis the source of all energies
2344592 okay i have all this knowledge all this training all this preparation now what am i supposed to do with it
2344593 activity and intelligence work out from this source a result of purpose and wisdom it is the energy of full and great manipulations creativity and adaptability needs are recognized through this force plans are formulated material is selected and business is undertaken the third ray is clear inherent mental and intellectual ideation in pursuit of truth with the objective of manifesting in matter and substance it is the power which evokes form
2344594 this energy stands symbolically in the center of the seven and is the magnetic relation of opposites the point of harmony bridging and mediation amidst conflict pain and struggle in a sense the fruition of the duality rooted in the second ray it stimulates creativity art and beauty and is characterized by sensitivity to color and sound discrimination quickness and a searching for perfection reside here the intuitive relational force is strong in this ray which evokes life love and understanding
2344595 this is the energy of concretion into substance of knowledge and science and of stimulation in the three worlds it leads to the searching analysis and development of ideas which in the end produces light and wisdom it is the energy of differentiation and investigation which can lead to separativeness cleavage and crystallization but the thoroughness and discrimination with which the fifth force works in the mind and the intellect leads the way ultimately to understanding and to the revelation of truth
2344596 the seeds of all devotion and desire pour forth through this energy it generates adherence intensity and persistence the determination resident in this ray is a fiery essence sometimes full of force fury and even fanatical display and militant violence abstraction and aspiration characterize the sixth force in the sense of an idealistic nature loyally oriented toward the causal levels of being the sixth ray is the power to recognize what is right and righteous the upward tendency and the capacity to see the light
2344597 this last of the seven is the most tangibly expressive on the outer planes it is the quality of relationship between spirit and matter and is thus magical it is rhythm which builds integrates circulates and manifests it is the bringer and producer of newness in form the relational power of this ray motivates law and order rule and ritual organization and group consciousness it is practical understanding and vital energy externalized which embodies both center and the periphery consciousness
2344598 there are too many examples of celebrities who get famous and then disappoint us with their failings theyre only human so as adults were not surprised but girls feel let down
2344599 what i did have was a passion for what i was doing helping girls by creating a forum to connect them to each other and show them that they are not alone
2344600 a magazine starring regular girls not celebrities or even models on the cover was a new concept and one that publishing experts had a hard time getting behind
2344601 just like anything new and unproven my ideas were met with a lot of skepticism they simply didnt believe ordinary girls could sell on newsstands
2344602 it was a relief to know that there were other girls out there exactly like me
2344603 i loved how discovery girls answered the questions that i was too afraid to ask or that older people in my life thought to be stupid or childish

2344606 concerned residents objected to the special meeting fees because the meetings were really to discuss valleys proposal and our proposal was barely mentioned
2344607 if a citizen unrelated to concerned residents said they opposed valleys proposal the bill was getting charged to our escrow account
2344608 this was perhaps the ultimate proof that the triple crown must be approached with the utmost respect
2344609 trainer dutrow eats crow after big brown busts at belmont
2344610 race track patrons will never see their idol on the track again for the rest of his days colin will live in peace and quiet of the keene stock farm
2344611 the veteran sportsman was seen by an evening world reporter today at his rooms in the waldorf astoria he was deeply affected over the condition of colin
2344612 it is a blue day for me he said sadly i hoped perhaps with the attention of rowe and a rest colin would recover but a message to me this morning states that he is completely broken down and i have already begun to make arrangements to send him to my farm in kentucky
2344613 of course i am bitterly disappointed i was greatly attached to colin who is very intelligent and playful i expected great things from him this year
2344614 i am going down to see him this afternoon and i dread the trip
2344615 at the time of his breakdown colin was the greatest race horse in america he could beat every horse he ever met without extending himself most of his races were more gallops for him
2344616 it is a peculiar coincidence that sysonsby died after winning thirteen races and colin broke down after establishing the same record the hoodoo number has twice interfered in two years with james r keene champions
2344617 as between colin and sysonsby the former stands out as the greater race horse
2344618 only a few days ago mr keene said he believed colin would win every race in which he started
2344619 mr keene feels the breaking down of colin more deeply than he felt the death of sysonsby this is because he bred colin himself while sysonsby was bought the old sportsman entertains toward colin a feeling of affection akin to that felt by father for a child
2344620 with colin it was different mr keene watched his baby antics when he ran by the side of his dam over the pastures of blue grass he vistied him every day when he was finally shipped to the race track and placed in training for a career as a race horse the growth and development of colin have been watched by the eyes of a loving master
2344621 it is hard to tell just how badly colin is injured mr rowe is extremely secretive about the condition of the horse and refuses to allow any one outside the stable attendants to see him
2344622 dr sheppard the veterinarian who attended sysonsby has not yet been called to look at colin some of the trainers say they saw colin eating grass in an inclosure behind the keene stables at 6 oclock this morning and that he did not appear to be very lame
2344623 while colin may be able to walk and crop grass he will never be able to stand the strain of a race again it is probable that he will be shipped to castleton farm within a few days
2344624 when the doleful news reached james r keene he was stunned for a few minutes and could hardly believe that his great colt would never be able to face the starter again he accepted the blow however in his usual quiet was and though only of seeing that the horse had every care
2344625 h de courcey forbes the manager of mr keenes racing stables was affected quite as much as mr keene and jimmy rowe he was authority for the statement at belmont park yesterday that colin would never race again both he and jimmy rowe could hardly restrain tears when their many friends hurried to the paddock to offer sympathy mr forbes explained that the trouble came like a bolt of lightning out of a clear sky as there never had been any indication of weakness on the contrary colin had been of the hardy wear and tear sort which seemed to preclude his breaking how under the constant care with which he worked and raced
2344626 this was the eighteenth and last day of racing at belmont park and it was not noticeable that anyone shed tears of sorrow over the track of english institutions with all the english customs of racing the wrong way around the track
2344627 it will actually be worth a dollar more to go to gravesend where one will be able to see races without the aid of powerful magnifying glasses
2344628 this being the last day some of the most interesting stakes were reserved for today
2344629 fourth race the belmont for three year olds 10 000 added mile and a quarter belmont course
2344630 they ran this way to the main stretch where wild mint stopped hot shot and brandy then set sail for tanya and they gradually closed ground on even terms hot shot then tired and blandy went on after tanya finally forcing her to a hot drive in the last sixteenth to win by a neck blandy was four lengths away in third place
2344631 the belmont stood out as the feature of the program chiefly on account of its great value the race was one worthy of the stakes the oldest turf fixture of the east for it brought about a hotly fought finish between tanya post favorite and blandy winner of the withers tanya which made about all the running living only just long enough to get home first by a short neck with all the others of the field of seven beaten off the only other filly that has won a belmont stakes being ruthless which captured the event on its first running at jerome park in 1867 tanya rated the champion of her age and sex last season was regarded with doubt by the betting general public when she was installed favorite as in her only earlier race this season she was beaten badly by pasadena and voladay but the horseman and the harry payne whitney stable had every confidence in the filly to take up her weight and go the mile and quarter course and she remained first choice though the betting odds of 2 to 1

2344633 the race was run over a sloppy track and in a driving rain and little could be seen of the horses in the run around the tortuous s shaped track over which this particular race alone is run
2344634 colins share of the rich prize was 20 765 which brings his total winnings up to 163 442
2344635 the coming back of colin was almost as unexpected and sensational as the announcement last thursday that he would never race again
2344636 mr keene decided to start colin after a long and careful examination yesterday morning when there was not the faintest sign of the trouble which had caused so much concern only two days before the horse had been carefully pointed for this particular race and insamuch as he appeared to be in perfect condition mr keene determined that as a test was necessary if colin was to be kept in training he might as well take a chance of breaking him down permanently in a race rather than in a hard workout while colin pulled up sound and cooled out well mr keene said that he would not be entirely satisfied until tomorrow that the great colt was all right

2344645 george e smith better known as pittsburg phil died yesterday at asheville
2344646 bookmakers who have been questioned agree that none of the big bettors of today and none of the students of the race tracks can be classed with the late pittsburg phil they give credit to phil for being the greatest player the ring has ever known
2344647 much money as he has won from them they delight in telling of his amazing plunges and of the tricks he played on them
2344648 wrought up by the ruling passion that has made his name a byword on every race course in this country the great plunger picked winners in phantom races as he lay delirious and near deaths door at the sanitarium at asheville
2344649 pittsburg phil was the coolest and most calculating man the american turf has ever known no man could ever discern from his facial expression or action whether he bet a cigar or a fortune on a race
2344650 sphinx like he would watch his favorites come down the stretch if he won there would be as little trace of animation on his stoic face as there would be signs of disappointment if he lost no one could read his mind his hopes or his fears
2344651 just before his death there was reaction in asheville as he lay upon his bed of fever he wildly called upon his horses in imaginary races pleaded with them cried to them and then fell back upon his pillow weakened by his frenzy shouting words of victory
2344652 men who have marveled at this once self possessed man recall how he lost 285 000 up to the last three days of the saratoga meeting in august 1902 two days before the meeting closed he won heavily on his own horse brunswick at 6 to 1 to show the next day he went through the betting ring and played belle of lexington and won enough to almost put him even that same afternoon he plunged heavily on charley ellisons skillful at the good odds of 20 to 1 and cleaned up money enough in the three days play to net him 290 000 even that winning affected his stone like face no more than if it had been so many cents
2344653 the dead plunger started his career in a saddlery shop in pittsburg by playing the horses in the poolrooms he soon began attending the races and gradually worked himself up to a notch where he was looked upon as one of the wisest men on the turf
2344654 several years later he branched out as an owner and had in his employ the
2344655 he leaves a mother and a sister pittsburg phil was a visitor at ascot last year

2344703 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

2344751 in the 1880s several states responded to complaints about rigged races by banning bookmaking the boom years of the 1860s and 1870s had brought a glut of racetracks and in the 1890s tracks began to close while several states banned racing itself by 1908 the number of tracks in the united states had fallen to 25 from 314 a scant 11 years earlier new york which outlawed betting but not racing in 1908 effectively hobbled the industry by 1911 there was no racing at all in the state
2344752 did the law prohibit casual bets among friends no it did not
2344753 betting on horses then and now following the sport in new york is difficult and the odds are shorter than in old days but the system is little change advantages of pari mutuel method
2344754 betting in horse races is forbidden in kentucky and maryland one may back ones choice by the pari mutuel route but not so in any other state elsewhere the sport of kings and the king of sports has been legislated out of existence
2344755 that is to say it has been legislated theoretically out of existence actually it has only been handicapped to use a racecourse term actually the only consequence of prohibitive laws has been much the same as the prohibitive law against beer it has resulted in a poorer product
2344756 betting at jamaica when the races were in progress there and at the empire city track later has not been so different in methods from the days of twenty five years ago in new york when betting was in its heyday presumably it will be so at saratoga the chief difference is that the bettor makes his own slip the bookmaker declining to take the chance of recording a wager further the present system requires a sublime credulity and an implicit faith in human nature
2344757 in the old days the bettor did not make the slip but neither did he receive any record of the wager the bookmaker who sat on a high stool and held a slate on which were written the names of all the entries and the odds he offered against them for each position entered in ink on a pad in front of him the badge number of the bettor the amount of the wager and the odds
2344758 let us suppose that a man nowadays a man not identified with racing nor a follower of the ponies and therefore not acquainted with the sub rosa bookmakers hereabouts fares forth to one of the tracks around new york with the intention of backing his judgment or his luck in the betting shed he sees groups of men standing about the posts they look like idlers they have no slates no pads none of the paraphernalia of gambling but if he approaches one of these men and offers to confide in his care a bank roll of 50 or 100 more or less it will be accepted with alacrity the stranger has opened an account he is now in a way to bet all or any part provided it is 2 or more on the horse of his choice in return for his money he received some blank slips of paper
2344759 no bets will be accepted in the betting shed the law is specific and extremely verbose about accepting wagers in a stated place and the bookies interpret that literally to mean under cover anywhere the bet must be placed in the open
2344760 when accepting the bank roll the bookmaker indicates a spot where he or one of the men idling with him can be found later just before the race begins the stranger finds one or more of the group at the appointed spot and himself writes a slip which he confides to the layer of odds
2344761 if the bet is large enough to be of consequence if the bettor wins and is a stranger he must wait in most cases until the next day to collect he must then journey again to the track find the man to whom he gave his slip and ask for his money as a rule this patience and perseverance is rewarded he collects
2344762 but the consequence of this underhanded method of playing the races is that the man who plays gets much worse odds
2344763 the reason is not altogether to the bookmakers discredit in an elder day when the whole field of starters was chalked on a slate or blackboard and the bettor could see the odds against all the horses the chances were that all the entries would get a play nowadays when the word goes through the paddock or the lawn that certain horses are being backed practically all the betting concentrates on them in a race with a dozen starters for instance not more than half a dozen will receive any play only half will be backed to win or get the place or show and the consequence is that the restriction of the field so far as the wagers are concerned make for a restriction of betting odds
2344764 loud have been the wails of players about the stinginess if the layers at racetracks around the new york comparison has been made to the extremes disadvantage with the generosity of the odds paid by the pari mutuels at latonia and churchill downs but an examination of the conditions brings forth some excuse for the bookmaker here
2344765 the volume of betting is greatly decreased by the circumstances here and this is another reason for less favorable odds
2344766 in town the precautions are even more rigorous for of course you can lay a bet on the races in town provided you havent the opportunity to go out to the track in town you must have a face to face acquaintance with the bookmaker or must have an introduction from a sterling man to man acquaintance the books are of two kinds a few are said to be bold enough to maintain poolrooms with direct wires telephone wires for the most part because the telegraph companies have suffered too severely at the hands of the law to relish these contracts over which the results of the races are flashed to a questioning and impatient clientele getting into the poolrooms is extremely difficult
2344767 most of the books in new york are handbooks let us consider the operation of an imaginary example the layer of odds is in touch with employees in certain office buildings janitors they may be or elevator boys or messengers and for a percentage of the sums bet these men take custody of the amounts wagered by the men in that building and turn them over to the bookmaker with slips showing who placed the money and what horse is to carry it
2344768 the players in this case know nothing of what odds are to be offered against the horses they choose as a rule the bookmakers accept as authentic the betting odds published the following morning in a newspaper which devotes especial attention to sports but some of them have arbitrary rules limiting the odds they will lay such as 20 to 1 there was the case not long since of three men who had united in a group to play the races daily for small sums among the acquaintances of these men it was known as the pikers pool there came a day when but 3 remained in the bank one dollar was bet on gleinpner and was lost another was placed on mountain rose and mountain rose also lost the last dollar in the pikers pool was placed on crepuscule and crepuscule won at 30 to 1
2344769 but even while the three pikers were congratulating themselves there came a sad disillusion the handbook maker would pay but 20 to 1 it was house rules the layer of odds was adamant the three pikers were compelled to accept the piker return on bet
2344770 these handbook makers do not depend solely upon their touts and compradors in office buildings at certain hours they may be found at certain places in barrooms for barrooms are still open despite the law just as betting is still maintained despite law or in office building foyers or in hotel lobbies their clients know where the bookmakers can be found and place their money personally with verbal instructions in such cases the betting is actually oral and after the races are done the bookmaker posts himself at a certain spot and pays off such of the players as have won and are known to him personally but as a rule he distributes the next morning among his office building touts plain manila envelopes containing the money intended for those whose judgment or luck has prevailed against gargantuan chance
2344771 how different the pari mutuel system pari mutuel betting is legalized and has the merit of eliminating the bookmaker who has long been recognized as the chief evil of the racetrack just as the saloonkeeper has long been recognized as the chief evil of the liquor traffic it has been said that this country had no drink problem only a saloon problem in the same way it may be said that the racetracks have no gambling problem only a bookie problem
2344772 the pari mutuel system is the joy of the race fan it pays by far the best odds and manipulation is eliminated there is no bookmaker to demand the lions share of the money however the race may go all the money paid in except for the racing associations expenses goes to the winners it is the system in effect at churchill downs and latonia in kentucky at pimlico and havre de grace in maryland
2344773 but everybody concedes that betting on the races in new york nowadays has more punch to it then 2 75 beer

2344893 dr fager sets world record mark colts time 1 32 1 5
2344894 burdened with 134 pounds in the 112 700 washington park handicap dr fager established himself as carrier of the year by setting a world record of 1 minute 32 1 5 seconds for the mile a crowd of 27 861 cut loose with a chorus of yah hoos as the 4 year old tartan stable colt sped under the wire 10 lengths ahead of racing room
2344895 john nerud trainer and part owner of dr fager with william l mcknight called the colts efforts another babe ruth performance gaining his 16th victory in 20 starts dr fager earned 67 700 more than enough to pay the latest installment on his 1 million insurance policy commenting on the size of the policy nerud said it was not very much considering dr fagers potential as a sire nerud may be right the colt will begin his breeding career next winter in florida
2344896 nerud had doubted dr fager would break buckpassers record buckpasser came from off a fantastic early pace set by his stablemate impressive who ran the first six furlongs that day in 1 06 4 5 dr fager nerud figured would be setting his own pace by the time the field reached the six furlong mark with nothing to challenge him in the stretch he supposedly would not get the pressure needed to break buckpassers record
2344897 but dr fager a colt with rare desire and dash roared through the upper stretch after taking the lead after six furlongs with the fractional time of 1 07 3 5 a slight following wind may have helped the contestants in their long run down the backstretch but worked the other way in the stretch and thats where dr fager slammed though to his record
2344898 baeza who arrived here by plane from new york about noon said he had tapped dr

2344973 any number of alcoholics are bedeviled by the dire conviction that if they ever go near aa they will be pressured to conform to some brand of faith or theology
2344974 for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine
2344975 we suggest that you find a substitute for this destructive power alcohol and turn to a higher power regardless of the name by which you may identify that power we suggest that you turn your will and your life over to god as you understand him

2345079 it is our long standing policy to present research findings to those who have participated in our studies in advance of the data being made public
2345080 now poling and healy are standard bearers for the poorly conceived hypothesis that children receive too many vaccines too early as a consequence some parents are choosing to delay withhold or separate vaccines
2345081 the public airing of that hypothesis caused thousands of parents to avoid the mmr many children were hospitalized and several died from measles as a result
2345082 to take another look at that hypothesis not deny it
2345083 a susceptible group does not mean that vaccines arent good
2345084 it is the job of the public health community and of physicians to be out there and to say yes we can make it safer because we are able to say this is a subset were going to deliver it in a way we think is safer
2345085 major studies that focus on 300 kids who got autistic symptoms within a period of a few weeks of getting a vaccine
2345086 i really take issue with that conclusion the reason they didnt want to look for those susceptibility groups was because if they found them that would scare the public away
2345087 populations do not test causality they test associations you have to go into the laboratory
2345088 the fact that there is concern that you dont want to know that susceptible group is a real disappointment to me
2345089 fueled by an illegal marketing campaign designed to promote the powerful drug for unapproved uses for children for seniors with dementia and for sleeping disorders to name a few
2345090 patients like wanda bernal of claymont who has taken seroquel for two years for her sleeping disorder said she was diagnosed six months ago with diabetes a disease linked to antipsychotic drugs

2345092 we do believe its critical for people with mental illness to get the treatment they need
2345093 because if i do i wont be able to sleep at all
2345094 theres something very unique about this compound that has been proven through clinical studies to work across a wide range of mental illnesses
2345095 you had 10 to 15 years of marketing in which the companies controlled the journal publications controlled the speakers bureaus controlled the dinners controlled the patient advocacy groups all of which communicated these drugs were a breakthrough
2345096 from the outset defendants recognized the need to promote nonmedically accepted indications and nonmedically necessary uses as the key to blockbuster success for their respective antipsychotic drugs
2345097 astrazeneca strenuously denies the allegations in these lawsuits most of which have been brought by private personal injury lawyers and will defend itself in these lawsuits
2345098 fda and the courts have recognized that off label prescribing by doctors is not only lawful but may be essential to giving patients optimal medical care
2345099 the decision to treat a patient using a medicine outside the scope of the labeling is a medical judgment made by the physician
2345100 we can acknowledge that we are part of a multistate investigation of the drug
2345101 astrazeneca intends to litigate these cases on the merits and will defend the cases vigorously
2345102 a large part of the legal problems attributed to zyprexa if they exist are arguably due to the failure of the responsible federal agencies to prevent abuse
2345103 because of my particular experience with my illness it was absolutely a miracle drug and ive been on it ever since
2345104 ive never been this big and ive had four kids
2345105 that particular use of it i dont think was marketed heavily as an off label indication by the company

2345109 if we tell them 250 grams of nescafe is on the list they will drop the price so they look better but then raise the cost of something else
2345110 you can see that in 52 of 61 regions coles is cheaper and that the independent outlets are uncompetitive across most of the regions

2345117 while fire calls have increased fractionally the number of fires within residential premises fell fires involving household contents and unattended cooking fell by 23 per cent and 3 per cent respectively

2345269 addressing the challenge of sustainable production and consumption by seeking out innovative thinkers and experts from business government academic and ngo communities to chart a new relationship between government and business in the service of achieving sustainable life styles
2345270 the dialogue builds on a core of shared values that government has a duty to protect public assets variously called the commons and public trust that government is needed to define and enforce performance standards in the public interest but then government should give industry the freedom to do what industry does best innovate to achieve the desired outcomes
2345271 our mission is to develop and communicate a strong framework for product focused environmental policies that advance sustainable production and consumption and good governance
2345272 our strategy is to connect innovative thinkers and diverse stakeholders to develop a big picture framework for sustainable production and consumption for a north american audience to provide problem centered input and solutions to high impact problems in the arena of product production consumption and disposal and to communicate policy solutions effectively
2345273 in my time we were on the outside throwing stones then some of us joined government so we could directly access power and make regulatory changes gary was a policy advisor to former ontario environment minister jim bradley who introduced far reaching environmental legislation during his term of office but now whats needed is young people to go into the corporate world and change companies from within

2345276 some of our customers also responded to the recent earthquake in china and will be needing new equipment because they generally leave their equipment behind for the host country to continue to use
2345277 most of our sales go to agencies and organizations that buy in advance because they never know when a disaster will strike
2345278 plus we could never afford to keep enough inventory in stock to adequately respond to a disasters immediate demand
2345279 mom how about i tackle reorganizing the linen closet today
2345280 youve done enough today take the rest of the day off
2345281 it will continue to grow but it will be very sluggish in the 1 to 2 range until at least the end of the year and probably through 2009 as well
2345282 we believe we will continue to see capacity depart creating a better pricing environment
2345283 sixty one percent of our respondents indicated they were either seeing base rates increase or getting better fuel surcharge recovery we believe shippers will be aligning themselves with large trucking companies to ensure capacity when the north american economy begins to reaccelerate which we view as a 2009 event at best
2345284 the recent theme in trucking markets seems to be performance beating very low expectations at least for the big publicly traded carriers
2345285 this seems to be more of a capacity story than a demand story
2345286 truckers will be burdened for the balance of 2008 by the same uncertainty plaguing intermodal markets
2345287 in fact their challenges appear even larger given the outsized impact of fuel on trucking costs with costs high and demand weak trucking executives will struggle to find their way to recovery for an increasing number intermodal will become an attractive alternative
2345288 there has been a shift to intermodal by some shippers due to fuel prices but that is only going to affect goods shipped 800 to 1000 miles or more its much more difficult to switch to intermodal for distances of 300 or 400 miles
2345289 thats before you look at vehicle miles traveled which includes passenger cars
2345290 so that really leaves us with only two choices either we have more trucks on the road or bigger trucks on the road because the math is just not working out
2345291 however high fuel costs are squeezing their profit margins down to nothing shipments for some carriers ive talked to are up 10 to 15 but with truckings average profit margin around 3 6 that gets eaten up by high diesel costs if fuel goes up just 5 in a week as it has done this year they suddenly have no margin at all

2345303 i would play only 20 percent of friendly internationals within the concacaf region
2345304 its very important that we establish a broad base of talent we only have 30 or so players who can compete at an international level we need 60 70 80 players at a minimum who have quality international experience
2345305 one year on what began as a us crisis is fast becoming a world crisis small wonder only a handful of global equity markets are in positive territory relative to august 2007 while more than half have declined by between 10 and 40 per cent the us slowdown will also affect many emerging markets less reliant on exports than china at the same time the global slowdown is about to kick away the last prop keeping the us recession at bay but as in the 1930s the critical phase is not the us phase it is when the crisis goes global that the term credit crunch will no longer suffice
2345306 it is evil to take lives and noble to save them each day i pledge to save a hundred lives i drop my net in the lake and scoop out a hundred fishes i place the fishes on the bank where they flop and twirl dont be scared i tell those fishes i am saving you from drowning soon enough the fishes grow calm and lie still yet sad to say i am always too late the fishes expire and because it is evil to waste anything i take those dead fishes to market and i sell them for a good price with the money i receive i buy more nets so i can save more fishes
2345307 the next coach needs to go about his business especially in the next two years prior to qualifying where results are less important than exposing players to the international level but thats going to be very difficult because this is a results oriented society with commitment to sponsors and their desire to having a winning product

2345324 its very difficult to see how we can prevent the oil from being used and the carbon getting in to the atmosphere because it comes from vehicles but in the case of coal if were going to use that we could restrict it to power plants and we should say it can only be used there if you capture the co2
2345325 i think its a better way than saying lets reduce co2 80 or 90 or 60 or any particular number because we really cant let 40 or 20 of the coal to continue to be used thats the one source that we really need to cut off
2345326 coal is the largest contributor to the human made increase of co2 in the air
2345327 saving the planet and creation surely requires phase out of coal use
2345328 if they dont change their tactics theyre guilty of crimes against humanity and nature
2345329 i would say within a decade or so that these coal plants are simply not compatible with keeping a planet resembling the one in which civilisation developed and i think there is going to be eventually pressure to in effect bulldoze those plants so economically they just dont make sense you are not going to be able to leave them there 50 years
2345330 restore the point of energy balance because as it stands now we will lose the arctic sea ice without any more greenhouse gases as there is additional warming in the pipeline that means we would have to reduce the amount of co2 at least to the 350ppm level and we are already at 385 so weve actually got to go backwards and its really too bad that we didnt realise this earlier
2345331 yes yes its still possible if we get on the stick very promptly its still practical to do that in ways that are quite natural the most important thing is to have a moratorium on new coal fired power plants that dont capture co2 and then to phase out the dirty coal use over the next 2 3 decades if we do that you know that the system does still take up co2 the ocean and the soils and things so that other things being equal co2 would only go up to a bit more than 400 if we phase out coal use but then we have got to take at least 50ppm out of the atmosphere and that is possible with improved agricultural and forestry practices things that we have not being paying much attention to

2345358 i do need to work on some things so when i go back home this summer thats what im going to do
2345359 when i get a puck in the zone i need to work on my shifty ness and being able to slow down the play he added
2345360 i think everything could use some work i dont think anything can be good enough
2345361 all the doubters people who said i couldnt do it i just want to prove to everyone that i can play at a higher level and that i can do the same things a six foot player can do

2345378 all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery
2345379 avoid the horror of death if you like but at root there is something anti human about that avoidance indifference lasts only until your mother actually dies although some remain adamant atheists when they face death the norm is that a sudden interest in the supernatural kicks in once we hear the news that our disease is terminal

2345384 for what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses or forfeits himself

2345386 when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints and to be marveled at among all who have believed because our testimony to you was believed
2345387 for because he himself has suffered when tempted he is able to help those who are being tempted

2345471 there is only one government that has used nuclear weapons against civilian populations and that same nation has the largest stockpile of weapons of mass destruction on the planet
2345472 iran has suffered greatly at the hands of the u s we recall the u s overthrew the democratically elected government of dr m mossadegh and returned the shah to the peacock throne the proudest achievement of the cia for 25 years the shah ruled iran with an iron fist for the benefit of u s oil corporations before the people of iran in the millions overthrew his tyranny at a terrible cost in lives for the past 27 years u s sanctions have impeded irans right to development and brought great suffering to the people

2345487 enough is enough in our name with our money they are killing people across the world we waged war in iraq more than a million innocent men women and children have died
2345488 peoples lives are in a crisis with the rising gas prices rising rents and food costs people are sick of war and want our tax money to be spent on the real needs of the people

2345491 noted journalist traveller and student of russian affairs who has spent several years touring the union of soviet russia
2345492 a polemic devoid of any documentation and lacking in any scholarship
2345493 american newspaperman like thomas walker wrote plainspoken and graphic accounts of the famine based on what they had witnessed in the ukraine in 1933 note the convenient backdating of walkers trip to 1933 and not 1934
2345494 rather than being a scholarly analysis the material consists of a highly emotionally charged vitriolic polemic indeed it has little to do with scholarship and unquestionably is lacking in objectivity
2345495 grand analytical generalisations have come from second hand bits of overheard corridor gossip
2345496 my friend met bukharins wife in a camp and she said
2345497 on political matters basically the best though not infallible source is rumour
2345498 again a year of drought coincided with chaotic agricultural conditions and during the winter of 1932 3 a great famine like that of 1921 2 swept across soviet ukraine
2345499 the attempt is too transparent and the hands are too unclean to succeed
2345500 mankind must first of all eat drink have shelter and clothing before it can pursue politics science art religion etc
2345501 the history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of class struggle
2345502 the superordination of the european categories corresponded to the superiority of the european artillery

2345504 a considerable distance from the turning point at which the historical course of society becomes one of descent

2345507 the dispute over the reality or non reality of thinking which is isolated from practice is a purely scholastic question

2345511 when i faced the braves in 92 bruce dal canton threw knuckleballs to the guys in batting practice
2345512 i felt great from the time i warmed up today that i had good movement and good command
2345513 i felt good last start too its a matter of continuing what ive been doing working hard and the results will eventually show up
2345514 when hes on his knuckleball is the nastiest pitch youve seen
2345515 whenever he goes deep in the game its good for them
2345516 obviously not or hed be pitching in the big leagues
2345517 the second inning on he had it going he mixed in a couple of fastballs at opportune times its a difficult thing when youre looking for that thing dancing and he drops a 72 mph fastball in
2345518 that was a key catch to get the two outs with a runner on second the homer wasnt bad either
2345519 i was running in i wasnt sure i could get to it i dove for the ball ill take a great catch any day but a three run homer to center ill take that too the home run was pretty neat
2345520 to finally find out the day before the olympics starts that youre not competing its just heartbreaking i wish he was here with me
2345521 he doesnt blame anybody he doesnt call anybody names hell get over this and get on to something else but he deserves this just as much as anyone on this team he deserves to be called an olympian hes a testament to the attitude the commitment everything that goes along with being an olympian
2345522 was to bring casey to the games and with drug positives or no shows hope the iwf would let him in that didnt happen unfortunately
2345523 were lifting weights clean and we have a slot taken away from us
2345524 that we play the game clean and get penalized for it thats what hurts the most
2345525 but its hard at this moment to say youll keep going i think he needs some time away from the sport right now
2345526 i dont see what the big deal is the earths atmosphere has had co2 levels this high in the past

2345538 season 4 of how i met your mother will have 26 episodes
2345539 kids let me tell you the story of how i met your father
2345540 how me and your mother dated had sex got married and had the two of you
2345541 and thats how i realized that she was going to be my wife
2345542 i want to know you ted hat makes you cry
2345543 later on that night i found out that your mother was there as well
2345544 fucking hell i cant believe something like that would happen
2345545 i dont want to say too much for fear of shaking the gift under the christmas tree ive played rhythm guitar tracks on every song and lots of lead solos added parts to future songs
2345546 i think its a grand idea when we first started rawk a couple of years ago the area was rife with anti social behaviour
2345547 im here because i enjoy football and i would like to make it big when i grow up
2345548 its not so much of a challenge to me voice work is a gift it was liberating in a great way working with george because like in aladdin he would let us just go and because its computerised its great to know that someone didnt draw for two years and go oh please just say the words so it was great to have that freedom and to watch george basically closing his eyes and going slower but george has a great sense of humour hes done road warrior and babe that gives you a certain breadth of character
2345549 maybe slightly with voice work but more with some of the mask work in other films mrs doubtfire was more that kind of thing even with all that make up and costume the idea of being fully cocooned or in bicentennial man where the face is almost like a statue thats where julliard comes out at its best i suppose with animated films you can be physical and in a cartoon you can create a character that doesnt look like you or sound like you you can build it from scratch youre manufacturing this brand new person
2345550 ive always been mixing serious and comic over the years it kind of started with world according to garp and the awakenings its the fact that i can that makes it all so wonderful and then all of a sudden they let me do something as dark as one hour photo or a cartoon like this its what i love doing
2345551 im fascinated by animals i watch all of the bbc series
2345552 once again we see the small male approach the female with hope in his eyes realising that the female will eat the male after the fact how many women would love to make love all night and then have their man turn into a pizza this is the way with the black widow spider lets watch
2345553 been doing it for years since the very first consoles
2345554 i mean its great playing online for eight hours straight and getting my ass kicked by a 10 year old again and again thats my idea of fun
2345555 its just amazing to see the quality in the games the quality and gameplay and the ai
2345556 youd have to be asleep not to get the point alright but its only about industrial fishing and its effect theres been a lot of publicity recently and scientific studies revealing that by the year 2048 i dont know how they get that specific that will fish out 98 per cent of the worlds fish thats kind of frightening considering the size and the nature of our oceans yeah i think its not bad to at least make people aware of that because first the penguins go and then at the end people will be going aww wheres the fish helen sorry sam were down to nothing one clam
2345557 im taking a break after this so ill be taking some time off and just be with my family you know

2345696 counties have been cutting the fat and the meat off those programs and in some cases cutting into the bone
2345697 if we see the pattern that weve identified continue the outcomes are likely to be harsher

2345725 we should have got a much higher score than what we got at the end of the day but this is part and parcel of test cricket it is a call for win sessions
2345726 and i think we are still very much in the game if we have one or two early wickets in the morning we can be right back into the game
2345727 it is a fantastic wicket to bat on to be very honest there was hardly anything for the bowlers there was nothing for the fast bowlers nothing for the spinners it is just that we did not bat well we should have got much more score than what we got
2345728 there was hardly any grass on the surface to be very honest he bowled very well he bowled in the right channel that is what is really important on this kind of a track where there is hardly any help for the fast bowlers he bowled in the right areas
2345729 it is good because at one stage we were 198 for 9 and from there having a 50 run last wicket partnership brought us right back into the game and especially after taking one wicket at the end they really got us back into the game
2345730 if you look at the amount of overs they have bowled in this entire series those two are going to take the maximum wickets
2345731 it is very difficult to answer this question because they are very quality players it is just that i am in very good nick and i am feeling good about myself feeling good about whatever is happening around my balance everything
2345732 that is what is working for me the important thing is to just go out there and keep doing these things again and again this is what test cricket and international cricket is all about

2345770 they had an great acid jazz night that brought together great players from the local to national scene who might not otherwise have the opportunity to play together
2345771 i thought the acid jazz experiments would be a great asset to the humboldt county music community
2345772 it brings out everyone from musicians to music connoisseurs to people who just want to get down with the funk
2345773 the idea was to gather all of the musicians in town
2345774 see who wants to play funk music and instead of doing an open mic thing i have a structured thing where theres usually two sets of players every night and they get a full 90 minute set so its really like having two bands that have never played together before
2345775 after the second or third jam during the acid jazz experiment you start to get to know the players
2345776 and after a while the music starts sounding really good
2345777 it always starts out with just a jam in a key
2345778 this particular night is made to forget what you know and get onstage and make people dance funky style
2345779 im extremely interested in seeing what people can do when they get outside of themselves
2345780 my view for this whole thing is that id like to see the next five or six good bands come out of this
2345781 id like to see some of these players get together and form bands so thats why its different from a blues night
2345782 its got its own style its got its own niche its got its own music scene its a total community that breathes its own life and theres tons of good music
2345783 of course they want to register as many firms as they can but maybe some of these firms arent ones youd want to have listed anyway
2345784 our research shows that over a third of people privatelyrenting are doing so because they cant get a mortgage at themoment
2345785 on the surface of it this looks like the rental marketshould be buoyant but if you consider that many of thoserenting may be struggling to make ends meet it is certainly notall good news for buy to let owners
2345786 the question to my mind is whether or not we ought to get them the heck out of that country because thats some crazy stuff when youve got your officials talking like they are in a back alley brawl and not government officials who took an oath to obey the law and so forth

2345933 he has really dominating stuff and he has a lot of room to get better hes going to be a lot of fun to watch one day
2345934 he was throwing the ball but now hes a pitcher hes not nervous any more and now its obvious that he can pitch at this level hes just a tough kid that doesnt like to lose
2345935 my first few starts i was scared and hitters were taking advantage of my mistakes
2345936 it felt like they knew what pitches i was going to throw now i know that i cant just rely on my fastball and i have to work hard to be successful

2345945 in the end they werent needed but theres a principle here we have the phoenix coached by the national coach not prepared to release players for the olympic games yet tony lochhead has gone off for a trial at middlesbrough
2345946 there would have been a huge furore if that had happened overseas if i was head of new zealand soccer i would have had massive reservations about my head coach of the national team not releasing his club players to go play at a tournament like the olympics
2345947 that just staggers me some of the things ive been hearing have been horrendous i think deep down 99 per cent of people involved in new zealand soccer think the same thing but people are a bit too politically correct to say so
2345948 the talents there that was obvious last night against china but all these guys are complete amateurs who do their jobs and go to university and theyre playing against ronaldinho and brazil on sunday

2345957 we dont know where he fits in right now but i do know that were going to be working him in as much as we can the rest of the season hes going to get plenty of innings
2345958 it feels great to know that this team is going to give me an opportunity to prove myself
2345959 i want to help this team win and were playing well right now so its good that i get to be a part of all of this i want to contribute as much as i can
2345960 its a special feeling the start of a new season
2345961 when i dont have that ill know its time to get out
2345962 there is no question the potential with our players is there
2345963 they have the ability to grow into a good football team we the coaches are going to have to be patient because you know young players are going to make mistakes one day theyll look great the next theyll look like theyve never played the game

2345968 i think this team might be a year away from being really really good
2345969 but i think were heading in the right direction and will be competitive this year

2345973 how could you sleep with barney thats so gross was it amazing did he have devices hot wax did he tie you to something is he all smooth down there
2345974 my moms coming into town next month you wanna try to nail her too
2345975 they still need to explain the 30 year old daughter in 2030
2345976 i don t think having a goat in the apartament i a good idea
2345977 robin wasn t living with me at my 30th birthday
2345978 oh okay ex girlfriend everything is fine a dandy no worries could you excuse me a second while i go castrate barney emotionally
2345979 oh yeah its over totally done this is the end yeah so over
2345980 hey robin guess who nailed a chick from metro news 1 last night
2345981 should the dry spells be of equal length a game of discreet roshambo shall determine the outcome
2345982 well jason it depends on how you play roshambo i always think of it as rock paper scissors but urban dictionary says otherwise 1 roshambo a game to kick each other in the balls over an object last one standing wins
2345983 what matters to me is how the court overall is perceived and how if it was not kwame kilpatrick sitting in that seat if it was john six pack sitting in that seat what would i do and that answer is simple
2345984 its not serious to him that hes a criminal defendant this court should be outraged
2345985 ive been living in an incredible state of pres sure and scrutiny
2345986 if we knew the answer to that wed be pretty wealthy men
2345987 the crux of it is that youve got 16 people ramming together quite fast and theres only a very small point on the shoulder that you can hit to get it right
2345988 i think there was a study done a few years ago about how much pressure there is upon impact and its something like two tonnes so if you dont get it right or somebodys out of alignment or theres a missed bind thats why it goes down
2345989 one of the problems weve got to is the education of referees around who is at fault there are times when a player is at fault but by and large they dont choose to pull them down
2345990 the old forwards get a bad rap when it comes to the brains point of view but it takes a lot to understand whats going on and even when you understand whats going on you cant get it right all the time
2345991 a referee only has to change his engagement call by half a second and it makes a difference its a difficult one and i understand why people get frustrated but a scrum is one of those things that spectators are really supportive of if its dominant
2345992 there is a bit of that but it goes back to your argument about spectators not liking it youre not going to please people all the time so its a really difficult argument
2345993 the whole idea of a scrum is to re start play and make it a contest to win a ball thats not yours just like in a lineout the whole idea of rugby is that its a battle and you dont want to get beaten so why take things away from guys that are part of a contest
2345994 schwarzenegger is right to look at the sales tax instead of raising income tax on the rich

2345996 roll back government and corporate encroachment on individual freedom by allowing information to flow past the barriers erected by totalitarian or authoritarian governments and around the gatekeepers of the mainstream media
2345997 just as a trusted computing system will load neither programs nor data files without a validated certificate whose signature matches their contents neither will the secure internet transfer any document in any standard protocol without such a certificate accompanying it
2345998 a documents certificate its imprimatur identifies the person individual or legal entity responsible for its publication provides a signature which permits verifying its contents have not been corrupted or subsequently modified and identifies the document registry which granted the imprimatur and which on demand will validate it and confirm that it has not been revoked
2345999 more than any innovation in the last century the internet empowers individuals to spontaneously teach learn explore communicate form communities and collaborate measured relatively this individual empowerment comes at the expense of the power of governments and large commercial enterprises thereby reversing a trend toward concentration of power more than a century old which has acted to reduce free citizens and productive individuals to mere subjects and consumers

2346016 mr tenet we dont have enough information to reach a conclusion we have to say we dont know
2346017 based on what we knew up to 98 we think theres no reason to believe that theyve iraq changed
2346018 it is well established that at my direction cia resisted efforts on the part of some in the administration to paint a picture of iraqi al qaida connections that went beyond the evidence the notion that i would suddenly reverse our stance and have created and planted false evidence that was contrary to our own beliefs is ridiculous
2346019 there are undoubtedly many other errors in the book but these are the first ones of which ive been made aware
2346020 i never received direction from george tenet or anyone else in my chain of command to fabricate a document from habbush as outlined in mr suskinds book

2346034 its an adversarial approach toward the citizens you are representing it certainly doesnt show good faith i think most voters would be shocked that our own elected officials these are people that serve at the pleasure of the citizens for the citizens are conducting themselves in a way that is in essence spying on representatives of the community

2346043 i dont think i said but i only wanted to say that if the others decide on it then
2346044 my opponent isnt interested in solving the problems facing eastern north carolina
2346045 instead he is spending all his time and money playing political games and trying to mislead voters about me it is obvious to me that he has no solutions to the problems regular people are facing thats why he is running a dirty campaign to try to distract attention from his poor record
2346046 many of the people they called hung up on them because they are sick and tired of all the negative politics
2346047 my message to the people of lenoir wayne and greene counties is simple if you are happy with politics as usual and dirty campaigning van braxton is doing fine

2346101 we continue to believe that democracy is the right way to go that elections routinely without coups are the right way to go
2346102 american policy and coups dont go along very well together so that has made it difficult but fiji is still filled with wonderful people and great deal of potential
2346103 and so washington and i just hope that things settle down rapidly and you can achieve those potentials in the future
2346104 the us has one way and the fiji constitution has another other countries have different ways many ways to get there but the key is to have the voice of the people heard so that the leadership is responsive to the people and has legitimacy from the people
2346105 an election under the current system will be fine by us to bring in a government with that kind of legitimacy and that they can address other issues that obviously need addressing in fiji
2346106 we are not fans of coups but we believe very strongly that the united states will continue to advocate for a return to truly democratic governance at the earliest possible time

2346166 my leadership skills were developed as project leader of large multi institutional projects funded by the wrc i have first hand knowledge of the effectiveness of the system and would like to see it continue into the future as capacity building is sorely needed in our country that faces many water related challenges
2346167 i would like to provide effective leadership to the board to ensure that the wrc succeeds in discharging its mandate of leading and co ordinating water related research
2346168 i led the team that developed the methods for determining the ecological reserve for estuaries south africa has some of the best water legislation in the world but the ongoing challenge is to translate policy into action and to bridge the gaps between science and management
2346169 through research the wrc can ensure that there is capacity to implement policy and legislation

2346177 since sony began its sponsorship of tropfest in november 2003 the film festival has gone from strength to strength

2346179 from our modest beginnings in the tropicana cafe in 1993 to the domain in sydney and an audience of over 150 000 nationwide our growth could not have been possible without sonys undying enthusiasm we are enormously grateful for all of their support over the years

2346196 i think the question one needs to ask is if the army commander does not want a party that has indigenous platform as part of the manifesto in the next elections then really what is the point of having the elections at all

2346214 the injunction is relatively simple he has a contract with the bulldogs he is one year into a five year deal
2346215 the expectation was always that hed honour that commitment and this ensures that he cant play for anything other than whats in his contract
2346216 it is however a victory for the sanctity of a contract
2346217 its a victory for the commitment that one person makes to another its as simple as that
2346218 orders of court arent like referees telling players to stay onside orders of the court are serious matters and people who are responsible comply with them

2346220 we are prepared to continue during the course of an interlocutory argument to pay mr williams as per his payments to date 100 per cent of his contract
2346221 in other words even if he keeps playing rugby in toulon he is going to get a salary from the bulldogs
2346222 at the very least reasonable cause for apprehension that williams does not intend to play for the bulldogs although he has agreed to until 31 october 2012
2346223 the evidence before the court satisfies that williams has failed to attend to his contractual responsibilities
2346224 my conclusion is that the making of an interlocutory interim injunction will not be futile
2346225 you better come get your uncle i just killed him

2346230 i and my family are proud to be shia muslims and it is as a shia muslim and for demonstrating that islam is the religion of peace and tolerance that i have accepted to defend the right to citizenship of iranian bahais

2346245 every man in this house knows it is not a debt we cannot without the grossest corruption appropriate this money as the payment of a debt we have not the semblance of authority to appropriate it as charity mr speaker i have said we have the right to give as much money of our own as we please i am the poorest man on this floor i cannot vote for this bill but i will give one weeks pay to the object and if every member of congress will do the same it will amount to more than the bill asks
2346246 several years ago i was one evening standing on the steps of the capitol with some members of congress when our attention was attracted by a great light over in georgetown
2346247 the next summer when it began to be time to think about election i concluded i would take a scout around among the boys of my district
2346248 i began well friend i am one of those unfortunate beings called candidates and
2346249 yes i know you you are colonel crockett i have seen you once before and voted for you the last time you were elected i suppose you are out electioneering now but you had better not waste your time or mine i shall not vote for you again
2346250 this was a sockdolger i begged him tell me what was the matter
2346251 well colonel it is hardly worthwhile to waste time or words upon it
2346252 i intend by it only to say that your understanding of the constitution is very different from mine and i will say to you what but for my rudeness i should not have said that i believe you to be honest
2346253 i admit the truth of all you say but there must be some mistake
2346254 it is not the amount colonel that i complain of it is the principle
2346255 individual members may give as much of their own money as they please but they have no right to touch a dollar of the public money for that purpose
2346256 the congressmen chose to keep their own money which if reports be true some of them spend not very creditably and the people about washington no doubt applauded you for relieving them from necessity of giving what was not yours to give
2346257 so you see colonel you have violated the constitution in what i consider a vital point
2346258 i tell you i felt streaked i saw if i should have opposition and this man should go to talking and in that district i was a gone fawn skin i could not answer him and the fact is i was so fully convinced that he was right i did not want to but i must satisfy him and i said to him
2346259 well my friend you hit the nail upon the head when you said i had not sense enough to understand the constitution
2346260 he laughingly replied yes colonel you have sworn to that once before but i will trust you again upon one condition
2346261 if i dont said i i wish i may be shot and to convince you that i am in earnest in what i say i will come back this way in a week or ten days and if you will get up a gathering of people i will make a speech to them get up a barbecue and i will pay for it
2346262 no colonel we are not rich people in this section but we have plenty of provisions to contribute for a barbecue and some to spare for those who have none
2346263 well i will be here but one thing more before i say good bye i must know your name
2346264 well mr bunce i never saw you before though you say you have seen me but i know you very well i am glad i have met you and very proud that i may hope to have you for my friend
2346265 it was one of the luckiest hits of my life that i met him
2346266 at the appointed time i was at his house having told our conversation to every crowd i had met and to every man i stayed all night with and i found that it gave the people an interest and confidence in me stronger than i had ever seen manifested before
2346267 though i was considerably fatigued when i reached his house and under ordinary circumstances should have gone early to bed i kept him up until midnight talking about the principles and affairs of government and got more real true knowledge of them than i had got all my life before
2346268 i have known and seen much of him since for i respect him no that is not the word i reverence and love him more than any living man and i go to see him two or three times every year and i will tell you sir if every one who professes to be a christian lived and acted and enjoyed it as he does the religion of christ would take the world by storm
2346269 but to return to my story the next morning we went to the barbecue and to my surprise found about a thousand men there i met a good many whom i had not known before and they and my friend introduced me around until i had got pretty well acquainted at least they all knew me
2346270 in due time notice was given that i would speak to them they gathered up around a stand that had been erected i opened my speech by saying
2346271 fellow citizens i present myself before you today feeling like a new man my eyes have lately been opened to truths which ignorance or prejudice or both had heretofore hidden from my view i feel that i can today offer you the ability to render you more valuable service than i have ever been able to render before i am here today more for the purpose of acknowledging my error than to seek your votes that i should make this acknowledgment is due to myself as well as to you whether you will vote for me is a matter for your consideration only
2346272 i went on to tell them about the fire and my vote for the appropriation and then told them why i was satisfied it was wrong i closed by saying
2346273 and now fellow citizens it remains only for me to tell you that the most of the speech you have listened to with so much interest was simply a repetition of the arguments by which your neighbor mr bunce convinced me of my error
2346274 it is the best speech i ever made in my life but he is entitled to the credit for it and now i hope he is satisfied with his convert and that he will get up here and tell you so
2346275 fellow citizens it affords me great pleasure to comply with the request of colonel crockett i have always considered him a thoroughly honest man and i am satisfied that he will faithfully perform all that he has promised you today
2346276 he went down and there went up from that crowd such a shout for davy crockett as his name never called forth before
2346277 i am not much given to tears but i was taken with a choking then and felt some big drops rolling down my cheeks
2346278 i just turn up on the sand and start to create an image off the top of my head
2346279 im very disappointed to hear that sen ted kennedy of massachusetts is near death because of a brain tumor i always hoped sen kennedy would live long enough to be assassinated i wonder if he got a card from the kopechnes

2346291 no one is safe today from the negative impact of poor application performance whether youre a gamer a retail outlet or a salesforce com user
2346292 the question is how much money do you have to lose if the application starts crawling along at traffic jam speeds
2346293 in the past we were managing the infrastructure which really doesnt get into how the application is performing for the end users
2346294 we need to be able to be aware of and see all of the pieces that make up an application and how they affect the end user to understand when performance is going to be impacted he says
2346295 we have had instances in which a performance problem would occur because something had been put on the network such as a network interface card or a port that causes a problem with an application such as voice

2346322 air pacific is a stagnating airline its profit is declining it is not expanding no new major international destinations have been added to its flight network in the past two decades it is also beset by serious employee relations problems
2346323 it is ridiculous for anyone to say that as the major shareholder the fiji government should sit back and not take timely action to set things right to avert
2346324 as fijis flagship carrier it is expected to contribute to a vibrant tourism industry by exploring expansion into new markets and destinations but we have not seen the national airline embark on any new initiatives in the past two decades
2346325 air pacific board and senior management have to take full responsibility for the poor state of the airline today
2346326 this is why we need to review the shareholding agreement with qantas airways to ensure that fijis national interest is not compromised by this partnership
2346327 we will as a major shareholder make a submission to the review at the appropriate time the spokesman said
2346328 however we reject totally the assertion that any perceived inertia in air pacific is the result of qantas dominance the opposite is the case we have provided operational and commercial support only when requested
2346329 this is why we need to review the shareholding agreement with qantas to ensure fijis national interest is not compromised by this partnership
2346330 air pacific is a stagnating airline its profit is declining it is not expanding no new major international destinations have been added to its flight network in the past decade
2346331 government has 51 per cent shares in air pacific however despite this the government of fiji is unable to exercise powers that it may normally do as a majority shareholder
2346332 for example under the articles of association qantas which owns 46 per cent of air pacific has veto powers in a number of key operational areas
2346333 these include the commencement of any new air routes the issuance of shares the adoption of an annual operating budget the adoption or material variation by the directors of a dividend policy of the company and the entry by air pacific into any major commercial agreement
2346334 will undertake further exercises to give government a true picture of its position as 51 per cent shareholder of air pacific
2346335 its the shareholders prerogative and the government owns 51 percent of the company the appointments are done by the shareholders themselves
2346336 the government has the final say in regards to the fiji directors fiji has five and qantas has four the appointments are done on a yearly basis and done at the annual meeting which is usually held in september
2346337 whats come out in the news is news to us were working on confirming the new members and who will be replaced

2346339 another worrying development in cyberspace is the abuse of blogging which allows anonymous individuals to post defamatory comments about anyone they choose without the legal consequences they would face in other more reputable print and electronic media

2346356 2 if youre the u s ryder cup captain and youre focused less on your own game and more on how youll fill out your team then youre probably not going to win sorry zinger
2346357 3 one of these days k j choi or ryuji imada will win a major and the no asian player has ever won a major curse will be over but until then well eliminate
2346358 4 as you likely have heard no european player has won the pga championship since the silver scot tommy armour won in 1930 now given how well the europeans played at oakland hills in the 2004 ryder cup when they trounced the americans you listening zinger it seems that if the euros are ever going to break that drought this would be the week and maybe padraig harrington makes it two straight majors which would set him up nicely as a player of the year candidate but 76 years of history cant be ignored so lets eliminate all the europeans paul casey nick dougherty simon dyson ross fisher ian poulter justin rose steve webster lee westwood oliver wilson england alex cejka martin kaymer germany daniel chopra niclas fasth peter hanson peter hedblom frederik jacobson richard s johnson robert karlsson carl pettersson henrik stenson sweden darren clarke graeme mcdowell northern ireland alastair forsyth colin montgomerie scotland sergio garcia miguel angel jimenez pablo larrazabal spain anders hansen soren hansen soren kjeldsen
2346359 5 so no european has ever won the pga since it became a stroke play event 50 years ago the south africans can at least claim a couple of stroke play wins of course the last one was gary players second pga championship victory in 1972 and while its never good to count out a south african player in any major trevor immelman showed us that at augusta national in april the seasons last major simply hasnt been fruitful for that country in the past 25 years so lets eliminate tim clark ernie els retief goosen trevor immelman james kingston louis oosthuizen hennie otto rory sabbatini charl schwartzel players eliminated 9 remaining field 88
2346360 6 in fact lets face it other than vijay singhs wins in 1998 and 2004 the pga championship has been an american showcase the last 12 years in fact besides singh the only other former pga championship winner in the field this week who isnt an american is steve elkington the australian who won at riviera in 1995 now consider one other thing since 1994 u s players have won at least two of the four majors in a given year since tiger woods u s open win is the only major won by an american this year history overwhelmingly favors the red white and blue this week were not going to eliminate singh just yet especially coming off his win sunday at firestone but as difficult as it may be were going to eliminate every other international player robert allenby stuart appleby aaron baddeley steve elkington matthew goggin richard green brendan jones peter lonard geoff ogilvy nick ohern rod pampling adam scott john senden scott strange australia stephen ames mike weir canada mark brown michael campbell new zealand angel cabrera andres romero argentina camilo villegas colombia players eliminated 21 remaining field 67
2346361 7 all right weve eliminated 89 players in just six steps now it gets even tougher here at the pga tour though were a big believer in fedexcup points especially as it relates to recent performances so lets take the last eight weeks if you havent managed to cobble together at least 1 500 points during that time then either a your game is not in tip top primed to win a major shape or b youve missed tournaments which means youre either hurt or rusty either way youre eliminated fedexcup points in the last eight weeks in parentheses michael allen 1 069 briny baird 1 361 rich beem 252 mark brooks 51 bart bryant 317 jonathan byrd 340 mark calcavecchia 413 fred couples 476 ben crane 403 ben curtis 1 198 john daly 0 chris dimarco 1 070 steve flesch 349 brian gay 1 281 paul goydos 174 jay haas 0 todd hamilton 789 j j henry 162 j b holmes 180 charles howell iii 757 zach johnson 521 jerry kelly 423 greg kraft 163 cliff kresge 974 tom lehman 323 justin leonard 881 davis love iii 485 steve lowery 390 john mallinger 169 george mcneill 453 john merrick 1 471 ryan moore 76 corey pavin 1 373 pat perez 637 jeff quinney 224 brandt snedeker 775 steve stricker 1 288 kevin sutherland 1 257 vaughn taylor 759 nicholas thompson 1 301 david toms 297 scott verplank 821 johnson wagner 285 boo weekley 266 players eliminated 44 remaining field 23
2346362 8 in the pga championships stroke play era no winner has ever had less than four letters in his last name we hate to break it to you mr kim and mr wi but your fate at this event was decided at birth players eliminated 2 remaining field 21
2346363 9 in tournament history just seven players have made the pga championship their first win on the pga tour and its been done just three times since 1957 jeff sluman in 1988 john daly in 1991 and shaun micheel in 2003 obviously it can be done but we suggest that it wont be done this week thus eliminating players eliminated 3 remaining field 18
2346364 10 speaking of first timers how about the players involved in their first pga championship while both these guys are young aggressive and coming off recent tour wins they may need a little more seasoning before winning a major so lets eliminate players eliminated 2 remaining field 16
2346365 11 whos outside the top 50 in the official world golf rankings well if youre are its time to say goodbye tommy armour iii chad campbell billy mayfair heath slocum d j trahan bob tway who made it all the way to our sweet 16 despite being ranked 322nd in the world dean wilson players eliminated 7 remaining field 9
2346366 14 arbitrary reasons why i think tiger woods will the masters
2346367 guys who probably wont win because they arent as good as the other players in the field
2346368 12 ok were feeling good about our final nine along with some big names we have several dark horse candidates and the pga championship is the major that seems to lend itself most to a surprise winner in fact of the 89 previous pgas nearly half 44 have been won by players who were winning their first major that speaks volumes as a result its time to jettison arguably the three biggest names left jim furyk phil mickelson vijay singh players eliminated 3 remaining field 6
2346369 13 time to look at ages of those previous 89 winners 40 have come from the 30 34 age group whoops none of the six left qualify there but 19 have come from the 35 39 age group and 18 from the 25 29 age group while just five champions have been 40 or older so time to eliminate the ahem older guys woody austin 44 years old rocco mediate 45 kenny perry 47 players eliminated 3 remaining field 3
2346370 14 so that leaves us with the trio of stewart cink hunter mahan and sean ohair surprised we are although maybe its not the shocker one might think all three have won at least one tour event all three are ranked in the top 30 of fedexcup points all three have finished in the top 20 of at least one major this year and when all three finish their careers we can see at least one major win on each of their resumes but lets face it only one of those three is overdue to win a major this year cink has tied for third at the masters and 14th at the u s open he won for the fifth time on tour travelers championship and has six other top 10 finishes in 08 so theres our winner stewart cink its his time
2346371 out of the darkness of my life so much frustrated i put before you the one great thing to love on earth the blessed sacrament there you will find romance glory honour fidelity and the true way of all your loves on earth and more than that death by the divine paradox that which ends life and demands the surrender of all and yet by the taste or foretaste of which alone can what you seek in your earthly relationships love faithfulness joy be maintained or take on that complexion of reality of eternal endurance which every mans heart desires the only cure for sagging or fainting faith is communion though always itself perfect and complete and inviolate the blessed sacrament does not operate completely and once for all in any of us like the act of faith it must be continuous and grow by exercise frequency is of the highest effect seven times a week is more nourishing than seven times at intervals also i can recommend this as an exercise alas only too easy to find opportunity for make your communion in circumstances that affront your taste choose a snuffling or gabbling priest or a proud and vulgar friar and a church full of the usual bourgeois crowd ill behaved children from those who yell to those products of catholic schools who the moment the tabernacle is opened sit back and yawn open necked and dirty youths women in trousers and often with hair both unkempt and uncovered go to communion with them and pray for them it will be just the same or better than that as a mass said beautifully by a visibly holy man and shared by a few devout and decorous people it could not be worse than the mess of the feeding of the five thousand after which our lord propounded the feeding that was to come

2346436 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue

2346438 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us

2346539 start good and slow won easily second and third driving regret from a fast start and well ridden took the lead at once and was rated in front until the last eighth where she drew away to win easing up
2346540 annually for many years past this event has been looked upon as the biggest race in the united states and the glamor that surrounds this years race eclipses the previous races by far
2346541 louisville may 8 regret the wonderful daughter of broomstick owned by h
2346542 this time 2 05 2 5 was surprising as it was believed that the old track record would go by the boards
2346543 the race was run and won on its merits with the best one of the lot winning the filly was hardly blowing when she pulled up within the charmed circle before the judges stand she was given the greatest ovation ever given a winner of the derby
2346544 it was 5 23 before starter morrissey got the field off regret showed in front with pebbles hanging close up they passed the stand in this way with emerson cochran showing a brief flash of speed
2346545 at the mile borel made a determined bid with pebbles but notter loosened a wrap on the representative of h p whitney and she came on to win with much in reserve
2346546 mr whitney witnessed the victory of his filly other visitors included william f mccombs new york chairman of the democratic national committee former united states senator johnson n camden james butler foxhall keene andrew miller barney dreyfuss and august belmont
2346547 regret was installed favorite in the betting but so open was the content thought to be that a 2 winning mutuel tickets paid 7 30
2346548 looking backward over all the derby races run in the united states it is difficult to find a counterpart of what the kentucky derby bids fair to be this spring it is very probable that even in numbers the field will break all previous records while in class the like has never before been quite so great the greatest number of starters that even went to post in this race was in its inaugural year 1875 when fifteen three year olds faced the starter
2346549 has headed the list of winning sires for the last two seasons and the start he has made this year indicates that he will enjoy that honor again in 1915
2346550 entjs are natural born leaders they live in a world of possibilities where they see all sorts challenges to be surmounted and they want to be the ones responsible for surmounting them they have a drive for leadership which is well served by their quickness to grasp complexities their ability to absorb a large amount of impersonal information and their quick and decisive judgments
2346551 have a strong natural urge to give structure and direction wherever they are to harness people in the field and to direct them to achieve distant goals
2346552 leader ambitious hard working dominant prepared hates to be bored confident opinionated analytical
2346553 at work entjs contribute a wealth of energy directed toward the goals and those of the organization their sense of identity is closely tied to how they carry out their responsibilities they are curious about new ideas and theories evaluating them in terms of their goals they are very efficient competitive strategic and task focused
2346554 what the heck after being sixth the media day vote in l a in the pac 10 whats going on here theres some inconsistencies going on here
2346555 i guess the media people or personnel or whatever you want to call them they understand that we finish strong said hughes who is smooth enough to be working a sideline somewhere for espn
2346556 as long as we can come out and start fast were almost guaranteed to finish strong said hughes noting how the beavers 2008 schedule is top loaded
2346557 we have a lot of guys who have been backups who have played theyre just stepping in as starters now he said noting the likes of bryant cornell and keaton kristick and others
2346558 we have a good team here and its good to have somebody recognize it said hughes
2346559 hey as long as we can come out and back it up thats all that matters to me said hughes
2346560 at the end of the day we still have to come out and play
2346561 all along weve known that we are a good football team so rankings dont really matter he said
2346562 no no one enjoys that no one enjoys that we enjoy hard work thats what we pride ourselves on but no one enjoys being overlooked not disrespected but no one enjoys not having people expect much from them
2346563 i guess you could see its some kind of respect theyre giving us does it surprise me not really it kinda surprises me that were still having a hard time finding out way to the top but it all falls into place after the seasons over so were not really falling back on that
2346564 this was a very positive step for both my clients and my career in luxury real estate
2346565 to be aligned with respected names such as florence shapiro and ivan sher is extremely humbling not to mention exciting
2346566 his genuine love for helping people fits right in with the focus of the shapiro amp sher group
2346567 it gives me a chance to make a name for myself while protecting the names of others
2346568 war started today in south ossetia when georgia attacked russian peacekeepers in the disputed region
2346569 if its not war then we are very close to it the russians have invaded georgia and we are under attack
2346570 russia is fighting a war with us in our own territory
2346571 this is a clear intrusion on another countrys territory we have russian tanks on our territory jets on our territory in broad daylight
2346572 hey i understand ive been through that sh t we all are kakis abang adek
2346573 the totalitarian regime fell thanks in large part to him thanks to him the people understood that they themselves could oppose evil
2346574 solzhenitsyn served only god not the government not democracy not even america only god thats why he was a free person
2346575 i would go see that in the theater with you

2346581 this is a breakthrough in terms of our understanding of materials and thats important because in order to understand the long term evolution of planets we need to know more about their properties deep down
2346582 the finding is also interesting from the point of view of understanding why materials are the way they are and what determines their stability and their physical and chemical properties
2346583 you can imagine this liquid looking like mercury only less reflective
2346584 high temperatures make the atoms jiggle around and so people thought that raising the heat would deflect the electrons like putting enough rocks in a stream to block the flow of water
2346585 the scattering caused by atoms was thought to make it harder for the electrons to flow down the stream
2346586 the attendance morever was not restricted to any one locality nor to any one class
2346587 where do we come in demanded the fieldstand we might as well be in battle creek mich the ponies dont look no biggern pug dogs when they get within a couple of miles of the finish and from the upper tiers of the grandstand came another lament the only way a man can get up here and back in the same afternoon is by use of a balloon or a flying machine it complained and one individual went so far as to assert that he left his seat in ample time to bet the first race and got there just in time to hear that king pepper had won the last race
2346588 the scheme of running races the reverse way of the track which the crowd insisted upon calling the wrong way had a tendency to confuse the spectators who were not accustomed to it and threw them momentarily out of stride
2346589 but all this faultfinding was inspired because of the strangeness and newness and bigness of the surroundings and when the regulars for whom most of it came adapt themselves to the new order of things belmont park will undoubtedly become the most popular racing inclosure sic in the country
2346590 this is welcome news because a rise in contract activity is necessary for an overall housing recovery
2346591 we propose an extensible component operating system architecture in which an operating system kernel uses reflection to process c pure virtual function based system calls and upcalls to provide a unified programming environment for application server and kernel development we found that we could even develop file subsystems and a tcp ip protocol stack on an existing operating system based on this architecture
2346592 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
2346593 puedes estar contemplando una casa espectacular a la que no le falta un detalle y con s lo darte la vuelta adentrarte en estrechas callejuelas llenas de peque as construcciones a las que les falta de todo
2346594 es algo as como si las chabolas de la ca ada real de madrid estuvieran frente a los palecetes del barrio de salamanca dif cil de imaginar verdad
2346595 la tierra no es escasa y los factores de producci n tienen un componente local comparativamente bajo as como acceso a la mano de obra
2346596 en estos mercados y en las grandes ciudades se aprecian precios para vivienda de lujo que pueden superar los 3 000 euros el metro cuadrado tanto para primera como para segunda residencia
2346597 el pa s se encuentra en franca expansi n y se respira optimismo hay un d ficit acumulado de primera vivienda y esto representa una gran oportunidad de crecimiento
2346598 no va a terminar hasta que los precios encuentren un nuevo nivel razonable es decir que se equilibren la oferta y la demanda

2346603 take responsibility to verify the eligibility of mr barack h obama to be president of the united states
2346604 mr obama has refused to produce a physical certified stamped copy of his birth certificate an electronically displayed imaged displayed by his official campaign website has alleged to have been a forgery we request that the fec require mr obama to authorize the fec to obtain an official copy of his birth certificate
2346605 the least experienced politician in at least one hundred years to obtain a major party nomination for president
2346606 too many of those criticizing obama have been content merely to slander him
2346607 silently and at times vocally cooperated with chicagos democratic machine
2346608 daley considered palmer a serious threat a potential mayoral rival
2346609 by clearing the ballot obama had done more than just elbow his way into power without a real election he had also erased any doubt of daleys path to his next term
2346610 he did not campaign for john stroger or even endorse him
2346611 hendon had been the original sponsor of two bills that obama often writes and speaks about as if they had been his own one required the taping of murder interrogations to help eliminate mistakes in the sic illinoiss death penalty system and the other was designed to reduce the incidence of racial profiling by the police
2346612 the murder interrogation bill requiring videotaping of interrogations in all capital cases was an excellent example of something with a broad bipartisan consensus in all but the minutest details coming as it did after thirteen death row inmates were found to have been falsely convicted in illinois
2346613 in hindsight it was best to go ahead with the weaker version because a lot of police attitudes changed when we passed it
2346614 would bark their displeasure at me and then theyd unload on obama
2346615 if barack obama is a reformer he may be the first reformer ever to become president of the united states before doing anything serious in the name of reform
2346616 was a real accomplishment for obama in the name of reform
2346617 theres never been a single time in senator obamas political career where he did something that was difficult and would cost him politically for the sake of needed reforms and change
2346618 he deserves full credit for opposing the war at a time when his position was not necessarily popular
2346619 obama has enjoyed success due to the failures of others
2346620 in the final weeks everything was pointing toward a hull victory
2346621 obama is currently running the first real political campaign of his life
2346622 the gospel stories of sick people hoping to touch even the hem of christs garments or hoping that saint peters shadow might pass over them and bring healing
2346623 hidden in obamas shapeless rhetoric about change and hope is a dangerous agenda that will take on real substance if he is given power
2346624 this bill would effectively cancel every state federal and local regulation of abortion no matter how modest or reasonable
2346625 obama is one of the very few pro choice advocates who accepts no restrictions on late term abortions or any kind of abortions
2346626 most antiabortion activists for example have openly discouraged legislative allies from even pursuing those compromise measures that would have significantly reduced the incidence of the procedure popularly known as partial birth abortion because the image the procedure evokes in the mind of the public has helped them win converts to their position
2346627 this questions not only the sincerity of pro lifers but also their dedication to their own cause
2346628 about 130 times over his eight year career there which other illinois senators say is unusually high
2346629 the average teacher in thornton township district was earning 83 000 that year
2346630 with teachers that expensive how could any such school district afford to keep teachers for a full school day
2346631 those on the left often find themselves defending an indefensible status quo insisting that more spending alone will improve educational outcomes
2346632 if i am the democratic nominee i will aggressively pursue an agreement with the republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election
2346633 my plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce return excess money from donors and stay within the public financing system for the general election
2346634 he was simply voting the party line the union line
2346635 he is a rigid doctrinaire liberal who votes and thinks along his party line
2346636 what do these relationships tell us about his judgment and the type of people with whom he will entrust executive powers if elected
2346637 this incident reveals far more about obamas political thinking than did the words of his conciliatory keynote convention speech
2346638 sought the endorsement of the marxist new party in chicago
2346639 it would be foolish to fear barack obama just because he had a communist father figure when he was young
2346640 if obama could understand and get along with radicals like palmer ayers and dohrn it is not because he agrees with everything they stand for it is probably because they share similar ideological influences
2346641 of greatest significance are the radical advisors with whom senator obama surrounds himself even now
2346642 it would be unreasonable to expect obama to accept as advisors only those who agree with every single belief he holds
2346643 would you join a church that proclaimed itself to be grounded in the writings of a racist
2346644 based upon the systematized liberation theology that started in 1969 with the publication of dr james cones seminal book black power and black theology
2346645 cones writings provide the context from within which the founding influences of obamas former church come
2346646 the rap against obama on foreign policy is not that sic so much that hes inconsistent but that he doesnt know what hes doing
2346647 make a substantial difference on the situation on the ground
2346648 obama seems wholly unaware of liberal democrats opposition to the policies that helped destroy the soviet union and even certain legislators collaboration with the soviets
2346649 he is especially disdainful of the so called star wars program which was crucial to bankrupting the soviets then
2346650 obama paid twice the tax assessed price for a ten foot wide strip of rezkos lot
2346651 but he has obama performed official acts while in office that benefited tony rezko
2346652 the last 10 to 15 years have seen particularly dangerous declines in rainfall in sensitive ecosystems in east africa such as somalia and eastern ethiopia
2346653 we wanted to know if the trend would continue or if it would start getting wetter
2346654 this 15 percent decrease in rainfall over eastern africa every 20 25 years is likely to continue

2346667 i am happy when i walk into the kitchen and i think what i make shows that
2346668 i graduated from a traditional school and i saw too many people get a job in a field that had nothing to do with what they studied in school but with the art institute students they graduate and go out and do something they love

2346679 shannen has emerged as a voice for the so called forgotten children
2346680 the childrens peace prize is given to children who have made a significant contribution to advancing childrens rights
2346681 the government of canada seems to have forgotten that the right to a proper education is a fundamental human right but shannen isnt content to be treated as a second class citizen she has emerged as an inspiring young leader who is waging a fight that has international significance
2346682 minister strahl told me he had other priorities than building a school maybe he thinks we will just lose hope and give up
2346683 but i was always taught by my parents to stand up and speak for what i believe in i told him the children wont give up we will keep moving forward walking proud in our moccasins until we are given justice

2346741 i like this writers way with words valentine is an amazing book that everyone shoul read he builds a good plot and develops his characters well i would give it 5 stars out of 5
2346742 jamieson wolf writes with some of the strongest emotion i have found in ages his passion is reminiscent of that seen in the works of shakespeare and others of that time period his characters love deeply and without restraint overcoming every obstacle placed before them this is truly a tale for all those who believe love has no boundaries
2346743 jamieson wolf is what i would call a fabulous storyteller he dreams up or gets visited by great characters and he paints them vividly when he writes he gets fantastic story ideas and pounds them out in a way that makes you lean in toward the computer screen or flip through the physical pages faster and faster to see whats happening to these people next
2346744 this book is great this is a must read book for any body who loves ghost fantasy supernatural fun a surprise around every corner awaits the reader i am so happy to have purchased this book and add it to my own family library we just have to wait until jamieson wolf gets another fun book out there for all of us to read well worth it for your own fun reading and for your book collection a five star rating from me love it

2346760 exactly when these leaders will go post ward is uncertain as all three are entered in at least two stake events war admiral and seabiscuit are scheduled to meet each other in the riggs and the bowie with the possibility of war admiral being favored in the pimlico special
2346761 if war admiral goes in the pimlico special which is for 3 year olds exclusively and will be run on wednesday he will most likely have to meet heefly burning star eagle pass delloe strabo and war minstrel
2346762 in the three and upward class the handicap champion seabiscuit will most likely face calumet dick war admiral cabellero ii fair knightess burning star and host of others
2346763 on three mornings of the 10 day meeting the track will be the scene of more than just the usual routine on friday november 5 there will be a race for gentlemen riders over the flat on saturday futurity day there will be a parade of maryland stallions and on monday there will be the auction of the stable of cornelius vanderbilt whitney who has announced his retirement from racing
2346764 war admiral goes again today providing that track conditions do not change before post time the champion meets horses of his own age in the 7 500 pimlico special and despite top impost of 128 pounds promises to continue his winning streak he gives away from 13 to 30 pounds and with few exceptions he meets horses which have finished behind him before trainer george conway had him on the track this morning and the man o war colt stepped a half in 51 it was reveled that war admiral has been named for the 50 000 widener challenge cup and the 100 000 santa anita handicap both events are on march 5 and the riddle forces will choose one of those races soon this will be the first time that the glen riddle farm has raced in winter in years and is concrete evidence that the owner riddle intends to send war admiral after sun beaus all time money winning crown war admiral will be going the distance he prefers today a mile and three sixteenths the same route at which he won the preakness here
2346765 this announcement was made tonight by samuel d riddle owner of the 3 year old champion following the admirals poor showing in winning the pimlico special this afternoon trainer george conway will be given a two month vacation
2346766 in trouble for the first time in his career despite the vest pocket field
2346767 war admiral went to the post one of the shortest favorites in maryland history
2346768 despite the fact that few race fans believed that there was a chance in a million of war admiral being extended the program drew a crowd of 15 000 and 57 487 was wagered on the feature event
2346769 war admirals time for the race was 1 58 4 5 a fraction over the track record and two fifths of a second slower than his preakness victory over the same ground last spring
2346770 as had been the case since the start of the year
2346771 only masked general war minstrel and bottle cap lined up with the champion and masked general was the longest shot of the quartet
2346772 war minstrel lunged to the front at the break and war admiral appeared to lug out soon finding himself between war minstrel and bottle cap
2346773 war admiral failed to do the expected when he did not go though between his rivals instead he dropped back as war minstrel became a definite leader turning into the back stretch
2346774 war minstrel then began to fade like a shot masked general went to the top and gradually opened a lead there were groans from the stands wasnt war admiral doing his best and under punishment at that wasnt masked general running rather easily and not under punishment
2346775 the came the break that spelled victory for war admiral
2346776 eccard rallied masked general some but inside the sixteenth pole kurtsinger looked back and then began taking in the reins
2346777 trainer george conway said this morning that war admiral and other members of the glen riddle stable will be sent to the farm at berlin md on monday willie doyle patrol judge at the turnout of the backstretch said that he thought war admiral would have overhauled masked general even if the latter had run true and not bore out doyle said war admiral had just started to run when he left the backstretch jockey charlie kurtsinger reported that war admiral was inclined to loaf in the early stages but when he struck him at the five eighths pole the champion began running kurtsinger said that masked general began bearing out leaving the backstretch
2346778 most racing experts did not give the pimlico special an outside chance to attain the prestige of a world series or a rose bowl by last week however the pimlico special a weight for age affair at a mile and three sixteenths for three year olds and up was recognized as the annual post season race that determines the u s thoroughbred champion some 25 000 turf fans crammed into pimlicos mid victorian stands to see if this years special would be as dramatic as the first two

2346785 in thousands of autos and dozens of buses by train and by plane the fans arrived they came early eager for a thorough inspection of the 657 acre plant and its up to the minute features and long before the first post time of 2 30 all the 16 000 seas were filled late comers had to settle for standing room out in the sun in the concrete lawn
2346786 the track built in the middle of the new jersey pines on a site that once was a golf course was about 95 per cent complete for this inaugural program benches were borrowed from delaware park because all the seats werent in operation the automatic sprinkler system wasnt ready to do any sprinkling and the television tower wasnt doing any televising but all the essential machinery in a smooth working race track was working and apparently working well
2346787 jon sloan the architect who was a member of the new york racing commission from 1934 to 1942 designed the track and he planned it with the comfort of the fans firmly in mind he built the hipodromo de las americas in mexico city and the garden state track at camden he also built such notable new york city structures as the graybar building the chanin building the pershing square building 29 broadway and 80 broad street

2346846 we are only a slave to the energy the energy and the emotion
2346847 we dont care about genres why would we for us it was just about being what we are we arent limited by anything other than our imaginations and what we feel so why would we make music packaged into a little box
2346848 it was something we were watching on television on the discovery channel on the phenomenon of synesthesia and we realized that was how we see hear and make music
2346849 thats how its always been we just never knew there was a name to it and when we learned about it we knew it had to be the title of the album
2346850 but sometimes the wires are a little crossed when you hear a sound instead of just your brain receiving electric impulses and then interpreting them something happens and it invokes other things a feeling a memory an emotion thats how we make music
2346851 its been five years since our last album and weve seen and heard and done a lot in our lives
2346852 we feel free and we need to express that its like were doing it for the first time all over again

2346854 all the ladies standing in the line for the bathroom
2346855 its an observation of what weve seen and it captures that sex drugs and rock n roll mentality
2346856 that was the most important thing we know what we want to do on stage we want to get fucking crazy fucking insane and if we make pussy soft songs no ones going to want to jump
2346857 no one will ever know what kind of a rush it is on stage to play these kinds of songs until you experience it for yourself but thats the thing we wanted to give that feeling to our audience
2346858 they come from so many different walks of life there are so many archetypes in our crowds and they all meet up here in that moment with our music thats a beautiful thing and we have to honor that in our music

2346873 the last time a derby horse went down was 1974 when flip sal went lame according to the race chart and was pulled up in 1970 holy land clipped heels with another horse on the second turn and fell in 1932 liberty limited broke down and busy american did the same in 1922
2346874 the kentucky derby field will include ten horses if busy american goes to post the e r bradley ace is in a bad way suffering from a bowed tendon trainer thompson said today that he did not know what mr bradley would do when he saw the colt but in all probability he would not start
2346875 the colt could run in the derby but chances are that he would never run another race remarked trainer thompson as he pointed to the bow and touched it with his thumb and forefinger the colt flinched perceptibly showing that the spot was sore but he did not seem to be so lame while he was walking around the shed mr bradley will determine when he arrives tomorrow whether the colt will start
2346876 trainer thomas sic said today that busy american had shown him more than any colt he had ever trained and that he beleived if he had not bowed a tendon he surely would have won the derby he appears to be a colt which has been overtrained he looks to be sour and has a disposition to bear out in the turns which indicates he is sore
2346877 swinging around the club house turn busy american bore out and immediately thereafter broke down that bowed tendon rapidly repaired had played him false
2346878 the field which comprised nine horses was the fourth choice getting strong backing in the strength of the presence of brandon mint and liberty limited the latter making his first start as a 3 year old after having been stopped in training by bad feet he fell lame in the running
2346879 brother joe ran coupled with burgoo king today but broke down and brought up the rear with the crippled liberty limited
2346880 there was also a mishap in the final phase when holy land slipped his bridle and threw his rider hector pilar
2346881 the first time in 34 years that a derby horse finished without a rider
2346882 but the saddest broken dream involved flip sal a colt owned by salvatore tufano and benjamin cohen of long island and named for tufanos two sons flip sal winner of a division of the wood memorial at aqueduct fractured his left ankle after a half mile as cannonade cantered slowly back to the winners enclosure with cordero waving his high whip high in the air in jubilation a small white tractor drawn ambulance was taking flip sal away fat across the track on the backstretch the chances of saving his life were considered slight
2346883 flip sal a casualty of this years kentucky derby has become the darling of the american public as he waits a decision on whether he lives or dies
2346884 get well cards and letters flow daily to churchill downs for the colt who smashed his front left leg halfway around the track in the 100th derby
2346885 dear flip sal and 8 year old from altoona pa wrote i hope you feel better i was sorry to hear about your leg you are a beautiful horse
2346886 the mail addressed to the colt his veterinarian dr gary lavin or just to churchill downs some offer to pay his medical bills others offer a home for the colt and many ask for his picture
2346887 flip sal a horse that was injured in the backstretch of the kentucky derby may 4 will not be destroyed as had been feared after the injury
2346888 a veterinarian dr gary lavin of louisville said today weve reached the point where the odds are in his favor he will be retired to stud
2346889 lavin said there was no chance that flip sal would race again

2346894 the real explosion was around 1995 with the advent of cd rom drives
2346895 before that the music was stored on cartridges the technology was so limited you had these horrible synthesised sounds
2346896 must be able to write in all styles from cartoon music to full orchestral scores
2346897 theres absolutely no difference between a good orchestral score to a game and the score to a film
2346898 theres absolutely no musical phrasing or dynamics or expressive techniques
2346899 i dont believe playing music that people dont want to hear is the right way of doing it
2346900 i think we should be playing music people know and in the young generation what people know are the motion pictures games and anime theyre used to watching game music is a medium that eminence is passionate about at the same time we want to use it to make the younger generation realise that symphonic music is not something to be left alone in dusty corners
2346901 when youre creating a film score you know whats going to happen at any given moment whereas in a video game its really down to the player about when those moments happen in time
2346902 what we try to do in the game industry is to figure out a way of making the transitions happen so theyre completely seamless so the player doesnt necessarily know but the score peaks and troughs at exactly the right moment and backs up the tension or drama or emotional response
2346903 the music is driving the player because its reflecting whats happening
2346904 interactive music is the most important thing about game music
2346905 as new consoles come out the production values just keep going higher and higher
2346906 its growing up and were getting to a point now where the production values of audio as with other elements of games like animation is really challenging the quality of other mediums such as film and in some cases arguably bettering it and thats going to continue
2346907 had to draw on the original elements of the retro sounds especially all the old sound effects featured in the game
2346908 i think that there was some fantastic stuff done in the earlier days
2346909 what these guys were able to squeeze out of that one little sound chip was incredible they werent necessarily programmers but they had to get their fingers dirty writing lines of code to get the music to play

2346916 well i do have cancer its just not any kind of cancer that can be made sense of or detected or that makes any sort of rational sense my cancer is beyond our puny powers of understanding
2346917 well the nature of the big empty void is so beyond our comprehension we just cant grasp how there can be no god the void is mysterious especially when it seem to be inhabited by a god who doesnt exist
2346918 this is something that i am not interesting in subjecting to any serious rational scrutiny im not interested in problems contradictions falsehoods and confusions within my view im just going to believe no matter what
2346919 i have just chosen to believe despite all of the evidence that you need a new 3 000 engine

2346922 i can still make cakes i want to go to vikingland to make cakes
2346923 vikingland is our sworn enemy you cannot go to vikingland unless we allow it and we will not allow it
2346924 well if you will not allow it i want to make cakes again here
2346925 but weve already replaced you there is no room for two cake makers in our town
2346926 i wish to challenge the new cake maker to a duel then then you will see that i am the superior cake maker
2346927 we do not care if you might be slightly better now we are thinking of the future of our town and this cake maker will be here for many years you will just leave the next time you feel tired
2346928 we can still have one more year of bretts cakes
2346929 suppose brett blows up the kitchen and makes no good cakes we will have wasted our new baker for nothing no brett should stay retired
2346930 i am more famous than the other baker i have brought much gold into this territory make them let me go to vikingland
2346931 yes you have brought much gold into this territory however you overestimate your value because we would have had this gold anyway i can only force them to keep you but i cannot dictate what else they do with you

2346997 when one plan doesnt work out for eric massa he flips and tries something else
2346998 a vote for eric massa is a vote for a rubberstamp of speaker nancy pelosi and the do nothing drill nothing democratic majority in congress who refuse to allow a vote on an energy plan that includes drilling
2346999 mr massas energy plan 2 0 is heavy on the taxes light on the facts and wont do much to bring down the price of gasoline but hey theres always next time
2347000 r elease 10 of the strategic petroleum reserve to drive down gas prices tomorrow
2347001 massa opposes releasing petroleum from the strategic oil reserve mainly for national security reasons but also because it wont work even if we drain every drop out of the louisiana salt domes it would have no effect on price at the pump
2347002 require big oil corporations to start drilling in the american soil and offshore sites theyve already leased if they refuse to drill the federal government should rescind the leases
2347003 t his policy already is the law of the land indeed federal energy lease holders already must produce oil or natural gas within five to 10 years after drilling on the land begins and the secretary of the interior has the power to cancel the lease if the energy company fails to comply
2347004 t here are currently 68 million acres of land that have been leased by oil and gas companies but are not being used
2347005 the fact is that those leases on 68 million acres are already under a use it or lose it process
2347006 under existing law producers can lease a block for up to 10 years but a company typically must begin producing oil or gas in that time or lose the lease

2347015 la divulgazione dei nostri sport dama e scacchi uno degli aspetti di cui ogni damista scacchista dovrebbe farsene carico e secondo me un grande pregio che distingue il vero appassionato dal semplice spingitore di pezzi qualunque categoria di gioco esso sia

2347017 la parte reazionaria del discorso del comico lo sfott c una grande differenza fra il teatro sfott e il teatro di satira il teatro di satira sempre morale basti pensare al timore al panico che hanno avuto sempre i potenti davanti ai problemi della satira perch la satira in molti casi ha determinato la presa di coscienza della gente soprattutto delle classi inferiori ha fatto capire di avere il potere di ribaltare le situazioni di avere il coraggio quindi temuta qual la differenza che esiste fra fare satira e fare sfott allora posso dire a un giovane attento che giocare esclusivamente sulla pura caricatura legata a un personaggio anche a un uomo politico che grasso piccolo magro magari ha la gobba magari si intartaglia non realizza niente questo fa fare soltanto una risata fine a se stessa ma se non c la dimensione morale se tu attraverso la satira non riesci a far capire il significato opposto delle banalit dellovvio dellipocrisia soprattutto e della violenza che ogni potere esprime e porta addosso ai minori ebbene il tuo ridere vuoto proprio lo sghignazzo ventrale e non quello dello stomaco e dei polmoni

2347034 however this is the most exciting career opportunity for me both personally and professionally as i begin a new career at cjrw 46 years to the day that my father founded this agency
2347035 cjrw has a long and rich history of developing communications programs that connect and have impact with a given market however this industry is changing as rapidly as ive ever seen it with jay leading our creative talent we intend to continue to create and deliver effective communications and marketing programs that bring success to our clients whether its a product service or an idea jays work has been recognized among the best in the world
2347036 there is too much in the psalm for a thousand pens to write it is one of those all comprehending scriptures which is a bible in itself and it might alone almost suffice for the hymn book of the church
2347037 this is just another sign the market doesnt like buyouts or mergers anymore
2347038 we are delighted that shaklee is one of the first us companies approved under chinas new direct selling regulations and express our gratitude to the chinese government for this opportunity and vote of confidence we are excited about bringing our 50 years of research and development to bring the best natural health products to the chinese people
2347039 we are delighted to be able to provide health and income opportunities to the chinese people we will work hard to ensure that as many chinese consumers as possible will be able to enjoy high quality shaklee products

2347052 theres a million students in the primary schools in peru and every one of them will be getting one of our computers
2347053 the olpc plans to support a dual boot option that would enable children to use either linux or windows on the same machine
2347054 olpc got other companies to look at the commercial possibilities in a much more serious manner
2347055 with a profit driven company the risks taken at olpc wouldnt have been taken
2347056 the high degree of risk taking resulted in a better product for profit companies look at olpc as a crucible of creativity
2347057 were going to sell over a million computers this year which is roughly 250 million in revenue
2347058 thats a pretty amazing statistic if you look at how companies measure their performance
2347059 weve said all were going to say about the olpc project and have no interest in revisiting it
2347060 we applaud all efforts to get pcs and technology into the hands of children in developing markets
2347061 i certainly underestimated the degree to which commercial interests would sabotage a deal or the degree to which olpc would find itself in an amd intel proxy war
2347062 the truth is that those companies see children as a market not a mission
2347063 even if you take a country like rwanda or mongolia salespeople want sales and in the case of intel they do not want amd to get any toehold the result startling in fact is analogous to mcdonalds competing with the world food program
2347064 we can argue about the details but anything that puts computers in the hands of young people in the poorest countries is a positive
2347065 what weve seen over the last couple of years is a significant increase in the number of students who own an apple laptop or apple desktop or plan to buy one
2347066 its a big land grab as far as market share is concerned
2347067 thats what theyre telegraphing when they say margins could be down this quarter and next year they know they have this opportunity in front of them they have the momentum they have the mind share
2347068 from an overall market perspective there are a ton of windows pc vendors that are quaking in their boots over if apple decides to lower its prices

2347084 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2347085 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2347086 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2347087 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2347088 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2347089 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2347090 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2347091 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack

2347103 in the 20th century the evils of soviet communism and nazi fascism were defeated and freedom spread around the world as new democracies emerged

2347132 he was always grinning and goofing around and his smile always had a twinkle

2347166 thats what it means to be a christian not that we should follow christ perfectly but that we should follow him at all it is by virtue of our relationship to christ that we can call ourselves christians and from the very beginning that relationship has meant at least five things

2347173 i accidentally lied to mrs l today so i sat out 5 minutes in recess
2347174 accidentally i didnt mean to i thought she was asking me if somebody else was talking but she was asking me if i was talking and i accidentally lied
2347175 no mrs l didnt know i lied i just knew i lied but it was an accident
2347176 i dont understand why did you sit out in recess
2347177 dear eliot today you went to be with jesus an undeveloped lung a heart with a hole in it and dna that placed faulty information into each and every cell of your body could not stop god from revealing himself through a child who never uttered a word
2347178 the lady had hit a cyclist before she hit our mailbox but nobody had seen the cyclist and the lady had no clue shed hit him she just knew she was sleepy one minute and hit our mailbox the next this biker was just out on his bike and he got hit they pronounced him dead at the scene he died o my gosh i cried and cried my heart not only was crushed for the lady but now for the guy and his family
2347179 empty shell are the words that came to my mind today as i laid my eyes on julians so very still body it made it so real so final i felt like i was at the wax museum it looked like ju but it was just a cold hard wax copy of julian it wasnt him how could it surely i left him at home playing with the boys seeing him laying in his casket was unbelievably painful my heart cracked a little more a little deeper i wont ever get to hold my child again ever nothing is more final than that
2347180 i guess what i really believe is that neighborhoods get reissued you know the community
2347181 its a bunch of folks getting along for some reason something holds them together generally something bad like me and you and kingston hell if we had met at the circus we probably wouldnt even have liked one another but this damned army this idiot war holds us together being miserable seems to hold folks together but when theyre easy and everything is going right they drift apart everybody goes home for a funeral and thats all
2347182 nobody needs nobody when theyre happy but it just happens we dont make it we dont make community any more than we make souls its created
2347183 and you think we were around somewhere else some other time
2347184 maybe as you put it there a neighborhood quiver and the great whoever reaches back and shoots off a dose of community from time to time when one is needed somewhere when it fits his gameplan you know maybe theres only room in the world for just so many communities not souls communities like the lord not only created planets he created communities a solar system and a community system and they go on spinning all in place all where theyre supposed to be and when each one pushing the other away and holding it close at the same time and they go on spinning different times maybe but they go on
2347185 or maybe the difference between a community and a country is that a community has a soul and a country doesnt because god created the community and man created the country some king sees all these communities around and says hoboy lets put em all together and rule over em and then he promptly f s it up

2347266 what they had most in common was a hatred of moral relativism
2347267 they both believed that morality is absolute though they defined and applied it differently but each believed with all his heart brain and soul that there were such things as moral right and moral wrong and that these were not subject to changes in fashion moral relativism was in fact the gravest of sins everything else they believed in common flowed from this basic perception they fought the dictators of course but both knew that the larger battles were yet to come and that victory over the advance scouting parties of soulless uniformity was only a first step what both believed their core who they were was that individual freedom mattered more than anything else on earth and reliance on tradition was the best way to maintain it

2347316 about smoke and mirrors with very little in the way of any real knowledge of or experience in marketing wool
2347317 it does not take into account the years of relationship building that exporters have spent with end users and the investment of millions of dollars working sometimes months ahead to establish forward contracts
2347318 on the day the auction is a snapshot of prices that represents a lot of hard work financial commitment and risk taking
2347319 every farmer thinks he produces the best wool in the world that his wool goes away and is turned into a carpet when its just a component
2347320 at the same time we fund the local industry we pay the farmer 11 days after the hammer falls no matter what happens in the market he always gets his money whether we get ours or not

2347322 it will work with processors throughout the value chain in order to provide fit for purpose product of manufacturing quality in a cost effective way in particular it will target processors operating in the premium end of the market

2347347 if japan bows out we will not have a live population on which to test the bomb
2347348 no one can ignore the terrible power of this weapon
2347349 our entire postwar program depends on terrifying the world with the atomic bomb
2347350 you will need a very good tally i should say a million
2347351 we are hoping for a million tally in japan but if they surrender we wont have anything
2347352 then you have to keep them in the war until the bomb is ready
2347353 keep japan in the war another three months and we can use the bomb on their cities we will end this war with the naked fear of all the peoples of the world who will then bow to our will
2347354 baruch was especially interested in oppenheimer for the position of senior scientific adviser
2347355 the most notorious war criminal of the second world war
2347356 was selected by the heads of the atomic bomb project as sole writer and public relations
2347357 we brought them down to an abject surrender through the accelerated sinking of their merchant marine and hunger alone and when we didnt need to do it and knew we didnt need to do it we used them as an experiment for two atomic bombs
2347358 byrnes spoke with the authority of personally represented the president of the united states on all bomb related matters in the interim committees deliberations
2347359 truman didnt know his own secretary of state stettinius he had no background in foreign policy no expert advisors of his own
2347360 truman was moving in quite the opposite direction largely under the influence of byrnes the atom bomb for byrnes was an instrument of diplomacy atomic diplomacy
2347361 it was strange to us that hiroshima had never been bombed despite the fact that b 29 bombers flew over the city every day only after the war did i come to know that hiroshima according to american archives had been kept untouched in order to preserve it as a target for the use of nuclear weapons perhaps if the american administration and its military authorities had paid sufficient regard to the terrible nature of the fiery demon which mankind had discovered and yet knew so little about its consequences the american authorities might never have used such a weapon against the 750 000 japanese who ultimately became its victims
2347362 my eyes were ready to overflow with tears i spoke to myself and bit my lip so that i would not cry if i had cried i would have lost my courage to keep standing and working treating dying victims of hiroshima
2347363 from the instant the atomic bomb exploded it became the symbol of all human evil it was a savagely primitive demon and most modern curse my nightmare stems from a suspicion that a certain trust in human strength or humanism flashed across the minds of american intellectuals who decided upon the project that concluded with the dropping of the bomb on hiroshima
2347364 one of the myths of hiroshima is that the inhabitants were warned by leaflets that an atomic bomb would be dropped the leaflets leonard nadler and william p jones recall seeing in the hiroshima museum in 1960 and 1970 were dropped after the bombing this happened because the presidents interim committee on the atomic bomb decided on may 31 that we could not give the japanese any warning furthermore the decision to drop atomic leaflets on japanese cities was not made until august 7 the day after the hiroshima bombing they were not dropped until august 10 after nagasaki had been bombed we can say that the residents of hiroshima received no advance warning about the use of the atomic bomb on june 1 1945 a formal and official decision was taken during a meeting of the so called interim committee not to warn the populations of the specific target cities james byrnes and oppenheimer insisted that the bombs must be used without prior warning
2347365 closely linked to the question of whether a warning of an atomic bomb attack was given to the civilian populations of the target cities is the third article of fifth that underpins the american legend of hiroshima the belief that hiroshima and nagasaki were military targets the headquarters of the japanese second army were located in hiroshima and approximately 20 000 men of which about half or 10 000 died in the attack in nagasaki there were about 150 deaths among military personnel in the city thus between the two cities 4 4 of the total death toll was made up of military personnel in short more than 95 of the casualties were civilians
2347366 in 1945 i had ordered the atomic bomb dropped on japan at two places devoted almost exclusively to war production
2347367 the manhattan projects managers were lobbying to use the atomic bomb byrnes sat in on these meetings maj gen groves seems to have been the author of the claim that the use of the bomb would save a million american lives a figure in the realm of fantasy
2347368 the japanese are still continuing their propaganda aimed at creating the impression we won the war unfairly and thus attempting to create sympathy for themselves
2347369 the legation of switzerland on august 11 1945 forwarded from tokyo the following memorandum to the state department which sat on it for twenty five years before finally releasing it the legation of switzerland has received a communication from the japanese government on august 6 1945 american airplanes released on the residential district of the town of hiroshima bombs of a new type killing and injuring in one second a large number of civilians and destroying a great part of the town not only is the city of hiroshima a provincial town without any protection or special military installations of any kind but also none of the neighboring regions or towns constitutes a military objective
2347370 the claim that an invasion of the japanese home islands was necessary without the use of the atomic bombs is untrue the claim that an atomic warning was given to the populace of hiroshima is untrue and the claim that both cities were key military targets is untrue
2347371 as part of the hiroshima atomic battle plan my b 29 named jabbitt iii captain john abbott wilsons third war plane flew the weather observation mission over the secondary target of kokura on august 6 1945
2347372 after the first bomb was dropped the atom bomb command was very fearful that japan might surrender before we could drop the second bomb so our people worked around the clock 24 hours a day to avoid such a misfortune
2347373 in city after city all over the face of japan except for our cities spared because reserved for atomic holocaust they ignited the most terrible firestorms in history with very light losses of b 29s sometimes the heat from these firestorms was so intense that later waves of b 29s were caught by updrafts strong enough to loft them upwards from 4 or 5 000 feet all the way up to 8 or 10 000 feet the major told us that the fire bombing of japan had proven successful far beyond anything they had imagined possible and that the 20th air force was running out of cities to burn already there were no longer as of the first week in june 1945 any target cities left that were worth the attention of more than 50 b 29s and on a big day we could send up as many as 450 planes
2347374 the totality of the devastation in japan was extraordinary and this was matched by the near totality of japans defencelessness
2347375 the truman government censored and controlled all the war information that was allowed to reach the public and of course truman had a vested interest in obscuring the truth so as to surreptitiously prolong the war and be politically able to use the atom bomb
2347376 a large part of the japanese navy was already on the bottom of the sea the combined navy surface and air force action even by this time had forced japan into a position that made her early surrender inevitable none of us then knew the potentialities of the atomic bomb but it was my opinion and i urged it strongly on the joint chiefs that no major land invasion of the japanese mainland was necessary to win the war the jcs did order the preparation of plans for an invasion but the invasion itself was never authorized
2347377 the monstrous truth is that the timing of the okinawa campaign was exclusively related to the early august timetable of the atomic bomb jaccuse i accuse presidents franklin roosevelt and harry truman of deliberately committing war crimes against the american people for the sole purpose of helping set the stage for the criminally unnecessary use of atomic weapons on japan
2347378 it is my opinion that the use of this barbarous weapon at hiroshima and nagaski was of no material assistance in our war against japan the japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender because of the effective sea blockade and the successful bombing with conventional weapons
2347379 trumans wanton use of atomic weapons left the american people feeling dramatically less secure after winning world war ii than they had ever felt before and these feelings of insecurity have been exploited by unscrupulous cold war machine politicians ever since
2347380 my own feeling is that being the first to use it the atomic bomb we had adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarism of the dark ages i was not taught to make war in that fashion and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children
2347381 on may 5 may 12 and june 7 the office of strategic services our intelligence operation reported japan was considering capitulation further messages came on may 18 july 7 july 13 and july 16
2347382 the standing united states demand for unconditional surrender directly threatened not only the person of the emperor but such central tenets of japanese culture as well
2347383 the war would have been over in two weeks without the russians entering and without the atomic bomb press inquiry you mean that sir without the russians and without the atomic bomb lemay the atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all
2347384 the roof and masonry of the catholic cathedral fell on the kneeling worshippers all of them died
2347385 the hiroshima and nagasaki atomic bombs did not defeat japan nor by the testimony of the enemy leaders who ended the war did they persuade japan to accept unconditional surrender the emperor the lord privy seal the prime minister the foreign minister and the navy minister had decided as early as may 1945 that the war should be ended even if it meant acceptance of defeat on allied terms it is the surveys opinion that certainly prior to december 1 1945 and in all probability prior to november 1 1945 japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2347386 the surprise bombings of hiroshima and nagasaki are morally indefensible
2347387 i would call it a crime were it not that the word crime implies sin and sin requires a consciousness of guilt the action taken by the untied states government was in defiance of every sentiment and every conviction upon which our civilization is based
2347388 military necessity will be our constant cry in answer to criticism but it will never erase from our minds the simple truth that we of all civilized nations though hesitating to use poison gas did not hesitate to employ the most destructive weapon of all times indiscriminately against men women and children
2347389 the united states should be the first to condemn the atomic bomb and apologize for its use against japan spokesmen for the army air forces said it wasnt necessary and that the war had been won already competent testimony exists to prove that japan was seeking to surrender many weeks before the atomic bomb came
2347390 the truth is we are guilty our conscience as a nation must trouble us we must confess our sin we have used a horrible weapon to asphyxiate and cremate more than 100 000 men women and children in a sort of super lethal gas chamber and all this in a war already won or which spokesman for our air forces tell us we could have readily won without the atomic bomb we ought therefore to apologize in unequivocal terms at once to the whole world for our misuse of the atomic bomb
2347391 ike would never lose his scepticism of the weapon and later referred to it as a hellish contrivance
2347392 our employment of this new force at hiroshima and nagasaki was a supreme provocation to other nations especially the soviet union moreover its use violated the normal standards of warfare by wiping out entire populations mostly civilians in the target cities certainly what happened at hiroshima and nagasaki will forever be on the conscience of the american people
2347393 the phrase atoms for peace entered the lexicon of international affairs with a speech by eisenhower before the united nations december 8 1953
2347394 in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the miliary industrial complex the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist
2347395 in 1957 he lashed out at large pentagon budgets our government has kept us in a perpetual state of fear kept us in a continuous stampede of patriotic fervor with the cry of grave national emergency always there has been some terrible evil to gobble us up if we did not blindly rally behind it by furnishing the exorbitant funds demanded yet in retrospect these disasters seem never to have happened seem never to have been quite real
2347396 back in the united states the news of the bombing of hiroshima was greeted with a mixture of relief pride joy shock and sadness
2347397 like a prizefighter clasping his hands together above his head as he came to the podium
2347398 possessed substantial defects of character and imprudent dangerous associations with known subversives
2347399 professor einstein told me that he saw the rebirth of israel as one of the few political acts in his lifetime which had an essential moral quality he believed that the conscience of the world should therefore be involved in israels preservation
2347400 a continuing program of scientific study and research on the broad subject of air warfare with the object of recommending to the air force preferred methods of techniques and instrumentalities for this purpose
2347401 in july 1996 the world court took a stand in its first formal opinion on the legality of nuclear weapons two years earlier the united nations had asked the court for an advisory opinion the general assembly of the united nations posed a single yet profoundly basic question for consideration it the threat of use of nuclear weapons on any circumstances permitted under international law for the first time the worlds pre eminent judicial authority has considered the question of criminality vis a vis the use of a nuclear weapon and in doing so it has come to the conclusion that the use of a nuclear weapon is unlawful it is also the courts view that even the threat of the use of a nuclear weapon is illegal although there were differences concerning the implications of the right of self defense provided by article 51 of the u n charter ten of the fourteen judges hearing the case found the use of threat to use a nuclear weapon to be illegal on the basis of the existing canon of humanitarian law which governs the conduct of armed conflict the judges based their opinion on more than a century of treatise and conventions that are collectively known as the hague and geneva laws
2347402 the atomic bomb has deadened the finest feelings which have sustained mankind for ages there used to be so called laws of war which made it tolerable now we understand the naked truth war knows no law except that of might the atomic bomb brought an empty victory to the allied armies it has resulted for the time being in the soul of japan being destroyed what has happened to the soul of the destroying nation is yet too early to see truth needs to be repeated as long as there are men who do not believe it
2347403 in 1945 i had ordered the atomic bomb dropped on japan at two places devoted almost exclusively to war production
2347404 the city of hiroshima is a provincial town without any protection or military installations of any kind but also none of the neighboring regions or towns constitutes a military objective
2347405 the hiroshima and nagasaki bombs did not defeat japan nor by the testimony of the enemy leaders who ended the war did they persuade japan to accept unconditional surrender the emperor the lord privy seal the prime minister the foreign minister and the navy minister had decided as early as may 1945 that the war should be ended even if it meant acceptance of defeat on allied terms it is the surveys opinion that certainly prior to december 1 1945 and in all probability prior to november 1 1945 japan would have surrendered even if the atomic bombs had not been dropped and even if no invasion had been planned or contemplated
2347406 the truth is we are guilty our conscience as a nation must trouble us we must confess our sin we have used a horrible weapon to asphyxiate and cremate more than 100 000 men women and children in a sort of super lethal gas chamber and all this in a war already won or which spokesman for our air forces tell us we could have readily won without the atomic bomb
2347407 the atomic bomb has deadened the finest feelings which have sustained mankind for ages there used to be so called laws of war which made it tolerable now we understand the naked truth war knows no law except that of might the atomic bomb brought an empty victory to the allied armies it has resulted for the time being in the soul of japan being destroyed what has happened to the soul of the destroying nation is yet too early to see
2347408 international humanitarian law is applicable to international armed conflicts the international law of peace existing between the states concerned will thus be large superseded by the rules of international humanitarian law a state can not therefore be allowed to invoke military necessity as a justification for upsetting that balance by departing from those rules
2347409 in war a belligerent many apply only that amount and kind of force necessary to defeat the enemy acts of war are only permissible if they are directed against military objectives if they are not likely to cause unnecessary suffering and if they are not perfidious
2347410 the obligation of the parties to the conflict to at all times distinguish between the civilian population and combatants
2347411 an attack by bombardment by any method or means which treats as a single military objective a number of clearly separated and distinct military objectives located in a city town village or other area containing a similar concentration of civilians or civilian objects
2347412 an attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life injury to civilians damage to civilian objects or a combination thereof which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated article 51 protection of the civilian population paragraph 5 b
2347413 protection of civilians from arbitrary and oppressive enemy action outlined in 1899 and later in 1907 was expressed in its most complete form in the fourth geneva convention of 1949 which is now supplemented by this protocol

2347575 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2347576 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2347577 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2347578 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2347579 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2347580 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2347581 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2347582 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2347583 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2347584 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2347585 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2347586 the standards which the commission applied exceed the very limited scope of this courts tolerance for regulation
2347587 online content publishing strategy long vs short articles whats better
2347588 is that a hound i hear baying in the moor

2347590 stay close to the vorlon and watch for the shadows they move when youre not looking at them
2347591 the number one reason was because we believe he can help our hockey club and we felt strongly that we missed him last year
2347592 we missed his leadership and his play and his coolness
2347593 he wanted to come back and we wanted him back
2347594 and you obviously dont want to enter into a new contract without resolving the past so we did that
2347595 we have a religion in utah mormonism and we dont need no other damn religion
2347596 i think i can say this but that will alienate too many
2347597 his dependence on sleight of hand will be his undoing in the general election joe lunchbox knows what hes likely to do
2347598 its like being caught between a rock amp a hard place
2347599 how is london going to match this and at same time whats any of this got to do with sport
2347600 the night was soaked in the sort of nightmarish weirdness that most of us only experience after eating too much soft cheese late at night
2347601 it has been our policy to provide the media with convenient and sufficient access to the internet
2347602 i believe our policy will not affect reporters coverage of the olympic games
2347603 president bush is on a week long tour of asia hell visit south korea thailand and china or as the white house calls it the everything sold at wal mart tour
2347604 now to highlight what a charade proper air pressure is the mccain campaign has started handing out barack obama energy plan tire gauges you see its a great way to drive home what a ridiculous plan this is plus its an easy way to check your tire pressure and that can save you a lot of money thats not just me talking the governments own website says that proper tire inflation can save up to 12 cents a gallon immediately so thank you for the tire gauge senator mccain and good work you stuck it to all the left wing nutjobs who advocate proper tire inflation radical liberals like your potential vice presidential nominee florida governor charlie crist arnold schwarzenegger joe lieberman triple a and the pinkos over at nascar ive had my eyes on those guys ever since they had that car sponsored by the aclu
2347605 security is very tight for the olympics in china which has been very hard on the locals there many stores and factories in beijing have been forced to close and people have been forced out of their houses sort of like here in the united states only for them it ends in a couple of weeks
2347606 theres excitement in the air over the olympics also lead arsenic benzene
2347607 the skies over beijing are very smoggy the government says the pollution is just a harmless mist they made a similar statement about the treatment of prisoners its not torture its pilates
2347608 it ought to be the struggle against ideological extremists who do not believe in free societies who happen to use terror as a weapon to try to shake the conscience of the free world
2347609 i i ive ill i mine me i was jogging one day and i happened to run into this guy and he was telling me about this new company i have an assistant
2347610 what he did was wicked in the lords sight so he put him to death also
2347611 obviously i think thats great for galvestonians because had those two proposals passed i believe it would have been devastating to the citys operations
2347612 hopefully the public got educated on the effects of the things
2347613 i can only speculate but my opinion is that if he had the signatures he would have gone forward with it
2347614 were just extremely ecstatic that chief washington is going back to his job as he should be
2347615 we thought the whole thing was ridiculous from the beginning and the truth finally came out
2347616 were glad its over and were hopeful the community can heal and move on
2347617 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2347618 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2347619 james will fit in with their system shes always wanted to be in the sec
2347620 i cant play point guard in a system that doesnt allow a scoring point guard but coach landers does

2347628 i wanted to pet him but he didnt let me pet him at first so i chased him
2347629 the head is insolated and keeps all the heat in moving around really takes practice
2347630 i liked when he came over to me cause i wanted him to
2347631 he felt fuzzy his brother liked the colors and the drum beat that accompanied the dancers
2347632 i liked the movement and the music and how they had harmony with each other
2347633 the lion came over and shook his butt his fur was really soft like feathers
2347634 i just got a taste of the culture it was amazing

2347639 the market is in the right direction underpinned by a downturn in the oil price but there is still a lot of nervousness
2347640 we are broadly speaking at the end of the half yearly results season for the banks which have not been particularly good in terms of the actual numbers but they have at least exceeded expectations
2347641 je me pose la question peut tre une question qui na pas de sens de savoir si un embryon ou un f tus qui se sent sans arr t sur un si ge jectable en fonction de ce que va dire l chographie en fonction de ce que vont dire les examens ne serait pas en train de construire une humanit future extr mement angoiss e

2347643 this was not a mutual mistake by financial services companies this was a deliberate effort to ensnare consumers with great damage
2347644 there is growing concern about the euro zone economic backdrop for so long the focus has been on the fed and the dollar and the euro has been the default beneficiary
2347645 the concern is there and sterling has gone down hand in hand with euro dollar
2347646 our research shows that over a third of people privately renting are doing so because they cant get a mortgage at the moment
2347647 on the surface of it this looks like the rental market should be buoyant but if you consider that many of those renting may be struggling to make ends meet it is certainly not all good news for buy to let owners
2347648 however with new developments in europe being delayed and new regulations limiting land sales in china this sector may soon experience the same declining investment other property types have
2347649 the bank will say that downside risks to growth have materialised but the report will not tip the balance either way as the outlook for inflation is very uncertain

2347668 we worked on some with a company that was developing the technology a few years ago to convert films into 3 d we worked with them but the system works great its just not very practical so what weve been working on since then is to develop a sort of practical way to do it and we will get there its just a technological challenge
2347669 financial support and needs for the rest of her life
2347670 everything weve done has been the result of long periods of unemployment followed by the ability to get all the stuff made that we wrote when no one would make it
2347671 the chronology of this windstorm of projects is we were working on undeclared and seth and evan goldberg rogens writing partner were writing superbad in their native land of canada and no one would make that and i said hey i got this idea for a stoner action movie pineapple express
2347672 and we kicked it around and started to make it and realized well maybe thats actually less commercial than superbad and so we said okay lets start on drillbit taylor and we started writing things and eventually they happened
2347673 i wanted to remind myself of the terror and the diarrhea
2347674 and its all a part of it because i have to write jokes for them
2347675 adam is somebody who hasnt done the type of movie we do and thats whats exciting and really fresh to find out what the morph is
2347676 weve worked with judd since anchor man and its been a positive experience but we mckay and ferrell have our own style if you look at his movies theyre nothing like ours ours are aggressive and larger and a little more absurd youd never confuse it with knocked up but hes such fan of comedy hes able to give notes on absurd large comedies
2347677 i dont have any regrets about producing so much these movies would be my favourite movies of all time even if i had no part in them these are this generations classic comedies we hope
2347678 yknow i was watching mad men the other day my new favourite show and it was the first time i felt really bad about not working in tv because obviously its really fun to work with the same writers and actors and directors for a long time and tell a continuing story

2347976 mobile satellite services have the tremendous advantage of being able to cover most of the eus territory thereby reaching millions of eu citizens across borders they represent an unprecedented opportunity for all europeans to access new communication services and this not only in metropolitan areas but also in rural and less populated regions
2347977 however these satellite services depend on substantial investment and therefore need simple and swift procedures as well as long term legal certainty this is why the commission in close cooperation with the european parliament and the council of ministers set up in a record time of only ten months a single eu procedure for selecting interested operators of mobile satellite services there is now one market not 27 in europe for mobile satellite services henceforth the ball is in the camp of the industry i expect intense competition among operators offering satellite based communication services reaching consumers from the north of sweden to the south of spain this could pave the way for first satellite launches already in the course of 2009

2348021 the transcontinental railroad was to the real estate of inland america as itunes is to the music marketplace of today

2348024 hollywood believes large scale broadband video distribution would only destroy proven value fail to provide alternative value and alter a business model that is still far from being in decline with near total control of the most valuable program libraries and the business models governing their distribution a shift towards broadband media will come largely on hollywoods terms and at an incremental pace
2348025 although 180solutions has come to realize that third party distribution can be hard to police we believe it is possible to properly balance who we do business with while providing monetization methods for the long tail of web publishers and content developers
2348026 the advertisers benefit by repeat display of the name of their products google benefits because it does gets paid for the occasional click the cost is my inventory of space not googles so every click is gravy to google and every exposure is value to the advertiser in effect google is giving away exposures on my blog so that they can sell a few clicks which they will dutifully pay me for
2348027 when i came to this slide during my presentation in san jose i asked the audience how many were familiar with the long tail concept practically no one was yesterday the same thing happened with my chicago audience of about 300 people maybe 10 percent of the hands went up when i asked how many knew about the long tail
2348028 as the data indicates recommendation tools can provide important stimuli for increasing the diversity of music from genres to artists to which consumers are exposed recommendation tools can be a crucial component in driving demand for back catalogs as a source of high margin revenue for rights holders as well as toward niche artists and music that they otherwise would
2348029 on november 13 2005 google announced google analytics a free web analytics service targeted at the long tail of small and medium size businesses that lack a web analytics solution
2348030 the real issue for the studios is how they can dig into this potential gold mine without undermining their existing revenue streams
2348031 la times on the end of the mass moviegoing era
2348032 the era of moviegoing as a mass audience ritual is slowly but inexorably drawing to a close eroded by many of the same forces that have eviscerated the music industry decimated network tv and yes are clobbering the newspaper business put simply an explosion of new technology the internet dvds video games downloading cellphones and ipods now offers more compelling diversion than 90 of the movies in theaters
2348033 it is difficult to satisfy the diversity of demand without having to resort to client server architectures and specialized network protocols we solve this by creating an incentive mechanism that ensures the existence of a diverse set of offerings regardless of content and size while the system delivers favorite mainstream content it can also provide files that constitute small niche markets which only in the aggregate can generate large revenues
2348034 bollywood tv says it has the internet rights to more than 730 indian films though at any one time on its site i have not seen more than 100 movies
2348035 1 every dollar coming out of print advertising revenue for newspapers is replaced by only 33 cents online 2 the largest 50 web companies are attracting 96 of the ad spending on line according to pricewaterhouse coopers with the majority going to aol google msn and yahoo
2348036 meanwhile the most energetic original and positive writing has been migrating to the web and to blogs no surprise here anybody who creates a blog is a an entrepreneur and thus probably not a zero sum thinker b a producer first and a consumer second these two attributes alone guarantee that the blogger probably has a more accurate view of the world and how it really works than does the zero sum thinker toiling away at his mainstream media position
2348037 historically blockbuster has reported that about 90 of the movies they rent are new theatrical releases they do a great job of fulfilling demand created by the studios who spend 4 billion per year marketing new theatrical releases now they have a slightly different mix online a couple of quarters ago they said that about 70 of what they rent online is new releases and about 30 is back catalog thats not true in our business and its never been true in our business the day we came public and in the most recent quarter about 30 of what we rent is new releases and about 70 is back catalog and its not because we have a different subscriber its because we create demand for content and we help you find great movies that youll really like we do it algorithmically and we do it with recommendations and ratings
2348038 search engines have the effect of counteracting the skewed distribution of links in the web directing some traffic toward sites that users would never visit otherwise
2348039 lets say that joss whedon creator of firefly wanted to bring the series back to air
2348040 the big companies have mostly finished their erp and crm implementations which is why oracle has been on a buying binge the action today is in small and medium sized businesses smbs from a service producers point of view how can we service smbs profitably on fairly short engagements with 1 or a few consultants and from the smbs point of view how can they add the it talent that they dont have in house in the short small doses when they need it
2348041 the best explanation for the leveling off of midlist book sales in the 1990s is in the rise of the superstores and other large chain booksellers chain store merchandising policies help turn consumers attention away from midlist titles and toward an elite of books that are backed by heavy marketing budgets independent bookstores hand sell favorite books to their customers whereas chain retailers often charge publishers for favorable placement in stores inclusion in ads and other support publishers marketing budgets for midlist titles usually include less than 5 000 to cover the total cost of advertising book tours and other promotions but just to get a book put on a table at the front of the store in one of the chains can cost 10 000
2348042 in most cases nearly half of a movies total audience turns out in the first week of release which means there has been very little or no word of mouth motivating most of the audience in other words many people go to a movie without any real information about it without even reading a review or put most cynically most of the time there is no relationship between how good a film is and how many people turn out to see it
2348043 indie films are typically made before they have u s distribution and with independent financing therefore the producer does not know when if ever the film will be released in theaters so unlike studio films independent films cannot be conceptually geared to a marketing campaign or used to recruit merchandising tie ins independent producers therefore have only a singular product the movie itself to find a distributor they often have to show their movies at film festival after film festival at that point if the film is to succeed it must create its own audience through reviews awards and word of mouth so while studio films are rushed through postproduction editing to meet their release schedule an independent producer must keep re editing a film no matter how long it takes until the film works perfectly as a result independent films win much of the glory and awards and studio films win most of the gold taking in well over 80 percent of the box office proceeds
2348044 at a time when audiences are ebbing piracy is threatening profits and at home downloading takes gas mileage out of the movie going equation a company that helps filmmakers and audiences find each other on the internet may be as natural a step in the evolution of cinema as portable dvd players or reserved seats it may also be as close to a no risk deal as filmmakers are likely to find all they need provide is proof that the rights to their film have been cleared and a master to be copied and unlike traditional or even online distribution deals the filmmakers retain all the rights
2348045 google print is a killer example of an edge competence based strategy like core competences in the 80s and 90s edge competences are going to dominate the post network economy of the 21st century by making info about books more liquid and plastic google atomizes upstream and downstream segments in the value chains for example it dilutes amazons market power directly by massively reducing switching costs and in general the market power of anyone on either side of its value chain segment value shifts away from the core and towards the edges
2348046 the majority of revenue in search is still made in popular searches rather than the tail in fact over 70 of search revenue is made on just 30 of the searches this shows both the stiff competition that exists for popular keywords and the upside that still exists for paid search as that competition spreads to the tail
2348047 three weeks ago sheffields arctic monkeys entered the uk charts at number one with their second single i bet you look good on the dancefloor they had just played their second london gig before an audience of 3 000 even by the hyper speed standards of modern rock and pop this was a remarkable rise apparently made possible only because the band had posted their songs on their website and thus built up a vast virtual fanbase before even securing a record deal
2348048 in the latest sign that the rules of television are being turned on their head the two divisions of time warner inc
2348049 but within their niche they dominate a site that ranks as number 100 000 in the overall web universe would still be the fifth largest within its niche big enough to throw some weight around furthermore niches have their own niches focusing on a highly targeted subtopic can make even a tiny site with a few hundred thousand page views stand out
2348050 the business is made much more complex by windows and audiences that are fragmenting
2348051 the story for the next 10 years is how content is going to adapt you wont find your audience in any one place anymore
2348052 allow people to buy stuff the way they want to so that you can wring every last cent out of your content by earning 1 from someone who isnt willing to spend 10 for the entire book perhaps someone will shortly suggest a subscription model for online books sign up for a membership plan and get to read as many books as you want or a specified monthly quota on your computer but without being able to download or print the books probably too easily hackable but much more appealing to me because it means having a potentially huge number of books available for actual reading on your desktop without even having to trudge down to the library
2348053 the executives at dmg still seem to be in the process of choosing a business model last year the company said it planned to beef up hiring so it could sign promote and market undiscovered artists in may it abruptly shifted gears laying off seven of its 15 workers and decided to focus on buying the rights of golden oldies also in the second quarter the company took a 75 000 writedown for a non recoverable advance it made to an unnamed recording artist
2348054 in 1976 punk broke onto the music scene and changed the rules of music music was democratized you didnt even need to be able to sing or know how to play music you just needed a guitar now blogging is having the same impact on publishing of course a lot of rubbish gets produced but some great gems get created too that wouldnt have normally been produced under the old system this is the era of punk publishing look around the blogosphere can you spot the sex pistols or the clash can you see a great entrepreneur like the one we got from that era richard branson
2348055 the obscure articles edited by a few authors that know about the subject are honestly some of the best in wikipedia i think as long as they are not about anything controversial usually they arent though or they would have more editors
2348056 i am wallowing in composers and works that i had never heard of svendsen vieuxtemps pitfield grieg other than the great piano concerto
2348057 the xbox which focuses on highly mature genres catering to hardcore gamers has production costs of 1 82 million a title the gamecube costs half as much at 822 000 a title the real kicker is that the nintendo ds only costs 338 286 a title to develop for even less than the gameboy some of these costs have to do with the hardware and development kits but for the most part they are derived from the scope of the projects being able to develop successful titles at 1 5th the cost of your competitors is a major boost to your bottom line
2348058 a great analogy to describe the potential impact of the long tail in book search is to consider the rapid rise of consumer created content online including blogs message boards ratings sites and other forms of social media these platforms are becoming incredibly influential not just because of their sheer popularity and compelling content but because they represent a massively growing share of online content relative to all other such as corporate commercial editorial and government content these more niche social media tend to place very prominently in search engines and therefore can achieve otherwise disproportionate exposure anyone responsible for the reputation of a big corporate brand is often kept up at night by that fact the little guys voice is being heard like never before loud and clear

2348066 why is there such a long tail of programming languages in the community and is there an efficient way to satisfy the obvious need for more niche languages and promote the language innovation that happens in the long tail the first question is pretty easy to answer there is a long tail because the more specialized a language is to a domain the better it fits to solve problems for that domain these niche languages trade off generality for efficiency in a domain and they are simply better and more efficient tools for that domain the second question is a bit harder
2348067 bridging the digital divide is all about serving the longest tail by driving down price and driving up access and interoperability what is happening in massachusetts is the beginning of a global realization that governments have a productive obligation to serve the longest tail their citizenry by deploying open accessible standards not the technology of a single company

2348076 new communication technologies and the lowered cost of participation they created allowed the linux movement to effectively harness a large and diverse wealth of programming power that would otherwise have been unavailable to it
2348077 a true long tail business is one that copes with the ultimate niches where there are just one or even zero customers you need to be sure that your submission model can cope with these limiting cases and not choke especially as you do not know a priori which ones are going to garner customers so what businesses fit this model the obvious one is ebay omidyars model of a perfect marketplace is tuned so that it is stable if you dont find a buyer ebay takes a small listing fee but works better if you do ebay takes a percentage another example is cafepress they dont even set a listing fee working on the assumption that the effort to build a product list is enough of a hurdle and have prices set so that a production run of one item is cost effective for them they aggregate sales and pay monthly

2348079 the complexity of the threat posed by open source warfare in iraq has accelerated the us militarys use of outsourcing traditionally the long tail has been used to describe the number of support personnel the tail required to support combat troops the tooth tooth to tail ratios have grown over the years as the complexity and resource intensity of modern combat has increased in essence modern warfare requires a loooong tail of support troops the us militarys tooth to tail ratio is approximately 1 to 10 or more
2348080 as in other domains this move towards distributed creation and production is being driven by more affordable and accessible tools of production the backwoods meth producer is a direct descendant of the backwoods hootch producer during the prohibition we may not like what they are producing but history has shown they will be quite creative in finding ways to produce it themselves the mit fab lab participant the remix dj at the local hip nightclub the extreme sports enthusiast and the backwoods meth producer all share a common passion producing goods and experiences on their own terms
2348081 consider postal service fulfillment of transactions made on the internet about two million prescriptions a day roughly one fifth of the total are delivered by first class mail ebays vendors list five million new items daily and those that are sold ship mainly by mail one pitney bowes study found that online retailers were increasingly using paper catalogs sent through the mail to steer people to their sites
2348082 some tracks will dip as low at 39 pence 72 cents halving itunes and virgin price points as part of the hmv plan developing artist tracks and deeper catalog will carry the lower price points while premium songs will carry higher tags in the end hmv will buck the uniform pricing approach popularized by itunes a result that major labels have been pushing for

2348085 to me this shows another crack in the traditional producer distribution audience models it is obvious that scholars and professionals were not the audience the two beethoven enthusiasts were first doing what they wanted to enjoy and couldnt find and now they are hoping to reach the mainstream in a way academicians and virtuosos cant as doc searls points out this is the demand side supplying itself
2348086 urban theorist jane jacobs observed many years ago that paradoxically huge cities create environments where small niches can flourish a store selling nothing but buttons most likely wont be able to find a market in a town of 50 000 people but in new york city theres an entire button store district subcultures thrive in big cities for this reason as well if you have idiosyncratic tastes youre much more likely to find someone who shares those tastes in a city of 9 million people
2348087 netflix makes it harder and harder for a customer to consider leaving the system for a competitor the more the user sees benefit from participation the more they give the more they give the less likely they are to leave even if there was a way to take your data to another service the system builds loyalty to the brand and the user experience that theyve spent time and energy learning

2348089 in a world in which consumers can increasingly access precisely what they want on the device and in the location they chose for the price they want to pay the ability to use repackage and market content to meet users higher customization personalization and functionality standards gets you a lucrative seat at the big table but playing that game means changing relationships at every level of the media and entertainment supply and demand food chain from content distributors providers and producers as well as advertisers and marketers
2348090 in this new world of choice and control at the edges its the niches and those who can pull them together who win besides a universal top n00 list is even a bad execution of big media think when ad age gives you lists of magazine revenue it separates womens and entertainment and business publications in big media those pass as niches and they are far more valuable comparisons when talking about newspapers you dont lump in metro papers with town papers with trade papers its a meaningless lump when somebody can tell me who the queen of the knitting bloggers is then ill listen and so will knitting advertisers

2348162 while most bumiputeras who were given shares and opportunities to do business abused these opportunities a few tried seriously and some of them succeeded obviously these would be the people who should get more opportunities those who had abused their rights were also given second and third chances but as they continued to mess up their contracts and projects they were dropped out giving them more opportunities would simply be a waste it would not help correct the economic imbalances
2348163 referring to bumiputera businessmen who had continued to receive contracts and opportunities and would pass these contracts down to their non bumi counterparts for execution many of these businessmen were given more than just second or third chances
2348164 admittedly some of them failed and were dropped the numbers who succeeded became smaller as we cannot risk giving to failures the few successful people seem to be getting all the government contracts privatisation projects and other business opportunities

2348184 this has been the iranian strategy for years to bide their time and continue with their enrichment
2348185 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2348186 i was and am ashamed of my conduct and choices
2348187 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2348188 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2348189 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2348192 thousands of friends of the senators and his supporters have put their faith and confidence in him and hes let them down
2348193 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2348194 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2348195 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2348196 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it
2348197 my address wasnt published and i only lived there a short while before carl and i got married and moved out of state
2348198 no one knew my address or my phone number you had to stalk me to figure this stuff out
2348199 i had no idea he lived anywhere in the vicinity i wonder if its possible that ivins moved to that location to be close to nancy
2348200 i said this happened and im sure youre the one who did it and he denied it
2348201 and i said well im still sure you did what can you do at that point
2348202 he seemed to know a lot about myself my children things i never remembered telling him which always disturbed me
2348203 i kept him at arms length as best i could
2348204 after a while after i decided that he was probably the perpetrator i was afraid of him
2348205 i thought that if he found out i had turned him in he would go after me and he knew how to do that this is something his colleagues dont seem to recognize in him
2348206 we already had firsthand experience with him going back and forth
2348207 i praise you because i am fearfully and wonderfully made your works are wonderful i know that full well
2348208 just do whatever jesus calls you to do the moment it is clear to you do not procrastinate do not hesitate do not deviate from whatever course of action he calls you to but i want to warn you the closer you walk with christ the greater the faith required the more you trust him the more youll risk on his behalf the more you love him the more you will love others if you genuinely embrace his sacrifice you will joyfully embrace a sacrificial life your expectations of jesus will change as your intimacy with him deepens

2348210 the calvo family members were the apparent victims of a local drug ring
2348211 i called him to express my sorrow and regret for that and for the loss of the familys beloved dogs

2348231 but my mother who was a simple housewife she showed me the snake when i was a child
2348232 how dare this man come in here and name a snake after his wife

2348245 this is a glorious but also huge task for anyone

2348277 i havent signed a contract to build a home for someone in 11 months
2348278 i look through the parade of homes magazine and chuckle

2348289 whatever you can do or dream you can begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it begin it now
2348290 the only people who get anywhere interesting are the people who get lost
2348291 and the day came when it was more painful to remain tight in a bud than the risk it took to blossom

2348295 at the critical juncture in all human relationships there is only one question what would love do now
2348296 success in life is a matter not so much of talent or opportunity as of concentration and perseverance
2348297 the road to success is not to be run upon by seven leagued boots step by step little by little bit by bit that is the way to wealth that is the way to wisdom that is the way to glory pounds are the sons not of pounds but of pence
2348298 in the private sanctuary of ones own conscience lies that spirit that determination to cast off the old person and to measure up to the stature of true potential
2348299 it is never too late to be what you might have been
2348300 you are here to enrich the world and you impoverish yourself if you forget that errand
2348301 it had long since come to my attention that people of accomplishment rarely sat back and let things happen to them they went out and happened to things

2348325 i mean everybody comes and they want to yell and scream and have their opportunity and i think thats all to the good because then you know everybody can go ok great

2348396 its expensive its complicated and its slow its amazing that weve generated as much revenue as we have given how cumbersome the experience can be
2348397 physical distribution of physical goods that consumers pay for at retail

2348400 earnings estimate revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices
2348401 i cant say i have ever had a challenge like this before
2348402 its the most inexperienced offensive line that i have ever been associated with but theyre good kids theyre willing to work but at this point we have a long long way to go
2348403 i had one of the very best offensive lines in college football if not the best
2348404 when i left ucla in 1995 our left tackle was jonathan ogden and his backup was kris farris and they both won the outland trophy all of a sudden after three years coach bob toledo didnt get those kinds of players
2348405 the offensive line is maybe the most critical position on your team if you have a strong offensive line with roughnecks who dominate the game everything falls into place the running game happens and the pass protection occurs
2348406 my last two relationships were more trouble than they were worth but i still need to get off regularly so my toys are getting a real workout now i use both toys in my pussy and my ass to get the best orgasms ive actually had butt orgasms which ive never experienced when ive had butt sex with a guy ive gotten into one night stands experimenting really to see if i want to resume serious dating with older guys in their 30s and 40s or with guys about my age right now the older guys are winning out in lots of ways i posed for the magazine because i can always use some extra cash

2348411 i am firmly in favor of informed shareholder choice and the additional disclosures cme has made which incorporated many of my own proposals give shareholders more meaningful information to cast their vote i decided not to seek an injunction because cme and nymex agreed to make disclosures i said were missing from the proxy statement
2348412 my action should not be construed as an endorsement of the terms of this deal
2348413 we will continue our effort in the delaware chancery court to contest the adequacy of the process leading up to the proposed sale and the fairness of the price to be paid by cme if the sale is approved by the shareholders and the members of the exchange
2348414 we cleared an important hurdle today but we have not reached the finish line i still believe nymex has considerable stand alone value and is worth more to cme than cme is paying our chairman richie schaeffer valued nymex at 14 billion just one year ago nyse euronext was prepared to offer 142 a share at the time since then nymex has posted quarter after quarter of record results unfortunately because of how richie schaeffer negotiated the deal the value to nymex shareholders has fallen by about 50 percent meanwhile richie schaeffer jim newsome and the other senior managers of nymex stand to pocket 65 million in severance payments they have put us in a position where we have to choose between bad management and a bad deal in my opinion selling the company in a bear market is too high a price to pay for bad management
2348415 if the shareholders approve the sale we will seek damages to compensate the shareholders for billions of dollars nymex management left on the table however if the shareholders vote down the sale and vote against this deal our efforts will be directed to replacing management developing a new trading platform that will be second to none while we maintain our business relationship with cme and making sure that nymex regains its position as the worlds best commodities marketplace that would be a much better use of the 65 million that richie schaeffer jim newsome and the rest of our leadership would be paid

2348431 social networking web sites arent platforms theyre nightclubs if youre building a facebook app youre building a sound system you can never take out of the club spending money on something which wont work anywhere else only makes sense if the payoff is immediate its not really an investment because assuming any given social network will persist for any given amount of time defies history

2348532 we hold that one who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties
2348533 despite offsetting considerations the argument for imposing indirect liability here is powerful given the number of infringing downloads that occur daily using respondents software grokster and morpheus when a widely shared product is used to commit infringement it may be impossible to enforce rights in the protected work effectively against all direct infringers so that the only practical alternative is to go against the devices distributor for secondary liability on a theory of contributory or vicarious infringement one infringes contributorily by intentionally inducing or encouraging direct infringement and infringes vicariously by profiting from direct infringement while declining to exercise the right to stop or limit it

2348612 the board has made its decision and i accept it and look forward to repairing the breach
2348613 the district the board the administration has wasted far too much time and too much money on this hearing and i think we need to move forward and keep in mind our purpose to restore academic excellence to our district and our students
2348614 products that claim to be eco friendly but do not list all their ingredients or which use generic terms like anionic surfactant cannot be adequately evaluated for their effect on human health or the environment

2348632 the terrorists campaign continues at an unacceptable level and i have had to conclude that the ordinary law cannot deal comprehensively or quickly enough with such ruthless violence
2348633 i have therefore decided to exercise where necessary the powers of detention and internment vested in me as minister of home affairs
2348634 quite obviously the government must act against gunmen shooting in the main streets of belfast especially as the shootings are growing
2348635 internment however is only a short term measure and although it worked before in temporarily removing the leadership of the ira it proved to be no long term solution to the problem

2348643 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2348644 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2348645 in response to our retail partners needs consumer behavior and business efficiencies microsoft is focusing distribution efforts for microsoft money plus software online via software at retail

2348648 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2348649 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware

2348659 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2348660 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2348661 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization

2348665 if i were to play here every day i dont know if i would enjoy it its a very difficult golf course
2348666 im not that aggressive if im not hitting my driver good
2348667 if im hitting bad shots with it you dont hit it as much you hit it right where youve looked whale away
2348668 if youre hitting where youre aiming it every time youre hitting good
2348669 my senior year of high school i went out and watched tiger
2348670 a lot of the players they said hit the ball really long
2348671 its just a matter of taking care of the opportunities that im given theres weeks where you can play your best and not win and theres weeks where you can kind of stumble your way in and win
2348672 unfortunately things didnt happen for me on the back nine its very difficult and this is a major
2348673 theres a lot of golf left out here and the golf course is very difficult
2348674 so i think that it wont be overly difficult if you play well to make up some ground

2348681 the russell 2000 index is strongly outperforming the s amp 500 recently
2348682 the trend of performance has been in favor of small cap stocks since the start of the year and that trend has accelerated if you look at the ratio of the russell 2000 and the s amp p 500 index it has reversed a long term downtrend channel that break out suggests that small cap out performance will continue at least over the short term
2348683 the primary difference is that going into that high in june the russell 2000 index was overbought based on long term overbought oversold indicators
2348684 i use the stochastic oscillator for that now that same indicator is neutral which suggests there is more room for positive follow through in regards to potential demand and supply
2348685 in reality we find the opposite to be the case
2348686 smaller cap companies tend to have niche products and tend to be more nimble from a management standpoint they can react more quickly than larger companies where its like turning a tanker in a river smaller cap companies are like speedboats they turn on a dime and move and react quickly to the business environment
2348687 the economy is dealing with a credit bubble bursting and the dramatic run up in crude oil over the last 18 months
2348688 we are still in digestion phase in terms of dealing with those shocks but when the gun does go off and we probably wont know until after the fact to be frank we will get earnings per share re acceleration growth rates re accelerating and p e multiple expansions as well that is a combination that will serve us well from a performance standpoint
2348689 we dont hear a lot of plain vanilla buying out there

2348817 for a big kid he has a very good feel of his off speed pitches and last fall he was able to shake hitters up and be very effective for us even with an 86 mph fastball because he knew how to pitch
2348818 now hes getting kids to speed up their bats and they have to cheat a little bit to get to the fastball and thats where he can have fun with them
2348819 he has an absolute perfect temperament for a pitcher hes very competitive but he hardly shows emotion and i think that sets him for success long term when you talk about a pro pitcher

2348945 nu een economische crisis dreigt moeten de bestaande arbeidsplaatsen meer dan ooit beschermd worden door een krachtig investeringsbeleid de realisatie van een tweede zeesluis in terneuzen is dan ook een absolute noodzaak om de gentse motor niet te laten sputteren
2348946 moet een woningcorporatie daar 175 miljoen euro in investeren die hard nodig zijn voor het realiseren van betaalbare woningen energiebesparing of het levensloop bestendig maken van huizen
2348947 hoewel woonbron met een solvabiliteit van 40 en een eigen vermogen van n miljard euro een uitgesproken rijke corporatie is betekent een eventuele zeperd dat per woning het vermogen met 3 500 terugloopt dat is ongeveer het bedrag dat je per woning moet uittrekken voor een naisolatieproject
2348948 het is in rotterdam schering en inslag dat corporaties investeren in zaken die niet direct te maken hebben met volkshuisvesting bedrijfspanden maatschappelijk vastgoed sportaccomodaties scholen veiligheid buitenruimte welzijn en nu dus de ss rotterdam op zich is daar wel mee te leven als het maar zo zou zijn dat die corporaties voldoende middelen uittrekken voor onderhoud nieuwbouw en renovatie energiebesparing en service aan de huurders in de sociale woningbouw en dat is nou net weer niet het geval
2348949 geld van huurders wordt zo ingezet voor van alles en nog wat

2348964 ik was daar in opdracht van een eigenaar wiens schip in dezelfde tyfoon was vergaan de twee schepen liggen maar tien mijl uit elkaar
2348965 verder heb ik de plaatselijke kustwacht uitgelegd hoe ze kunnen omgaan met eventuele vervuiling
2348966 als dat vrijkomt is dat genoeg voor een lokale catastrofe

2348970 vijf jaar zonder ernstige ongevallen is een zeer goede prestatie zeker als wordt gekeken naar de risicovolle werkzaamheden die offshore moeten worden uitgevoerd
2348971 ik beschouw deze mijlpaal als een prestatie van ons hele team zowel aan boord van de schepen als door de walorganisatie wordt continu veel tijd en energie gestoken in het verder opvoeren van de veiligheid en kwaliteit
2348972 is het schip voor de nam aan de slag gegaan en dit is nu nog steeds het geval maar dan wel in poolverband de shelf express en haar bemanning is altijd een heel stabiele factor voor de charteraar gebleken
2348973 vandaag lukt het niet hille morgen proberen we het opnieuw
2348974 dan gaan we nog een paar trekjes maken op zee over
2348975 vooral na stormen en onweer kan de situatie opeens heel anders zijn
2348976 in de weekenden komen soms enkele coasters naar het eiland toe vlak voor de kust gaan ze voor anker en viert de bemanning de zondag
2348977 mocht een schip op drift raken dan geeft de computer een alarmbelletje en kunnen wij de schipper waarschuwen
2348978 als kind trokken we er dagelijks opuit we bouwden hutten we speelden op het strand de zee had ons veel te bieden er spoelde meer aan dan tegenwoordig kleren gymschoenen flessen met whisky sloffen met sigaretten al die ervaringen zorgden ervoor dat zich diep in mij een basisgevoel van vrijheid ontwikkelde
2348979 het is de ruimte die trekt de zee die lonkt in de jaren 70 heb ik in de omgeving van arnhem gewoond hoe mooi het er ook is ik kon het er niet uithouden als ik ergens langer dan drie of vier dagen ben dan voel ik me ongemakkelijk dan moet ik het zeewater ruiken vandaar dat ik meteen solliciteerde toen ik hoorde van een vacature op de vuurtoren van schier het werk sprak mij aan en het bood mij de mogelijkheid terug te keren naar mijn roots
2348980 mijn vader zat maanden op zee als hij terugkwam vertelde hij over het leven aan boord van de willem barendds het schip waarmee de expedities werden uitgevoerd hij was beenzager en hielp onderzoekers van de universiteit bij het uitzagen van koppen
2348981 ik kan er uren naar kijken geen golf is hetzelfde in mijn vrije tijd ben ik veel op het water te vinden mijn vrouw en ik varen regelmatig uit met onze seawitch een 11 meter lange zeilboot als je een nacht op het wad hebt gedobberd kan het s ochtends gebeuren dat uit het wateroppervlak naast je schip opeens de kop van een nieuwsgierige zeehond omhoogsteekt met in die mooie ronde ogen de vraag wat doe jij hier
2348982 vanuit mijn stoel kijk ik bij helder weer 50 kilometer van me af verder kan niet vanwege de kromming van de aarde soms ervaar ik bij het zien van de horizon een prikkeling van mijn nieuwsgierigheid wat ligt er achter de streep waar lucht en water elkaar raken waar kom ik uit als ik over die streep heenga
2348983 allerlei vragen gaan dan door me heen waar begint de wereld waar eindigt hij antwoorden heb ik niet maar ik geloof dat er een bijzondere macht is die kan klaarspelen wat wij nooit ofte nimmer kunnen klaarspelen dat moet wel
2348984 we gaan onze eigen weg net als op het vasteland zijn de mensen op schier ook mondiger geworden wat de dominee zegt is niet bij voorbaat waar velen zijn lid van de kerk maar doen er niet veel aan vijftig jaar geleden kwamen er op zondag zon negentig mensen tijdens de diensten bijeen nu hooguit dertig
2348985 bij slecht weer gaan de golven metershoog hoe dichter bij de kust hoe steiler ze zijn brekers zijn het gevaarlijkst als een golf het hoogste punt bereikt en op dat moment als een watermuur instort heb je het zwaar te verduren dan krijg je een enorme klap te verwerken zie dan je bootje maar bestuurbaar te houden
2348986 meestal belt de vrouw in paniek terwijl de man aan het roer staat in zulke ogenblikken merk ik het voordeel van mijn persoonlijke ervaringen op zee dat schept vertrouwen en stelt de mensen aan boord enigszins op hun gemak soms geef ik een advies over het strijken van een zeil soms stel ik voor de golven te tellen op de noordzee geldt de regel dat n op de zeven golven vaak een heel grote is
2348987 we hadden er grote moeite mee om al die opvarenden in veiligheid te brengen
2348988 the fact is that we must either fund all or fund none

2349008 the first house ruled by aries and thus mars is linked with our physical appearance expression etc
2349009 both houses and signs simply represent two ways of looking at the same concept which is inherent in the root idea of the sign itself be it aries taurus gemini or any of the others thus the basic meaning of the first house is neither appearance disposition outlook carriage health vitality or inherent condition but only aries this in the end contains all that needs to be said
2349010 some authors hold an opinion that the signs carry the same signification in order that the houses of heaven do and aries should signify life taurus estate gemini brethren and short journeys you know the rest truly my own opinion is that many authors invented whimsies and when they had done had set them down to posterity for truth who taking them up without trial clothed tradition in plush and left poor reason to go in rags an author said so ergo tis true right or wrong
2349011 thereafter the third house the logic of the theory starts to drift apart and it offers no rational explanation as to why the eighth house of death should precede the tenth house of career and aspirations or why the fifth house of pregnancy and children should precede the seventh house of partnership and marriage attempts to reconcile tradition and contemporary use are clearly contrived and points in favor are supported by creative suggestions rather than historical research and study again the theory relies heavily on modern rulerships which find no verification in traditional practice perpetuating an ever increasing distortion of the traditional house meanings in order to make the hypothesis fit

2349036 certainly we felt some of the groups were not necessarily ones we thought canadians would agree were the best choices to be representing them internationally
2349037 i dont even want to say it their name on the phone
2349038 some of the groups we felt had little to do with our foreign policy or how canadians would want us to be perceived abroad
2349039 abolishing this program is the equivalent of killing the entire culture market abroad
2349040 these all seem to indicate concerns that are based in personal taste and conservative ideology rather than in how to best reflect the diversity of culture in canada and how best to represent canadian cultural expression
2349041 it really does seem to play to the most right wing part of the conservative party
2349042 it doesnt strike me as a strong political strategy for a government that is facing re election and byelections

2349050 the machine like behaviour of people chained to electronics constitutes a degradation of their well being and of their dignity which for most people in the long run becomes intolerable observations of the sickening effect of programmed environments show that people in them become indolent impotent narcissistic and apolitical the political process breaks down because people cease to be able to govern themselves they demand to be managed

2349075 it s a new army and we have a lot of people getting out
2349076 right now people are weighing their options about whether to re enlist or not
2349077 i see these posts as compounds now but on the flip side it s forced this sense of community
2349078 they like the security with your spouse deployed they re feeling a little less secure it s safe to let the kids out and they like that
2349079 the question then is do we lose that sense of community as bases close and consolidate

2349106 sarge because of his 14 years in the service moody was the last player to win the u s open after going through local and sectional qualifying he shot a 72 in the final round at champions golf club in houston for a one shot victory over deane beman al geiberger and bob rosburg
2349107 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second pga tour commissioner tim finchem said
2349108 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could identify with
2349109 the usga was proud to call orville moody an open and senior open champion usga executive director david fay said
2349110 while his victory in the 1969 open at the champions was a surprise orvilles superb ball striking talents were thankfully showcased over the next quarter century both on the regular and senior tour
2349111 the expression he could golf his ball certainly applied to orville
2349112 these two david carr and anthony wright have gone head to head since camp began and there is certainly evidence as of last night that the competition is bringing out the best in both of them and it is highly competitive coach tom coughlin said friday in a conference call
2349113 i told myself before the game to try to have fun relax and enjoy the game carr said
2349114 a lot of things have happened to me over the last couple of years
2349115 you see the performance and you visualize his further development and how he can help you as he goes on coughlin said
2349116 they have not been as sharp as they should be and i think hopefully well get some reaction to that this week coughlin said
2349117 there were opportunities to establish some things at the point of attack that had some success but not enough coughlin said
2349118 it could have been better you can go right down the line they all played and they all had opportunities that position can play better
2349119 the first preseason game can be categorized under one word thats opportunity coughlin said

2349241 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2349242 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2349243 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2349244 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2349245 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2349246 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2349247 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2349248 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2349249 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2349250 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control
2349251 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2349252 its a false reconstruction that does not take account of the historical reality
2349253 this sort of fiction should be banned otherwise the damage to the memory and historical truth will be very serious
2349254 this has been my best training camp and ive made lots of strides in my game all that matters is the belt
2349255 im fighting the toughest guy ever in my career i dont fight for fame i fight for myself and the fans

2349258 me im going down to the westin and staying in a nice room with my caddy which they paid for me and him to fly out
2349259 you see the way they live their lives theyre just trying to make ends meet
2349260 he missed the cut and hes not going to make any money so you see that side of it and you appreciate it a lot more
2349261 if youre not winning if youre not making the playoffs if youre not putting fans in the stands and making money then youre not going to have a job the following season
2349262 so you have to take advantage of that window of opportunity
2349263 i dont know if i have any patience with trent i dont know if you have much patience with anybody
2349264 we try to do as much as we can to help every player get better as fast as they can sometimes its not fast enough for them or for the rest of the organization thats just the way it works it sure is fun but it sure is a challenge too
2349265 i think hes doing a tremendous job of leading by example ive seen nothing but effort in getting us in the direction we need to go
2349266 you need to have the trust of the guy you need to have sort of his approval and he needs to have my approval
2349267 that goes a long way when it comes time to being in a huddle
2349268 talking about it and doing it is a different thing
2349269 i think it went a long way i think it showed that hes serious about his preparation and serious about wanting to play well this season

2349278 the completed product released in 2003 was an immediate hit selling 3 120 units in its first year but through customer feedback the company began learning about design flaws in the bx3 for example the design assumed that most masons would operate the pull down handle that brings the saw into cutting position with their right hand it turns out though that masons typically grip the material theyre cutting with their right hand and pull the handle with their left that made the handle somewhat awkward for many users the company also realized there had been a critical flaw in its design process it had conducted focus groups with contractors and suppliers who would buy the saw but not the masons who would actually use it
2349279 after four years mk diamond decided to redesign the saw and invited masons to its focus groups

2349352 as with previous multi year drm development efforts this one disintegrated like wet kleenex on contact with the general public now that vista hdcp blu ray and hd dvd are all broken it seems like the millions of dollars and thousands of work hours sunk into these systems was mis spent the only benefit that these anti copying systems confer to the companies that developed them is the right to sue competitors and that benefit could have been had by shellacking a one atom thick layer of token drm onto their systems just enough to be able to invoke the dmca everything else was just gold plating wasted money
2349353 i can finally say that i wrote a bunch of the groundwork backstory and structure on the forthcoming ea videogame dead space which recently got a comic prequel from the hands of antony johnston and ben templesmith
2349354 for fuel prices to rival repaying a home loan as a major financial consideration shows just how much the cost of petrol has factored into australian household budgets
2349355 thankfully prices have come down with the global price of oil dropping in recent weeks but the steep cost of petrol is now firmly in the australian financial psyche
2349356 the australian economy has certainly slowed down and the pressure will be on the rba and the banks to reduce rates in the next few months

2349360 house leadership aides pushed back against interpretations of this comment as self aggrandizing
2349361 o ne leadership aide said the full quote put it into a different context
2349362 indeed as noted the leadership aides version of the quote is entirely consistent with numerous other statements obama has made over the last two years
2349363 m y colleague jonathan weisman and i believe the quote was correct as written and that this supposed context is a recreation after the fact by democratic aides who were worried about how the quote looked
2349364 media watchdog groups say the first term senator has garnered far more positive reporting than his opponent especially during his jaunt abroad
2349365 since the primaries ended on air evaluations of barack obama have been 72 negative vs 28 positive thats worse than john mccains coverage which has been 57 negative vs 43 positive during the same time period
2349366 i have become a symbol of the possibility of america returning to our best traditions
2349367 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2349368 tonight more on edwards and the fallout from his admission today about a sexual affair is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2349369 now questions about his edwards future abound in the party and whether this creates another shadow over barack obama as he gets ready for the conventions
2349370 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2349371 i ts 88 days until the election are top democrats pulling for mccain
2349372 this is me im really qualified and john mccains really qualified and barack obama he has a speech that he said once
2349373 is this another skeleton in the democratic closet that barack obama must struggle to overcome
2349374 this is one of the most spectacular finds in europe
2349375 it is sensational to discover a near complete skeleton is unique in romania and a rarity in the world

2349380 a great burden having that pale skin i just remembered having custard blisters on the chest and bright red shoulders in summer
2349381 the first thing they say is oh what lovely hair
2349382 its constantly in the back of my mind that people might mention it
2349383 they make jokes unconsciously and dont even notice after theyve done it
2349384 they pick on gingers more than anyone else and its just because were different
2349385 though i dont think they really know that if you think about it its just the same as racism when i say that though people say its not racist its hairist
2349386 thered have been hell to pay people say its only a joke but if youre 13 and you get it every single day put it another way its like girls coming home from school and being verbally abused by big hairy blokes in vans the websites light its done on a humorous level but we do get people contacting us who are seriously struggling particularly between the ages of 13 and 14 if youre a shy retiring type and dont want attention its pretty hard to just get on with it
2349387 if they are confident lads they will deal with it in a comical way if someone says something about your hair you find something about them they are not going to be perfect
2349388 your grandmothers attitude to us was its a plus youre lucky because not many people have got it presumably because theres so much going the other way it was a bit like kids who are adopted and their parents say youre special we chose you but it worked for me
2349389 by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone
2349390 over the past two hours russian aviation has carried out flights on economic and civilian infrastructure targets there has been an attack on the port of poti and on a railway junction and aerodrome in senaki
2349391 significantly increased its military presence on the border with abkhazia over the past 24 hours
2349392 the united states calls for an immediate ceasefire to the armed conflict in georgias region of south ossetia
2349393 we call on russia to cease attacks on georgia by aircraft and missiles respect georgias territorial integrity and withdraw its ground combat forces from georgian soil
2349394 we underscore the international communitys support for georgias sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders as articulated in numerous un security council resolutions

2349400 of course there will be transfers of sovereignty but would i be intelligent to bring this to the notice of public opinion
2349401 i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness
2349402 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2349403 i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help
2349404 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself
2349405 to sit here and not sign it and postpone this is just poor management this is a project that would take thousands of people off the road
2349406 i dont want to take possession of something that looks like this if we have not done our studies to show theres no contamination in it
2349407 if youre going to put dirt in it who cares about stagnant water right now
2349408 but until we have the proper information im not moving forward
2349409 im asking you to give me a chance to come back
2349410 ive got some kids here i can save that i can make a difference in their lives
2349411 canvas workers make lots of friends and they make some of the best and easiest money on the docks

2349413 that kid is gonna hit somethin look at how he has little control of the boat that kid cant sail i should call the coast gaurd before he causes any damage
2349414 why do that i mean hes out there trying to figure it out dont punnish him for trying cause hes not doing it right go show him how to do it right help him
2349415 that kid cant sail i should call the coast gaurd
2349416 here is another thing to consider when someone makes a mistake and has to pay a price shouldnt that be
2349417 global interest in vmware certification has exceeded even our most ambitious estimates
2349418 among all it certification programs no one is growing more quickly than vmware
2349419 the vmware certified professional credential enables us to demonstrate the technical skills of our virtualization consultants in the most effective way as it is clearly more valuable than simpler paper based certifications said craig cook director of client services long view systems
2349420 authorized vmware training is the fastest growing part of our portfolio and were seeing huge demand from our customers for all the courses we offer virtualization is having a massive impact on the it market so being able to offer authorized training and certification is hugely important for us
2349421 we expect the number of students we train in 2008 to be over a 500 percent increase on 2007 and the first six months is already showing that we are well on the way to achieving that target
2349422 vmware has been focusing on standardization efforts much more seriously of late they realize that the actual hypervisor functionality is being quickly commoditized or near commoditized and like every other virtualization vendor theyre eyeing virtualization management as the source of green field revenue
2349423 it management is by its nature a heterogenous undertaking and even for market leaders like vmware that means promoting standards and openness at least at the lower levels of the stack
2349424 system builders account for a significant number of servers sold around the world especially to small and medium businesses so it is important that we provide them with the tools they need to capitalize on the global market opportunity for vmware virtualization
2349425 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u
2349426 we have development teams working on trading gateways for virtually every major futures exchange around the world
2349427 vmware lab manager 3 gives us much more flexibility in the way we deal with a global lab environment it simplifies administration supports multiple networks and lets us assign resource pools and manage user access rights for all of our teams from a central location vmware lab manager has quickly become the industry standard virtual lab automation solution used by software development and testing teams worldwide said raghu raghuram vice president of products and solutions vmware this new release expands the appeal of vmware lab manager to more groups of people at our customers by promoting effective self service combined with centralized it control

2349431 with cloud computer looming on the horizon it is important for us all to think of the privacy threats there as well
2349432 the tool resides with someone else and the data is stored somewhere else generally that is a bad idea
2349433 when information is in the public domain it is game over
2349434 information on your computer may get protection under the law but on someone elses it gets less protection
2349435 the information we are all giving to online companies is massive and dangerous and its going to get worse before it gets better
2349436 giving them our data is a clear and present risk
2349437 how hard would it be to target someone as a political activist or a person with aids
2349438 as with previous multi year drm development efforts this one disintegrated like wet kleenex on contact with the general public now that vista hdcp blu ray and hd dvd are all broken it seems like the millions of dollars and thousands of work hours sunk into these systems was mis spent the only benefit that these anti copying systems confer to the companies that developed them is the right to sue competitors and that benefit could have been had by shellacking a one atom thick layer of token drm onto their systems just enough to be able to invoke the dmca everything else was just gold plating wasted money

2349442 the real obama promises higher taxes more government spending so fewer jobs

2349446 committed to providing training to new public defenders throughout the south
2349447 knowingly and willfully communicate a false distress message to the coast guard or cause the coast guard to attempt to save lives and property when no help is needed
2349448 just because it is has been a quiet summer does not mean dic have lost interest they are happy that things have now become low key and they are awaiting developments
2349449 it is normal legal procedure for companies to wait three months after the granting of planning permission before signing the lease
2349450 this is because under planning laws the public have a right of appeal for three months after the planning permission is given
2349451 we expect the lease on stanley park to be signed in a matter of weeks
2349452 i cant deny it was an important issue there are very few players who left me against my will
2349453 madrid now know they are dealing with a different animal and cristiano will settle down and enjoy his career here
2349454 he has got four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully we would like to extend it
2349455 you would not like to think that one of the biggest players in the world can just walk out and does not respect his contract
2349456 the specialist he saw yesterday is delighted with the progress
2349457 well now take him to the next stage and for a month he will be in rehabilitation and then he should be in full training by that time
2349458 were happy he has explained himself perfectly from my perspective and the matter is closed he is a manchester united player
2349459 the player is happy to be a manchester united player he has always been happy to be here its just the unfortunate participation of real madrid in the boys life has made it difficult for him
2349460 the important thing is we ended all this stuff about real madrid as he gets older he will appreciate being here more and more because that happens with players the longer they stay here and they dont ever want to leave
2349461 when he scored 25 goals the season before no one thought he could do better than that but i felt he could
2349462 i expected him to improve just as i expect him to improve next season
2349463 of course we are at a different level twenty five goals against 42 is totally different so if he only gets to 41 i will forgive him i am sure he will have a great season
2349464 cristiano has four years left on his contract and at some point hopefully he will extend it
2349465 it does happen to players at this club they end up never wanting to leave
2349466 look at rio ferdinand he joined us as a young man from leeds united now he is a real manchester united person he loves the club
2349467 as time goes on i also feel they begin to take on a role of older statesmen
2349468 you have people like gary neville paul scholes and ryan giggs rio ferdinand now has a big influence on the dressing room and so does edwin van der sar they are experienced players who have been through it all
2349469 it is not easy for young people coming from another country
2349470 it does not matter where they go they have to settle in and get used to another culture then they need to get used to the dressing room
2349471 it doesnt just happen overnight but eventually we hope all the players settle to have great careers here
2349472 i cant deny it was important for us as a club to keep him
2349473 there are very few players who have left me against my will
2349474 hes english he can play in three different positions but im not talking about him we are talking about a player that can play on the left
2349475 three different positions its a positive thing but im talking about one player i dont say the name
2349476 maybe we will sign one more player if we can
2349477 i dont know when but clearly we have problems on the left of midfield
2349478 there is extension years potential voided years and escalators everything ive ever seen in a contract is in this deal
2349479 were talking about a hall of fame caliber player this is a premier guy a leader a player he just wants to win so badly and that is what drove him
2349480 as ive said many times i believe brian westbrook is the best running back in football
2349481 he can do it all from that position whether its running catching the football or blocking
2349482 it is an ideal opportunity to sharpen up before a very important game and it will be ideal preparation
2349483 it is always interesting before the season starts to measure yourselves with the top teams in other countries because it gives you a little bit of a view of how well you can do in europe if you qualify
2349484 now that we are in different countries we agree more times
2349485 i agree totally playing other teams in europe and would choose that for my pre season
2349486 we have played against bayern munich and now we are against dutch and the spanish
2349487 i think it is very important to play against different philosophies of football and tactics to make things difficult for ourselves
2349488 the guys are convinced our regular red car cant win and i have to admit im not far behind them on that theory for whatever reason
2349489 weve done pretty well with the special edition cars and we even tried running one of our blue csk cars for a while this year so we think its time to retire the red car and do something different
2349490 in reality this has a lot to do with the fact we like this body a lot more and its in a lot better shape than our red csk car we really didnt have the time or the desire to paint it after sonoma when the techron vinyl came off so i was looking at it and kind of came up with the monochrome look out of nowhere by not painting it we get to save some money which is just as important as weight these days and we get to tweak the red out of the car just in case who knows if that red design was just plain unlucky but im not going to argue now we have a black and gray car that may look pretty wild but we know its a winning body and we think we can win rounds with it at this stage the bigger question is why not the csk guys told us to go for it and my crew loves the idea of getting the red out so lets try it
2349491 the new organization capabilities in vmware lab manager 3 will help us better enforce role based access rights to system configurations in the lab according to our it policy says tony anastasio technology architect for cerner the leading u

2349505 una extra a criatura en las playas de long island con imagen
2349506 un ex astronauta de la nasa afirma que se ha contactado con extraterrestres
2349507 es un descubrimiento muy importante porque es muy raro encontrar un esqueleto as pues los huesos son peque os y pocas veces se convierten en f siles
2349508 s lo le faltaba la parte del cuello y de la cola
2349509 cos you can come on youre better than this you can do it
2349510 un brillante estallido de luz que estaba compuesto de muchas chispas peque as y separadas que se mov an todas juntas en l nea recta hacia la parte norte del mare imbrium y otros lugares de la superficie de la luna
2349511 cerca del cr ter birt hay un objeto en forma de espada y un objeto geom trico en forma de cruz en el cr ter erast stenes en el cr ter gassendi existen l neas angulares y en el fondo del cr ter littrow siete puntos formando la letra griega gamma
2349512 uno de los rasgos de la luna mas asombrosos misteriosos y aparentemente artificiales
2349513 est is seguros de que no hay nadie mas ah arriba
2349514 estudiando el resto del sistema solar llegamos a la conclusi n de que la luna no deber a estar ah
2349515 probablemente tenia una capa doble la base un denso armaz n blindado de un espesor de unos 30 km y sobre el una cubierta menos compacta una capa mas fina de unos 4 5 km
2349516 cuando el meteorito choca contra la cubierta exterior de la luna esta act a como una capa amortiguadora de los golpes y el cuerpo extra o tropieza con una impenetrable barrera esf rica
2349517 creemos que las cuestiones que hemos planteado en relaci n a nuestra luna proporcionan base suficiente para considerar seriamente el asunto el resultado puede ser la clarificaci n de muchos misterios lunares
2349518 algunas de las rocas arrojan una inaceptable edad de 7 000 m a
2349519 dos de las rocas del apollo 11 datan de hace 20 000 m a estas edades parecen imposibles ya que cuadruplican la de nuestro planeta y de todo el sistema solar
2349520 la composici n de la luna no es en absoluto la que deber a ser si se hubiera formado en la rbita actual alrededor de la tierra
2349521 si la luna estuvo alguna vez tan cerca de la tierra como para que el campo magn tico de sta pudiera magnetizar sus rocas los dos cuerpos habr an estado tan cerca que la luna hubiera estallado bajo la acci n de la fuerza de gravedad terrestre
2349522 estar habit ndola antes de que la luna apareciera en los cielos
2349523 estos eran los arcadios seguidores de evander el llamado pueblo prelunar
2349524 en la que todos los astros no estaban todav a en el cielo
2349525 a los tiempos anteriores a la existencia de la luna
2349526 tu eras temido desde la poca de el sol y antes de la poca de la luna una generaci n de generaciones
2349527 si se encontrara una cosa similar en la tierra el primer objetivo de la arqueolog a habr a sido inspeccionar el lugar y efectuar excavaciones de sondeo para confirmar el alcance del descubrimiento
2349528 es curioso que se la primera vez que se observa una cosa de este tipo es posible que se haya formado una c pula recientemente
2349529 en el fondo esta cubierto con bloques unos cinco metros
2349530 justo aqu el azul que describ desde la ventana del modulo lunar esta coloreado porque esta recubierto de cristal pero bajo el cristal es cristalino de la misma textura que la roca g nesis mi marcador esta muerto
2349531 mejor ser que env en un par de chicos mas aqu arriba
2349532 chico te lo digo yo estos emus y plss son realmente superfantasticos
2349533 cuando se descubr a algo los astronautas y capcom aparentemente utilizaban un c digo establecido de antemano algunas veces incluso en un canal alterno que no pod a controlarse p blicamente
2349534 a 7 millas del bulliald el ranger 7 hizo una filmacion nica un gran objeto met lico que se aleja hacia una zona en penunbra posee forma redondeada y un cilindro con una torreta peque a en su parte superior en el cilindro se aprecian aberturas a igual distancia unas de otras de la torreta surge una neblina o vapor este aparato esta acompa ado por otro objeto que recuerda a un gran matraz o bombilla en ambos se pueden apreciar signos distintivos
2349535 en los ltimos a os mas de 200 estructuras blanquecinas circulares con forma de c pula han sido observadas sobre la luna y catalogadas pero por alguna extra a raz n a menudo desaparecen de un lugar y reaparecen en otro
2349536 parece artificial es casi imposible que una cosa parecida se haya formado en primera instancia o si se formo que haya podido durar a trav s de los siglos que lleva existiendo la luna se pensar a que deber a haberse desintegrado por la variaci n de la temperatura o por los impactos de los meteoros
2349537 un rea considerablemente mas iluminada que las zonas de alrededor
2349538 un grupo de colinas formando un tri ngulo de ngulos muy agudos conectadas por tres terraplenes mas bajos
2349539 i was outside and i happened to find myself in a clothing store and here is some of the dialogue that took place between me and the clerk t theo c clerk i was running into the store when the clerk asked me how i was
2349540 due to the serious allegations that have been raised regarding cuppys failure to honor various contractual commitments and your apparent decision to cease our communications i have determined to suspend your accredited status with the aafd pending consideration and action of the aafd board of directors
2349541 our purpose remains to inspire fair contracts and collaborative relationships and we are open to negotiating and mediating effective relief for all cuppys franchisees in a manner that will effect restitution from injuries and will allow cuppys coffee to achieve the corporate goals set by new management upon its acquisition of the company
2349542 i have never felt that i am homosexual because i have never let them make love to me
2349543 its the opposite i penetrate i have never liked it being done to me
2349544 if the state of new york makes drastic changes to housing regulation
2349545 no residential developer will build another rental building in new york city
2349546 friends or even acquaintances have been to wonder aloud or even quite randomly in their heads for no one spends too much time thinking about him intentionally if they had any say in the matter just exactly how this rather non spectacular creature managed to have such a decent life despite
2349547 you know youre going to get sick if all you eat is pot noodles
2349548 how on earth do you know that it is not as if you hear very often on the news about people falling over with an incriminating cup of pot noodles in their hands
2349549 honestly just take a look at the nutritional facts it does not take a rocket scientist to figure it out
2349550 i guess it is a good thing that i am no rocket scientist is it
2349551 and i have looked there is less sodium in it you know 50 in fact
2349552 exactly my point there is even less of nothing in there there is nothing at all for you to sustain any life man cannot live on sweet and sour pot noodle alone do you hear me
2349553 you are mad and i will have you know that this is chicken satay pot noodle and there is a wide variety of pot noodle flavours to satisfy any possible culinary craving the average everyday man may have
2349554 i was thinking that you get yourself a flat mate you could sublet the other bedroom that no one uses and probably will never use for a while and make a bit of money for yourself i am serious about the pot noodle thing imagine being able to buy real food
2349555 real food i would have to cook and handle on my own
2349556 shush do not interrupt me as i was saying you could get a flat mate who would take the extra bedroom and help you cover your other expenses and get your rent paid on time just think about it all right i can even help you find a non psychotic non git who is low maintenance enough to live with you day in and day out
2349557 yes i am but well find you something nonetheless all right say youll at least think about it
2349558 i will think about it it is a really good idea in fact
2349559 why do you have to sound so surprised to hear that
2349560 and when vick here said that she knew of the perfect flat for me that was not even listed yet well of course i had to come right over and check it out i trust her to be a real woman of taste
2349561 this is really quite nice i am really glad i listened
2349562 the big things are obvious dylan is not necessarily the neatest person in the world but it would not bode well for either of you if you do not at least maintain your mess to your room and manage to keep all shared areas to be at least presentable to anyone who may come over for a visit particularly anyone of the female persuasion
2349563 we discussed the rent and the division of utilities as well earlier right i suppose it is up to the two of you to discuss the personal rules like usage of the lavatory and who having girlfriends over so it would be fruitless for me to take charge of that
2349564 i think that we can handle it from here on out vick thank you darling miles what do you think of the place i suppose if my girlfriend trusts you enough then that is good enough for me
2349565 all i have to say is you know mate draw up the contracts and tell me when to send in my cheque i would love to live with you this is perfect the location is not too far from work and this this feels like a good place to be
2349566 christ is that the time i thought i would have more to see this but you know what they say right when you are having fun and all that but i do need to get back to work no rest for the wicked
2349567 that is my primary contact information my mobile is also on there let us talk again and get everything sorted soon eh i would love to move in as soon as possible are you free tomorrow
2349568 good then that is settled i can call you early tomorrow morning and let you know i reckon we can do lunch
2349569 you can he wakes up far earlier than he needs to for work let me get you his numbers
2349570 that first one is his mobile and the second is him at work
2349571 this is perfect brilliant i will definitely be ringing you up tomorrow and forgive me but i really do need to get back
2349572 vick thank you for introducing us you have done me a real favour you know
2349573 that was not so bad thank you for helping me lift the heavier things i do not think i would have been able to take care of things on my own
2349574 i though vicky was going to be here tonight to help is that not what she said
2349575 my girlfriend is a very busy woman you could hardly expect her to rearrange her full schedule in order to help you change the sheets on your bed can you i am just barely lucky enough to get that privilege
2349576 you really are a lucky one and you know i think i ought to take a shower check out the bathroom and all that you do not mind do you
2349577 you sure gave me a mighty scare there you were practically shaking there muttering no no i figured you were having a bad dream
2349578 you look a bit flushed there you sure you are all right
2349579 no i am fine you do not have to worry about me it was obviously just a dream
2349580 i hear the weather is actually going to be nice and dry today it will still be as cold as a witchs tit but it will be nice not to have to walk to the bus stop while fighting against the wind and snow
2349581 this woman this widow was arguing with me over the estimated price over a bit of artwork her late husband had collected see and she was certain it was worth much more than 10 000 pounds
2349582 i do not have the heart to break it to this woman that her bit of art is practically worthless or at least it is in comparison with how much she wants it is funny though she so adamantly stressed her grief at the loss of her most beloved husband but she is so ready to give up one of his favourite and most prized possessions for a bit of coin honestly i tell you i do not understand how love works nowadays not at all it used to be a much more beautiful romantic thing
2349583 i told her exactly how much it would go for and not to sound completely full of myself but it was not for very much at all i managed to talk her down after she threatened my boss fucking pollack painting that was hanging over the desk with a fucking letter opener and jesus those things are sharp man
2349584 what was that about love you said how could love have changed so drastically in the time you have been alive i mean how old are you 25
2349585 be rest assured that i am a bit over thirty i look good for my age that is all
2349586 no to say the very least that is a kind of would that never quite stops hurting honestly sometimes i wonder if it would have been better if i had never met her and spared myself all the agony
2349587 why have we not heard from vicky since that other day i thought she said she was going to visit again to make sure we were settling in all right
2349588 what about her i told you she can get very busy why do you need to know
2349589 dylan i will be having a visitor this afternoon i am getting off of work early and should be having a late lunch here you are welcome to join us of course if you get back in time though i doubt i just wanted to run it by you first
2349590 this is my old mate robin whom i have not seen in a very long time theo dylan he is my flat mate
2349591 nice to meet you lovely place you have here i am surprised you let this silly ponce live with you
2349592 i am so sorry to run out on you like this i assure you i am not leaving on your account in fact i am already late for my next appointment
2349593 so you have known miles for a long time how long have you two been friends
2349594 i am really sorry to see you go mate you need to stop by again all right we have a lot of catching up to do
2349595 i will i absolutely will it is good to have you back in london miles
2349596 have some s good do not worry i did not make it
2349597 so what are your plans for this glorious day are you going to spend it with vicky i imagine she does not work nearly as much on saturdays at least i hope not that would be downright cruel
2349598 yeah i am supposed to see her later in the afternoon
2349599 normally she would have come over after work on friday and we would sleep in late but they have been very busy lately i reckon she did not come home until really early this morning no idea what i am going to do with my morning now to pass the time there is no way i will be able to get back to sleep again
2349600 yeah i was planning on taking a walk to the park find a new place to eat after it has been a long time since i have been here i imagine a lot has changed since then
2349601 oh yes there has been a lot of progress in the past few years particularly with the restaurants or at least that is what i have heard i do not get out nearly enough for that kind of thing sadly
2349602 do you that would be perfect no that is perfectly perfect you pick out the place and i will pay for lunch it would be my way of returning the favour
2349603 that would be cool yeah how can i say no
2349604 brilliant well i was going to the park for a run first but this way you can join me maybe play a bit of footie that sounds like fun right
2349605 wait footie running with our feet miles i do not know if i really am physically capable of doing those things
2349606 i mean i am truly impressed i did not realise that a man could turn that shade of grey before
2349607 you should have told me when you were tired we could have stopped and let you rest
2349608 it is it is fine you you you you you
2349609 so that was a fun morning do you not think
2349610 that was a good way to spend the morning yes are you all right now
2349611 aside from the part i nearly passed out saw a bright light at the end of a tunnel and my great aunt ethel tried to guide me toward it i would say that was just so you know i am going to sleep next weekend and tomorrow do not wake me tomorrow or you will die for today
2349612 i will see what i can do about that thank you for humouring me and taking me out and about
2349613 it is not a bad job playing the receptionist there always seems to be someone out there that needs someone else to answer their phones for them sometimes it is a need for organization or for someone else to take the burden off the person doing the bigger things and sometimes it is just a general need to sound more impressive and important by having someone to answer their phones
2349614 i know it is not a very prestigious job but i enjoy what i do
2349615 yes you know it seemed like a good idea at the time because the history and literature really interested me but once i finished i realised how completely pointless it was to have a degree like that there is not much work for a guy like me other than to teach it to students who will have nothing else to do with their futures other than to teach it to yet another generation of students
2349616 i do not believe it to be quite honest with you
2349617 i think there is work out there for someone with your background i might know someone who could get you a job at the museum you know i can make a phone call
2349618 i insist i will talk to someone it is not as if i am pulling strings to get you the job i will simply be inquiring to see if there was a spot available and if you will be able to try out for it how is that is that good enough for you
2349619 actually that might be kind of nice if you can arrange it what harm is there in inquiring
2349620 that is the spirit my boy then it is settled you are a nice enough guy personable sometimes and are rather smart from what i can see you cannot waste your time behind a desk answering phones
2349621 hey youre going out with vicky this weekend right i will not take that away from you but how about ah monday night you two stay in i am sure i can get you that interview monday morning and we can celebrate your new job and her all at once we can cook for her from the sound of it she sounds as if she had a rather trying week and i think she was worried about us getting on after i moved in
2349622 i do not know she might think it an opportunity to gloat and i told you so her way through a meal i do not mean to sound bitter but i really hate it when she is right and she is right an awful lot
2349623 it is a great idea though and thank you again vick might well kiss you when she finds out that you might be getting me a job
2349624 the weather has been quite nice lately considering do you not think
2349625 yeah i believe it has been cool but dry i have a feeling though that the worst is still yet to come
2349626 honestly i am so impressed i did not think the two of you had it in you to do this
2349627 you are much too kind we boiled pasta in water and heated up some tomato sauce with a few added ingredients have a seat in the living room and we can bring dessert and some coffee out for you
2349628 it has been a long time since i was able to do that i missed you dylan and after a dinner like that i can certainly remember why
2349629 i am glad we had a bit of fun putting it together you will be happy to hear but it would have been all for naught if you hated it
2349630 it was perfectly lovely i did not expect that the two of you would be able to actually get your acts together and work as a team but you two have really impressed me how on earth did you have time to get all this done after work
2349631 it was nothing really i was so excited to have the new job and to see you again that it all came together so nicely i missed you darling
2349632 ta da oh sorry should i leave the two of you alone
2349633 oi vick darling i hope you have enjoyed the meal i have hardly seen you in almost a week when you set this whole thing up i was afraid you were only chatting me up just to get me for your boyfriend here
2349634 you should come around a lot more often we could do with a bit more estrogen around here
2349635 work has been terrible this week i think someone out there must have it out for me everything that could possibly go wrong has completely gone to shit this week this country wants this price for oil and this thinks the other one is dumping toxic shit in theirs i tell you i do not know how i got involved in all this bollocks
2349636 my poor darling girl i suppose this means i have to let you have a quiet night tonight does it not terrible first time i have seen you all week and i need to keep from touching you
2349637 oi the pair of you i am still in the room in case that has escaped your notice
2349638 if you would like i can promise to take an extra sleeping pill tonight and lock myself up in my room with my loudest pair of headphones
2349639 actually that will not be necessary i do not think i will be able to stay the night but thank you miles for your very kind offer
2349640 what do you mean you are not staying the night
2349641 dylan do not make such a fuss over this work just came up i cannot stop these things from happening i am getting paid to do a job and we both knew that it would take me away sometimes
2349642 but i do not see how it is taking you away from us tonight you are hear now why can you not stay here until morning
2349643 i have to get up early tomorrow morning we have a last minute flight to dubai and i have yet to pack i just could not leave until i saw you one more time there are a lot of meetings and conferences and international delegations coming up where they will be discussing some very important topics to me we will be going all over for the next few weeks so i will need to be prepared i am sorry darling
2349644 i have seen the way that rhys harris bloke looks at you with those big blue eyes the sparkling whitened teeth and perfect hair it would not bother me so much if you did not look back
2349645 you want to date other people oh yes that is fine that is just fine
2349646 yeah i can see that mate but maybe you should stop and take a break
2349647 it is from my own private reserve drink up it will make you feel better and you really look like you could use it
2349648 she will not take my calls or answer my emails i have no idea where she is i think i might have actually fucked it all up this time
2349649 you talked to vicky i ought to kill you man i am going to too as soon as i get control of my limbs again
2349650 do not let yourself get riled up about it yes i have spoken to her yes i know where she is she is fine and you should not worry she called you but changed her mind and decided she could not talk to you not yet at least the space will do the two of you good i am sure when she gets back in two months the two of you will be able to work things out and live happily ever after i am sure
2349651 i cant believe you kept that from me you fucking wanker i have been tearing my self up all week and you you fuck
2349652 i am sorry im sorry i did not mean for it to be that way she made me promise that i would not tell you that i spoke with her i have been keeping updated on your status though she feels guilty but this is what the two of you need after that
2349653 i just wanted to let you know i was back and wanted to see how you were doing
2349654 i do not know what you are talking about i have not won anything we were not even playing a game were we
2349655 oh yeah of course you have no idea nothing was going on at all you did not keep me distracted at work with the fancy dream job nor did you keep yourself in her good graces while i made an arse out of myself and
2349656 you cannot blame me for this nor can you blame yourself this can happen sometimes when you have been with the same person for so long you are at time in your life where the two of you are going to really figure yourself out and where you want to go you are not going to be the same people you were when you met
2349657 but the thought is nice i suppose it should be no surprise that you would have more loyalty to vicky you have known her longer
2349658 it is not fair if you are practicing sobriety while i am the very antithesis of you right now go on bottoms up sir
2349659 do not be so stingy that is my liquor after all
2349660 so there i was hanging onto the fire escape outside the window with one hand ad hanging onto the towel providing me my only bit of modesty with the other hand just praying and hoping and waiting for her husband to leave already and that he does not spot me once he does
2349661 he closes the window because he was getting cold understandable because it is winter after all and decides that he does not get to spend enough time with his wife so they leave so here i am arse naked and freezing my cock off and without my wings could have just flown away if i had them on me at the time
2349662 oh yeah because you are a right angel you are you could have flown right off and saved yourself maybe give some old woman a real thrill when she looks up and gets a great view of what is underneath that towel
2349663 robin you said you had known him forever or he said you had known him forever it was one of the two
2349664 there seems like there might be an interesting history with you two
2349665 i do not know what to say i mean honestly we have known each other for so long i do not even remember when we first met we simply were just always mates
2349666 no that is crap complete crap how about a real story
2349667 that is what he said you do not have to act all surprised just tell me if it is true or not and i can stop wondering
2349668 aha i knew it i knew you would have that seems like something you would do he seems like your type
2349669 my wait what my type i have a type in men and you know what it is
2349670 do not know i was just thinking i suppose if that is your type he is a rather attractive fellow quite fit you know
2349671 this is not funny you do not get to laugh all right
2349672 actually you know what is funny he said the same thing about you last night while he was pissed maybe you should be the one snogging him
2349673 i would mate but i would feel like such a horrible friend i would never betray you and it is not as if i do not know just how powerful your wrath is upon anyone who dare comes between you and your dear psyche
2349674 do you not think i do not know i remember what it used to be like back in the golden times of the past i remember the other men and i remember how easy it was to go along with it
2349675 do you not think that possibly you are over thinking about this one a little too much it seems pretty simple to me you fancy dylan go with it
2349676 when is it ever that simple i had thought it was vicky i was convinced of it i could feel it off her and when she walked through that door every part of me knew that it had found what it was calling for
2349677 not to be crass ha ha ha right but after being together for so long there is a lot of dylan inside of her by now right
2349678 philistine honestly i do not even know why i bother talking to you
2349679 with whom else would you talk there is no one else no one would would bother to listen at least you know that you also know what you need to do but you are being too much of a stupid sod to do something about it other than going on with this bag of wank
2349680 give it a bit of thought and you will see oh yes you will see that i know exactly what i am talking about
2349681 oh you know me far too will mate yes i will have one two actually to go
2349682 not today i am in a bit of a rush to get home today but maybe next time we can catch up all right
2349683 of course dylan try not to wait too long to come back next time okay i want to know how things are going with you and that lovely girl of yours vicky is that right
2349684 yeah yes that is her name like i said i have to go good day
2349685 this is a really good sandwich where did you get it
2349686 oh thanks oh it is just from some place down the street i would pass it on the way to and from the reception job and thankfully i still pass it between here and the museum
2349687 why are you sitting so far away come on you have a sofa for a reason
2349688 yes i was things had gotten quiet at work and they did not need me anymore so i came home your being here was a pleasant surprise
2349689 yes it was i hardly know you yet we live together i do not know about you but i was not raised to be that kind of girl
2349690 why are you so nervous to be around me dylan
2349691 stop please just give me a moment to breathe for christs sake
2349692 just do not talk not yet i still cant process this yet i
2349693 do not be scared listen this is not all that common for me either but there is something there is something there is there not
2349694 christ miles i have a girlfriend i cant go around kissing other people especially not other blokes what the fuck am i this is not good this is not how it is supposed to fuck i do not even know any more this is
2349695 did you not both agree before she left that you were both allowed to see other people while she was gone
2349696 yeah yeah we did in shouts but that is what we said before we went off
2349697 what what did she say when you talked to her what did she say
2349698 she said she needed some time away from you and all this
2349699 nothing more interesting than what is going on in here
2349700 sadly not yet i brought in a bit of breakfast it is not much but i think if last night was any indication for how today was going i reckon we are going to need our energy
2349701 cheeky monkey all right feed me then and we will see how the rest will go i think i am getting used to this idea of you and me you know
2349702 oh oh hi yes i am afraid to say that i do have plans this evening maybe next time
2349703 are you sure these are plans you cant just postpone we can you know get to know you better we will be working very closely together from now on after all
2349704 yes i think this is exactly how tuscany tastes though a nice glass of wine would be nice too
2349705 right well next time you remember the wine all right
2349706 what no chocolate biscuits for after and i thought this was supposed to be some sort of grand romantic gesture
2349707 i cant do everything you know when are you going to bring anything to the table
2349708 these just came in for a new exhibit and i get to help them prepare them
2349709 i know it is a clich but that one is one of my favourites since i started uni it was sent in from florence
2349710 but there was have you not heard the stories then that there was someone a mortal whose beauty matched hers even surpassed it so much so that even she was jealous
2349711 miles hello always a pleasure to see you though i must admit i did not expect to see you here amongst the priceless paintings i have here on loan
2349712 that is right sir nice to meet you again mr morgan
2349713 please call me henry at least if no one else is listening
2349714 miles you should probably get back to work soon you know
2349715 your boss already knows that you are getting up to mischief can you not take advantage of that
2349716 i wish i could tell you that you can stick around longer if you would like but i have a feeling you might be a little distracting
2349717 all right get the fuck out of here you silly ponce
2349718 do not do this you are nothing more than a stupid little boy do you know that this is nothing more than a little fun on the side a real man does not do this regularly
2349719 no that is not right you cant tell you me do not feel it as well you do feel it too do you not we are supposed to be in love you are my psyche
2349720 fucking shut up about that shit you sound like you are fucking insane do you hear how completely touched in the head you sound when you talk about that fucking cupid eros whatever god of love my ass
2349721 you are a pathetic little bastard you know a fucking abomination do you know that you put too much stock into this love thing the new era is amongst us the biggest war ever is over and life is starting all over and you still believe with your whole being in that foolish idea like love what have you done with your life other than chase some dream around the world like you were don qui fucking ote pathetic
2349722 you are worse than a woman honestly you listened to that
2349723 ahh i think i got some down the back of me shirt
2349724 yes i would say it was i cant believe you knocked those poor childrens snowman over though
2349725 i didnt mean to do it you all acted as if i did it intentionally and i assure you i most certainly did not i am not that cruel
2349726 no i suppose youre not youre far too kind for something like that arent you
2349727 thank you you really are just so good to me sometimes a bit lower that feels so good
2349728 what what is it you can tell me you know
2349729 no it is nothing really i am just curious does it hurt less over time you do not seem to mind it when you know when it is you
2349730 yes it hurts less after a few times soon all it is is total pleasure and that unbelievable feeling of being filled both literally and figuratively i would never do anything to hurt you
2349731 leaning in he kisses him on the cheek and on the mouth once more totally incapable of giving it up just yet and while he knows it will take him a while to pack up all his things and to extricate his own clothes from the piles that he had began to share with dylan he pushes that moment off even more avoiding something he never believed he would ever do once again
2349732 sorry mate i think youve mistaken me for someone else
2349733 meet me at the restaurant around the corner you know the one i will be there in twenty minutes once i drop this one off at school
2349734 and you do not get to walk out this time
2349735 my name is not miles my name isnt even really julian theyre just names i go by
2349736 what on earth are you talking about and where have you been
2349737 listen i cant do this here can we talk somewhere more private
2349738 the flat is not that far from here you know no one is home vickys at work and delia is at school no one will be home for hours
2349739 i cant go back there it does not seem right
2349740 come back to my hotel room it is not very far from here i dont have quarters yet
2349741 stop this is not what i wanted when i invited you back here
2349742 dont be so coy i missed you you missed me
2349743 a lot can happen in the time you were gone ten years right
2349744 you dont have to be afraid of my answer i do love you i did love you i just dont think you will believe me
2349745 how can you expect me to trust you at all after you left me the way you did
2349746 then why did you come here asking questions if you wouldnt believe my answers
2349747 i didnt lie then when i told you i love you and i am not lying when i say it again now
2349748 tell me then why did you leave like that miles
2349749 i told you i dont go by that name anymore
2349750 thats it you were scared of course you were bloody scared thats love for christs sake do you think i wasnt either but it was something we could have gotten through together instead you chose to leave me alone
2349751 there is a lot to it that you just dont know and i dont even know where to begin telling you i am so tired of this pain of falling in love and losing it again and again every time i think this is it this is when it fixes itself and this is when it will last it hurts so much every time it happens and i dont know if i could handle going through all that again with you
2349752 do you realise how ridiculous and stupid you sound at this moment
2349753 i have to change it every once in a while
2349754 i told you you wont believe me if i told you
2349755 i change identities every so often every decade or two it keeps from arousing too many suspicions
2349756 you know the story of eros and psyche right of course you do
2349757 yes they found each other again after psyche searched all over for him and performed all sorts of arduous tasks and the gods made her immortal so that they could be together forever
2349758 yeah thats one version of the story just not the true one
2349759 it doesnt matter what version it is none of them are true anyway
2349760 that is where you are wrong the stories are true and eros and psyche did find each other again but the truth is that she was not made immortal like the story says she died the girl was reincarnated and then died again and on and on the story repeats itself eros was forced to spend a few blissful years with her in love and not alone until he loses her again to her own mortality
2349761 you didnt have to make up such a big lie you could have just told me the truth you could have just said that you didnt want to stay
2349762 at first i was so afraid i had the wrong person i did not think it could really be you but you fit i could feel it whenever i was around you every molecule of my body would sing to the heavens
2349763 ive fallen in love with you countless times and had to watch you die each time even the gods weep and hurt dylan i couldnt go through that again not with you you were too special
2349764 youre fucking mad arent you bloody well delusional youre not fucking cupid and im not some dead girl from ancient greece
2349765 you can believe me or not i know im telling the truth dylan
2349766 i could never give you the life you have now
2349767 listen to me first you deserve all of this the beautiful wife who worships and takes care of you and the daughter who looks more and more like you with every passing day and the job that lets you do exactly what you love i cant do anything but take all that away from you if i take you away to be with me i will not do that to you
2349768 is it really so easy for you to walk away again just a shag and another good bye well i suppose that i should at least feel grateful that i even get a good bye this time
2349769 how can you have the audacity to ask me yet again to keep living on without you knowing that you are out there and not here
2349770 tomorrow everything will be better than today and you will get to live out a happy full life
2349771 to love means to open ourselves to the negative as well as the positive to grief sorrow and disappointment as well as to joy fulfillment and an intensity of consciousness we did not know was possible before

2349780 its no longer a publication im quitting after this slate article and this is the future of journalism in new york city i dont want any part of it
2349781 he truly acts like the rock and roll or the music critic and if you dont talk to him right away and for as long as he wants to he feels slighted
2349782 mr rosen i suppose it is time that we made contact since i seem to be your favorite new obsession for such a heralded and busy journalist it is obvious that you have an abundance of free time in your daily schedule you have done an exemplary job of exposing the seedy underbelly of duplicitous small town weekly newspapers and the evil doers that run them you have indeed brought us to our knees
2349783 i sincerely apologize for my crimes against you and any perceived damage done to your person or your career accomplishments it was never my intention to cause you harm the article in question was included in other press materials i had received via e mail i used parts of the article as background and did so thinking it was cleared for such use but as you have so subtly pointed out i was mistaken
2349784 it must have taken years of seasoned investigative know how to push me off my lofty perch it takes a dogged intrepid journalist to expose the alleged wrongdoings of a 44 year old college dropout who drifted from one lousy media job to another for 20 years it takes courage to debase someone with a mouthful of cut rate dentures who up until 2007 lived in his parents home for seven years due to near fatal bouts of clinical depression it takes a journalist of a certain caliber to torpedo a pathetic hack who has barely squeezed out a living for nearly a decade at seven cents a word
2349785 its a little odd to play against a group of individuals that ive been so close to for so long its like playing in the backyard with your family so its different that way
2349786 but you know you got to separate and move on
2349787 thats what its all about having fun the guy thats pitching over there is a great friend of mine
2349788 hes been a good player his whole career he had a good day today i didnt notice anything and nobody said anything to me about it

2349792 he didnt leave me a whole lot of plate but i thought i might have snuck my hand in there when he called me out he had a pretty good view of it
2349793 in 2006 i made a serious error in judgment and conducted myself in a way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs
2349794 i recognized my mistake and i told my wife that i had a liaison with another woman and i asked for her forgiveness although i was honest in every painful detail with my family i did not tell the public
2349795 with my family i took responsibility for my actions in 2006 and today i take full responsibility publicly
2349796 it is inadequate to say to the people who believed in me that i am sorry as it is inadequate to say to the people who love me that i am sorry
2349797 in the course of several campaigns i started to believe that i was special and became increasingly egocentric and narcissistic if you want to beat me up feel free
2349798 you cannot beat me up more than i have already beaten up myself i have been stripped bare and will now work with everything i have to help my family and others who need my help

2349801 you cant lie in politics and expect to have peoples confidence
2349802 i think this president has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
2349803 it is breathtaking to me the level to which that disrespect has risen
2349804 i want to see our party lead on the great moral issues yes me a democrat using that word the great moral issues that face our country
2349805 if we want to live in a moral honest just america and if we want to live in a moral and just world we cant wait for somebody else to do it we have to do it

2349837 america is about to enter a fractured chaotic era of news characterized by the superior community conversations made possible by blogs and also by a steep drop in first rate journalism as a piece in the current issue of the new yorker points out the result will be clusters of communities with their own ideas of news and truths and the loss of a single national narrative and agreed upon sets of facts by which to conduct our policies
2349838 there are too many papers selling the same news the yearly is out and there may be a light at the end of the tunnel that is the news world is at the end of the tunnel and the train is headed rapidly toward it during the current downturn i wonder whether one single paper has said it looks like our subscriber base is dwindling and the young people are not reading the paper its time we beefed up coverage we have to find more writers and editors and put them to work to improve our product exactly when did cheapening the product and making it worse become the way to do things in the u s a hey our cars are crap lets make them worse good thinking benson give yourself a raise hey our airplanes are crashing left and right and people are not buying them anymore lets see if we can make them cheaper that will solve our problems what am i not getting

2349840 sarge because of his 14 years in the service moody was the last player to win the u s open after going through local and sectional qualifying he shot a 72 in the final round at champions golf club in houston for a one shot victory over deane beman al geiberger and bob rosburg
2349841 i am so sorry to hear that sarge has passed
2349842 sarge was a good player and a terrific guy he had this sort of dry sense of humor that everyone truly enjoyed he was one of those people you couldnt help but enjoy being around
2349843 we are all going to miss sarge who was a patriot first and a professional golfer second pga tour commissioner tim finchem said
2349844 he embodied a bit of golfs everyman whom we all could identify with
2349845 the usga was proud to call orville moody an open and senior open champion usga executive director david fay said
2349846 while his victory in the 1969 open at the champions was a surprise orvilles superb ball striking talents were thankfully showcased over the next quarter century both on the regular and senior tour
2349847 the expression he could golf his ball certainly applied to orville
2349848 just do what i said and dont tell me about it
2349849 a pole is always nice and achieving a small record makes it of course even sweeter personally i don t care too much about this i always want to be as far in front as possible we ve done that the car was good i made a small mistake on my quickest lap it would have probably been possible to be one or two tenths faster but nevertheless i am happy and satisfied we even do not have to do much more for the race because we already have a good race set up too
2349850 congratulations to our record man lucas luhr has done a good job pole position with a great time i think it looks good also for the race it will certainly be a difficult race as it is four hours long we are in a good shape starting from pole position even if this is not so important in such a long race it is critical that we are consistently fast in the race and we should be
2349851 i m still learning but generally things are already going pretty well i begin to feel really comfortable in the car i still need to know the race track the car and the team a little bit better i need to improve for the race but up until now i m happy
2349852 i m quite satisfied we started with losing one part of the first session due to small problems and with a car quite far from a good balance it took us a long time to catch back up even during the qualifying session we improved the car i think we are 90 percent good now and we can look forward to the race with full tanks the car is good
2349853 lucas luhr did a very good lap in qualifying congratulations to him to the engineers and the whole crew everybody did a great job today
2349854 theres a light in hafs eye again which is always good to hear
2349855 hes seeing that its not too far away which should be exciting for everybody
2349856 its also getting the shoulder back in shape and the mechanics and getting the muscle memory fired up again
2349857 right now we arent optimistic that he will pitch this year
2349858 we would really like to have lews opinion because hes familiar with tom
2349859 it provides a lot of hope for a lot of players
2349860 the golf course is so nasty right now just nasty
2349861 i dont know if there is such a thing as too hard this shouldnt be la la land for us out here its a major but my mind is still mushy i dont even know my name right now out there theres just so much going on with the course so much you have to deal with its going to get tougher and this course already is just so nasty so hard so tough
2349862 thats the truth i would tell you if i hit a bad putt but that stuff happens
2349863 we dont want rain but it would be easier for us to play with rain i dont think the course is difficult its difficult now because of where they put the pins some of the pins its like miniature golf out there there are some mounds that they put them right in between and its just up over one and down another and its tough
2349864 it tests every single part of your game im not complaining majors should be tough tests
2349865 is just tricky there is going to be a lot of complaining
2349866 there are a lot of holes out here that are almost unplayable
2349867 they are a little ridiculous i dont think its real fair when you hit good shots and in some cases you get penalized for them
2349868 i dont know about out of control but its about as tough as you could ever want to play it
2349869 off the tee its more of a u s open than a pga championship the green complexes are so severe that youre almost being tested on every shot that you hit theres no letup
2349870 you dont have to like it theres nothing against that
2349871 youve just got to accept the holes for what they are and try hard on every shot and try to you know hit every shot to the best of your ability
2349872 im glad to get out of there with what i did my short game was unbelievable i made a lot of great up and downs which you need to do when things are so brutal

2349922 the conference has been a good opportunity to propose different political and financial approaches to the problem of aids but it has lacked concrete action on the issues of exactly what to do and how
2349923 the conference is such a huge event that at times one cant see the complexity the number of relationships that people make and the commitments that are made sometimes we arent able to take in all the information about what is going on
2349924 this historic agreement demonstrates the level of commitment in the region and it is the communitys responsibility to engage in social oversight to ensure that the agreement is fulfilled
2349925 those most at risk including intravenous drug users men who have sex with men and sex workers must participate in public policy making the point is that greater participation of these groups in their own countries should come out of this conference because no one knows more about the problem than they do
2349926 the community of governments international agencies and ngos has been strengthened by the conference we have seen leaders make political commitments
2349927 my assessment of the conference is that it was very positive for mexico and for latin america as a whole in mexico the media coverage was so overwhelming that no campaign that we could launch would have achieved such a level of penetration
2349928 but above and beyond than mexico the situation of latin america was highlighted because the epidemic in our region is normally overlooked and that means the rest of the world does not pay it much attention or give it priority
2349929 we will not let the discussions remain empty words we are committed to following up the points expressed here
2349930 these conferences are not attended by decision makers with the authority to sign official agreements except in this case the regions health and education ministers the rest of the people who participated in this conference come out of a need to learn and share experiences we hope that many of the recommendations made here will be taken up by the countries represented

2349932 it certainly wasnt what i had been expecting and im just glad i got there first before my kids decided to take a look
2349933 i cant believe this leaflet even got to the stage of being printed and posted through peoples doors did nobody check it at any stage of the process
2349934 its very embarrassing hopefully not too many people will try to visit the site were looking at ways of preventing this type of thing happening in the future
2349935 delisting will maintain jobs and keep pdc financially strong were taking the waste out of peoria county were doing what you wanted you should support that
2349936 no delistings follow this model with multiple things going to many landfills i dont want to write off the jobs and profits but if peoria county wants to use waste policy for economic development there are other ways to do it
2349937 a grand experiment taking this dust and putting it into municipal landfills has never been tested instead of putting waste into the ground think of ways to recycle oppose the delisting
2349938 in a time of universal deceit telling the truth is a revolutionary act
2349939 i found that to tell the truth is the hardest thing on earth harder than fighting in a war harder than taking part in a revolution
2349940 the new black monochrome car is bad and it looks even better when its out in the sun and on the car with a our black wheels
2349941 you never know when a good idea and a good computer rendering are going to look as good in real life or look ridiculous but this car is just plain cool looking
2349942 on the first run we saw car after car smoke the tires and all the crew chiefs on all the teams were scrambling back to change the set ups after they saw the guys ahead of them because of that each pair seemed to make it a little bit farther and by the time we ran we had pushed the power out about as far as we thought we could and made it down there past where anyone else had gone you just knew though that our run was the one that would show the rest of the crew chiefs what was out there so we ended up 5th but that was pretty good because it put us farther back in the line tonight we werent sure how brave to be right up until ashley force ran a 4 11 a couple pairs ahead of us in our lane so we put it back to the aggressive set up and it went right down there the lap itself was just beautiful pretty much right down the middle
2349943 the jegs com cobalt went nice and straight both runs which is exactly what we like to see i think we all wanted a tick or two more in q2 there but we werent quite as efficient as we needed to be in the first few feet of the run after that it hustled down through there perfectly
2349944 the weather was perfect for us today there was some nice cloud cover and that helped us all run big numbers im looking at the qualifying sheet and were all packed in there close within a few hundredths of a second so the dogfight continues
2349945 its exciting to have the chance to secure our spot in the countdown field this weekend because it will give us a chance to catch our breath a bit and get ready for that six race run to the championship
2349946 in reality you cant ever let up out here but it will be nice to take that next step and know were in the race for sure its just like qualifying for race day every weekend you always feel better after you know youre in
2349947 now our peacekeepers are waging a fierce battle with regular forces from the georgian army in the southern region of ossetian capital tskhinvali

2349949 if the whole world does not stop russia today then russian tanks will be able to reach any other european capital
2349950 it takes quite a bit to upset me but once im going im gone it was a matter of doing the right thing
2349951 he comes across as a very professional very determined very dedicated police officer he wants things to be done the right way
2349952 we taught him to get the facts straight know the reality and then dont be afraid to take a stand and dont be afraid to stand alone
2349953 it just had a feeling of kind of a small community
2349954 it is really convenient weve got really nice grocery stores dry cleaners coffee places and pizza places its not unusual for my husband and me to walk up to get dinner there are concerts in the summer
2349955 hiking and biking trails are even bigger now people also want active parks for ball games and outdoor play and a lot of places to meet and greet
2349956 when we design a lot of our interior trail systems we include destinations so you can walk down the trail a quarter of the way and then theres something there like an art object or a field of grass where you can throw a frisbee or play with your dog
2349957 they want places for their teenagers to hang out and places for garden clubs and bridge clubs to hang out
