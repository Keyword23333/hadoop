4680027 lo patol gico es el nivel de frustraci n y ansiedad del menor cuando no puede usar el ordenador o la consola el placer del juego es para l una necesidad imperiosa algo rentable que le sirve para mitigar el sufrimiento y la soledad
4680028 no hay que adjudicar a los chicos toda la responsabilidad los padres tambi n tendr n que interrogarse qu pautas est n transmitiendo a los ni os

4680041 energy producers and meter companies must collaborate with the electricity company of ghana to help the ordinary ghanaian to benefit

4680148 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4680149 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4680150 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4680151 both sides are pulling out their troops and we expect this to be done before sunset today
4680152 everyone looks happy to see the thai troops leaving the area villagers are going back to run their businesses near preah vihear temple

4680158 there is no limit to what a man can do so long as he does not care a straw who gets the credit for it
4680159 it is individuality which is the original and eternal within man personality doesnt matter so much to pursue the education and development of this individuality as ones highest vocation would be a divine egoism

4680163 if sometimes our poor people have had to die of starvation it is not that god didnt care for them but because you and i didnt give were not an instrument of love in the hands of god to give them that bread to give them that clothing because we did not recognize him when once more christ came in distressing disguise in the hungry man in the lonely man in the homeless child and seeking for shelter
4680164 life is a voyage the winds of life come strong from every point yet each will speed thy course along if thou with steady hand when tempests blow canst keep thy course aright and never once let go
4680165 truth is its justices handmaid freedom is its child peace is its companion safety walks in its steps victory follows in its train it is the brightest emanation from the gospel it is the attribute of god
4680166 life is not precious a thing to be cherished the soul and the mind are the instruments god gives us for our use and half of us dont begin to use them we put life and health on two little pedestals and spend most of our time performing acts of devotion before them instead of using them as a carpenter his tools as a helmsman the rudder to hammer or steer our way to victory we turn ourselves into vestal virgins with nothing on the face of the earth to do but to feed the feeble flames of our comfort life is no craven thing lurking coward like in a corner it is big broad splendid in opportunity it is to be used not cherished it is to be spent not saved
4680167 then said jesus father forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his raiment and cast lots
4680168 peace is a militant thing any peace movement must have behind it a higher passion than the desire for war no one can be a pacifist without being ready to fight for peace and die for peace

4680171 vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us
4680172 its true hard work never killed anybody but i figure why take the chance
4680173 i dont pity any man who does hard work worth doing i admire him i pity the creature who does not work at whichever end of the social scale he may regard himself as being
4680174 i respect only those who resist me but i cannot tolerate them
4680175 this maiden she lived with no other thought than to love and be loved by me
4680176 making peace i have found is much harder than making war
4680177 here is a list of fearful things the jaws of sharks a vultures wings the rabid bite of the dogs of war the voice of one who went before but most of all the mirrors gaze which counts us out our numbered days
4680178 friends serve central functions for children that parents do not and they play a critical role in shaping childrens social skills and their sense of identity the difference between a child with close friendships and a child who wants to make friends but is unable to can be the difference between a child who is happy and a child who is distressed in one large area of life

4680181 my mind lets go a thousand things like dates of wars and deaths of kings
4680182 we are only what we are not what we would be nor every thing we hope for we are but a step in a scale that reaches further above us than below
4680183 i and the public know what all schoolchildren learn those to whom evil is done do evil in return
4680184 death is the sound of distant thunder at a picnic
4680185 ignore death up to the last moment then when it cant be ignored any longer have yourself squirted full of morphine and shuffle off in a coma
4680186 a song is no song unless the circumstance is free and fine if a singer sing from a sense of duty or from seeing no way to escape i had rather have none those only can sleep who do not care to sleep and those only write or speak best who do not too much respect the writing or the speaking
4680187 in song and dance man expresses himself as a member of a higher community he has forgotten how to walk and speak and is on the way toward flying up into the air dancing
4680188 a song is no song unless the circumstance is free and fine if a singer sing from a sense of duty or from seeing no way to escape i had rather have none those only can sleep who do not care to sleep and those only write or speak best who do not too much respect the writing or the speaking

4680190 the mysterious is the source of all true art and science
4680191 i see the world gradually being turned into a wilderness i hear the ever approaching thunder which will destroy us too i can feel the sufferings of millions and yet if i look up into the heavens i think that it will all come right that this cruelty too will end and that peace and tranquility will return again
4680192 there is more truth in honest lies believe me than in half the truths
4680193 tv gives everyone an image but radio gives birth to a million images in a million brains
4680194 what is important for kids to learn is that no matter how much money they have earn win or inherit they need to know how to spend it how to save it and how to give it to others in need this is what handling money is about and this is why we give kids an allowance
4680195 its true hard work never killed anybody but i figure why take the chance
4680196 this searching and doubting and vacillating where nothing is clear but the arrogance of quest i too had such noble ideas when i was still a boy
4680197 i have been searching history to see if really a woman has any precedent to claim the right to have her rights and i am compelled to say that we men are not so much ahead of women after all and the only way we have kept our reputation up is by keeping her down and dont you forget it
4680198 life at its noblest leaves mere happiness far behind and indeed cannnot endure it happiness is not the object of life life has no object it is an end in itself and courage consists in the readiness to sacrifice happiness for an intenser quality of life
4680199 friendship mysterious cement of the soul sweetener of life and solder of society

4680229 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4680230 to begin repairing relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must respect the freedom of its neighbors
4680231 we are hopeful that we can continue cooperation with the russians and thats across the board but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future right now their actions have been inconsistent with the fundamental principles of a europe whole free and at peace so cooperation on a wide range of issues going forward depends on the actions that russia takes

4680264 there were people at capcom who told me not to make this game
4680265 i didnt have a whole lot of success with my putting though
4680266 they made some changes with the course the rough was a lot deeper they sped up the greens and narrowed the fairways you just have to make adjustments
4680267 we played fairly early so there wasnt a lot of other people out there it got a lot busier later in the day but it was cool for my first event

4680272 its miranda i live here on the top floor you can come and visit me anytime
4680273 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4680274 i thought i lost the race but i guess that half stroke i mean im really sort of at a loss for words
4680275 relief excitement everything i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the 1 was next to my name thats when i sort of let out my roar
4680276 one one hundreth of a second is the most difficult loss you can have especially at the olympics
4680277 i did see the replays but if youre asking if im disappointed its a complete miracle to me that im here i retired a year and a half ago and came back to swimming thinking i was good enough to compete at this level so im enjoying this
4680278 i wish i was the gold medalist but ill take the silver medal and im very comfortable with this
4680279 i have once again become a medium of violence in the world
4680280 inflicted by an evil demon that is nurtured by our so called
4680281 i dont know what god wants for me i just dont know
4680282 help they kidnapped me they wont let me go home or nothing
4680283 det er lidt uvirkeligt at jeg nu har vundet en medalje men det er det hele v rdi det synes jeg altid at det er om det s er en personlig rekord eller en medalje det er bare det bedste i mit liv tror jeg
4680284 det var fantastisk jeg h ber at jeg en dag kommer til at st verst men i dag var det fantastisk se de andre sv mmere og min familie mens jeg stod p skamlen
4680285 jeg havde et indtryk af at det var t t s jeg t nkte at jeg m tte l gge hovedet ned og bare tonse l s jeg havde en krise ved de 200 meter hvor jeg t nkte at der blev rykket h rdt men jeg kom op igen og t nkte ved de sidste 750 meter at det m tte b re eller briste
4680286 jeg kan godt se mig selv ved ol om fire r jeg er kun 20 r og jeg har masser af r i mig i endnu mener jeg jeg m bare arbejde h rdere og s h ber jeg p en s lv eller guldmedalje
4680287 hey mom we won medals today but what did you win
4680288 i did win today i had the pleasure of watching the two of you happily ride around all day and win medals for being two of the most determined young riders here thats all i need to be a winner
4680289 to have it concentrated so much in one county its almost unheard of
4680290 hopefully you will accept that the prosecution is also meant to be neutral and that is something you cannot be as the alleged victim
4680291 that tends to conflict with your assertion we are all grasses
4680292 ultimately any proof you have of bad deeds by individual tp members should be presented to someone neutral
4680293 anyways proof of one bad deed does not necessarily prove another bad deed
4680294 again a purely personal point of view here is that if what you allege has some truth to it i think you should take it up with the individuals or take it to the police
4680295 it was the police who informed me you have police informers
4680296 if you have a problem with members of an affinity group why paint us all with the same lurid brush
4680297 but you make some very serious allegations which are way beyond my competence to deal with
4680298 danny i have not claimed you are lying except with regard to some comments you have made about me
4680299 all i have said is that my experience within tp and with tp people conflicts with what you claim are your experiences
4680300 i am absolutely certain the over whelming majority of tp members would be glad to have any police informants or worse amongst us exposed for what they are
4680301 i understand you possess the technical wizardry to do this
4680302 i was not so much smearing you as a nazi
4680303 i know he is anti hippy and anti tp that is all i know
4680304 it rather patronising for you to describe the older tpers as greyhaired and bluerinsed saints
4680305 john you did say you werent speaking for tp i thought i should point that out again since even by tp standards i find your views discreditable to tp a casual reader may mistake your antipathy to antifascism as typical of tp it would be yet another moral and intellectual mistake for tp to try to confuse my criticism of tp with your personal critique of antifascism
4680306 so damn blast the whole organisation that seems intellectually sound not
4680307 i trust anyone who bothers to actually read this shit will note i said nothing of the sort
4680308 again all i tried to do was call into question your assertion that
4680309 besides arent exclusions and censorship the preserves of erm fascism
4680310 not everything i say and do relates to tp danny i have a mind of my own and need
4680311 now i have told you a couple of times now that i am in no position to be tps advocate here in order to play your odd games
4680312 my girlfriend who is far saner and intelligent than the two of us combined has already advised me to stop wasting my time responding to your digs
4680313 if you have serious allegations to make about tp or rather the odd individual involved in it then make them to someone who can do something about it ever tried one of the activist mediation groups
4680314 as you say youre smarter than me in which case you do not need me to work through your issues with tp hippies peace groups and non violence
4680315 we would have let the less cute girl appear on television
4680316 when people say theres no such thing as a stupid question theyre lying there will always be stupid questions
4680317 dreaming permits each and every one of us to be quietly and safely insane every night of our lives

4680337 clinging to his faith jacob disputes it as well here is one of his tortured arguments with himself
4680338 no who else is there is this the devils work
4680339 it is the problem of belief how to reconcile god with evil onan carries it further in jacob he has the believer torn he has god as well struggling in despair with the same problem

4680343 i am primarily a realist and hope to show great empathy for my people without softening the difficult situations they find themselves in yet my work inevitably veers into the cruel and the sentimental it is extreme fiction masquerading behind the guise of mainstream realism
4680344 the whole idea of penance is selfish misguided you cant bargain with god buy him with pieties this is what youve found out that even with the best intentions even with all of your thoughtful sermons and deep feelings and good works you cant save anyone least of all yourself and yet its not defeat after everything you may still be saved your mother was wrong its not up to you its always been his decision

4680346 if you save wisdom until the world is wise the world will never have it
4680347 but why must it all be acted again the answer was near at hand there was still the serpent whispering
4680348 pains the only evil i know about society is the only thing which determines whether an act is wrong or not
4680349 how did those two heresies get back into the world after all this time hell has limited imaginations down there
4680350 sincere that was the hell of it perhaps satan was the sincerest of the lot
4680351 it the world never was any better it never will be any better it will only be richer or poorer sadder but not wiser until the very last day
4680352 why do you wish to discredit the past even to dehumanizing the last civilization so that you need not learn from their mistakes or can it be that you cant bear being only a rediscoverer and must feel that you are a creator as well

4680356 if these reports are accurate these russian actions would represent a dramatic and brutal escalation of the conflict in georgia russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatened a government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century russias government must respect georgias territorial integrity and sovereignty russias government must reverse the course that it appears to be on as a first step toward resolving this conflict russias actions this week have raised serious questions about its intentions in georgia and the region

4680401 news organizations often work with and assist other news organizations on these types of stories but no contact information about any source was provided without permission of that person
4680402 there is no evidence that any news agency had acted inappropriately

4680426 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4680427 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4680428 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4680429 jika ada orang yang mengatakan sebelumnya bahwa saya akan memenangkan dua emas dan memecahkan rekor dunia saya akan menertawainya saya tidak pernah berpikir tentang itu

4680431 irans continued attempts to conduct prohibited proliferation related activity and terrorist financing
4680432 the fact is that the iranian banks have never been involved in any illicit activities including in non peaceful nuclear activities simply because there are no such non peaceful nuclear activities in iran
4680433 the attempt of the three countries to seek the restriction of the activities of the iranian banks is intended not only to exert undue pressure on the iranian government but also to disrupt the banking and financial affairs of millions of deposit holders and customers of those banks
4680434 neither of the grounds put forward by the district court grounds which have been loosely characterized as government deception and outrageous conduct supports the drastic remedy of dismissal of the indictment

4680442 our reporter believed he was dealing with another reporter and later shared contact information that he thought could help shed more light on a story that has had great public interest
4680443 news organizations often work with and assist other news organizations on these types of stories but no contact information about any source was provided without permission of that person
4680444 there is no evidence that any news agency had acted inappropriately
4680445 this case has not been jeopardized im confident that no documents have been released
4680446 el convenio del fideicomiso pasa por encima de los acuerdos del congreso general ordinario de los trabajadores que es la m xima autoridad del sindicato
4680447 existen alrededor de 30 maestros en la zona sur que han sido despedido injustamente y a nivel estatal son 130 los trabajadores a los que han violentado sus salarios sin haber un acuerdo de terminaci n en las instancias que mandan el contrato colectivo
4680448 el rector lo va a implementar el descuento del fideicomiso desacatando la resoluci n que tiene con nosotros como sindicato un total de 11 mil trabajadores si vamos a aportar al fideicomiso pero antes de que se inicie el descuento del 3 por ciento del salario base tenemos que conocer el reglamento normas legales jur dicas para el manejo del fondo
4680449 debe haber un consejo t cnico de administraci n los trabajadores no hemos participado en qui nes nos van a representar ah aun no tenemos conocimiento que se haya formado el consejo y el descuento se va a aplicar a partir del 15 de este mes
4680450 despu s de la tormenta el gobierno disolvi la junta educativa del distrito despidieron a todos los maestros organizados en sindicatos y la secretar a de educaci n del presidente george w bush puso 24 millones de d lares para las escuelas cuasi privadas del movimiento ch rter
4680451 hoy para proveer seguridad a muchas escuelas hay agentes de seguridad privada que son provistos por la empresa blackwater la misma que ofrece seguridad a funcionarios en iraq
4680452 la ofensiva de las corporaciones contra las escuelas p blicas
4680453 la educaci n p blica es muy similar a la atenci n m dica una necesidad humana que ya est altamente privatizada en estados unidos para la atenci n m dica el crecimiento de las hmos hospital maintenance organizations fue resultado de su privatizaci n corporativa
4680454 esto signific que el gobierno renunci a toda responsabilidad para proporcionar un servicio de calidad esa responsabilidad se transfiri a las empresas m dicas
4680455 el papel del gobierno es simplemente recaudar impuestos que son remitidos a esas corporaciones empresariales para cubrir costos m dicos y obtener un alto nivel de ganancia
4680456 ello ha tra do consigo que la bolsa de valores en wall street vea la atenci n m dica simplemente como un paquete de oportunidades de inversi n lo cual ha minado gravemente la calidad del servicio esta es la direcci n empresarial que est n siguiendo las escuelas p blicas
4680457 la privatizaci n de la educaci n p blica est siguiendo el est mulo de la ganancia en el mismo sentido que la atenci n m dica
4680458 en ese amparo estamos pidiendo la no aplicaci n del convenio signado entre rodrigo lucas y el rector que nos modifica la cl usula 86 8 para el personal en activo y tambi n por la grabaci n al salario para el descuento del fideicomiso por la forma tan alevosa e irregular que se hizo
4680459 con ella estar amos pidiendo la nulidad de ese convenio y la reparaci n de da os y perjuicios que se cometieron producto de ese convenio en contra de los trabajadores
4680460 es nuestro salario no podemos nosotros darnos el lujo de que nos est n quitando en nuestra cara nuestro salario y no nos dispongamos cuando menos a decir a donde llevas el dinero o que piensas hacer con el en ese sentido nosotros estaremos pidiendo que suspendan eso
4680461 entre el congreso y nosotros siempre ha habido comunicaci n en esta ocasi n no se nos llam para aclarar por lo tanto actuaron pol ticamente para allegarse de las simpat as de los campesinos por intereses personales les recuerdo que la uas en su historia siempre ha apoyado este tipo de causas pero sin cobrar
4680462 el problema es que se suben a la tribuna en el congreso para prejuzgar a la uas y al rector comentando que somos represores sin tener los elemento de juicio para ello y eso es muy temerario
4680463 un posicionamiento partidista que por supuesto el congreso no suscribe ni tampoco la mayor a del pri
4680464 porque a cambio hemos recibido tambi n respeto es un trato sin agresiones sin diferendos
4680465 el rector tiene abiertas las puertas del congreso para acudir cuantas veces quiera
4680466 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4680467 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4680468 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4680469 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4680470 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4680471 im just a girl thats all that youll let me be
4680472 each persons level 1 residuals may be autocorrelated and heteroscedastic over time any unexplained person specific time invariant effect in the residuals will create a correlation across occasions
4680473 it goes on for seven to 10 minutes at a time
4680474 its obviously not a good picture and we hope it will be better during the second half of the year
4680475 how are we going to manage the cash flows that are coming out
4680476 considering where were at in the global economy i think weve all struggled our pension fund included
4680477 i dont know that the market will ensure success or failure
4680478 a great performance still isnt going to get us out of our problem
4680479 would it be wise to start thinking about having a negotiating stance in our union contracts that were willing to pay a little more on the salary side if theyre willing to give something up on the pension side
4680480 the problem is that these areas are rural and spread out and the income levels of the people are not high enough to afford the costs
4680481 there might be a good well and three houses down theres a bad well
4680482 were working with communities the county commissioners and state reps
4680483 its an enormous problem the way the government is structured
4680484 if we never get together and talk about it theres chaos
4680485 one thing ive learned about infrastructure you move one step at a time
4680486 no one gives directions like turn right here go left there everyone knows where to go from the chick n dip
4680487 people like being able to come to a place like this because there arent many around
4680488 people enjoy it its not contrite or part of a chain or a box store
4680489 there has been very little remodeling since the day it was built
4680490 some people would think of it as an indictment but then others have paid thousands of dollars to get that vintage feel
4680491 when it first opened this was the place to go for chicken
4680492 they have the best chicken and coleslaw its the food that keeps us coming back

4680496 the fact that you argue that they may not be able to prove their charges does not warrant their dismissal
4680497 its a job that takes you away from home so much

4680500 were pumped to bring exciting updates on the upcoming open world mafia game the godfather ii weve got some great exclusive looks at eas star wars the force unleashed
4680501 most people who play xbox live arcade games dont generally agree with the mainstream reviews that are written about these games
4680502 if the legislation is set in a way that is favourable to higher quality operators and higher quality casinos like in lithuania then public opinion about gaming tends to be more positive if the regulations are more positive towards small locations and a big number of operators then it tends towards lower quality of which the classic example is latvia where there are approximately 600 casinos including slot casinos about half of those are in riga which definitely i think is too many you only have to walk around riga to see this it causes public opinion to turn against casinos operators need to be regulated and there needs to be transparency in the casino business
4680503 currently it is entirely up to every member state to regulate
4680504 the european commission tried to put it into a service directive but it was taken out if i had to make an estimate i would say that in 15 or 20 years there will be a unified gaming law in europe
4680505 people still go into casinos but they do not spend as much time there
4680506 also the average bet is smaller than it used to be so people are much more cautious definitely we can feel the slowdown in the economy and this slowdown seems to be much deeper than previous ones
4680507 the previous boom was generated not so much by increased productivity or the normal forces of economic growth but because people were really spending their assets now that its dropped off the effect is very sharp and severe
4680508 we would like to enter that line of business in europe there are many hotels which have casinos but not really any casino resorts other than one operating in slovenia near the border with italy

4680512 for assets in individual retirement accounts described in section 408 or 408a of the internal revenue code of 1986 other than a simplified employee pension under section 408 k of such code or a simple retirement account under section 408 p of such code the aggregate value of such assets exempted under this section without regard to amounts attributable to rollover contributions under section 402 c 402 e 6 403 a 4 403 a 5 and 403 b 8 of the internal revenue code of 1986 and earnings thereon shall not exceed 1 000 000 in a case filed by a debtor who is an individual except that such amount may be increased if the interests of justice so require

4680519 controversial relationship with hitlers government has led some to label him a nazi collaborator and war criminal
4680520 it has been proved to us that the mufti too aimed at the implementation of the final solution viz the extermination of european jewry
4680521 conflicting interpretations have portrayed him as an instigator against the jews and british or an opponent of violence as a means of achieving arab aims
4680522 at his first meeting with hitler on november 28 the mufti tried unsuccessfully to secure a public axis declaration favoring arab independence he helped recruit the 13
4680523 the mufti himself acknowledged that at that time it was only due to the german funds he received that it had been possible to carry through the uprising in palestine
4680524 to discuss the issue of transporting weapons to the arab insurgents
4680525 it has been proved to us that the mufti too aimed at the implementation of the final solution viz the extermination of european jewry
4680526 the mufti had repeatedly suggested to the various authorities with whom he was maintaining contact above all to hitler ribbentrop and himmler the extermination of european jewry and had been a collaborator and advisor of eichmann and himmler in the execution of this plan he was one of eichmanns best friends and had constantly incited him to accelerate the extermination measures
4680527 the phrase used by hitler in this conversation vernichtung des judentums is one that was used in connection with the holocaust
4680528 the mufti of jerusalem haj amin el husseini and national socialism
4680529 to prevent the jews from emigrating from your country and send them somewhere they will be under strict control for example to poland
4680530 although there was ample proof to arrest him as a war criminal after the war the allies made not effort to do so they were deterred by husseinis prestige in the arab world in 1946 yugoslavia indicted him for war crimes and asked for his extradition but the allies were afraid of the storm in the arab world if the hero of arab nationalism was treated as a war criminal
4680531 by far the most committed supporter of national socialism in the arab and islamic world
4680532 he rejected the 1947 u n partition plan and the establishment of israel in 78 percent of mandatory palestine thereafter
4680533 the muslim brothers cleared the way for the second career of the mufti whose pro nazi past they considered a source of pride
4680534 between 1945 and 1948 islamism received its most important boost when the allied victors considered their good relations with the arab world more important than countering the ideological concoctions of antisemitism hitler worship holocaust denial and the unbridled desire to destroy israel of which the mufti was the supreme component the islamism of the 21 st century remains marked by the connections with nazism

4680557 debate abierto pues sus resultados no se han traducido en acciones que concreten una pol tica educativa integral al percibirse como herramienta para determinar responsabilidades ante los bajos resultados acad micos pero no para construir soluciones

4680559 maquillar el creciente abandono por parte del estado de la escuela p blica sin que se asuma que los resultados son generados por diversos factores incluidos los que est n fuera del aula y de la escuela
4680560 siempre existe el riesgo de que la pol tica en la materia se concentre a la implementaci n de pruebas pero luego no se instrumenten acciones concretas para enfrentar y resolver los problemas que las mismas ponen de manifiesto
4680561 toda la responsabilidad para la soluci n de los problemas detectados a escuelas y familias otras veces se atribuye a los docentes quienes por su parte tienden a transferir la responsabilidad a los padres y al contexto

4680616 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4680617 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4680618 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4680619 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4680620 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4680621 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4680622 we zijn heel dankbaar voor de steun die we hebben gekregen van mensen in peking de verenigde staten en vanover de hele wereld
4680623 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4680624 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4680625 frente a la situaci n de nuestro werken preso pol tico mapuche jos huenchunao mari an recluido en la c rcel de angol cumpliendo una condena de 10 a os por el caso poluco pidenco queremos anunciar y denunciar lo siguiente
4680626 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4680627 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4680628 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4680629 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4680630 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4680631 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4680632 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4680633 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia
4680634 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables
4680635 cuando fui militar dirig un grupo donde el 80 y 90 eran de origen mapuche y que ten a las mejores relaciones con ellos y record que adem s en la cabecera de su escritorio ten a un retrato de lautaro
4680636 magn fica demostraci n de la incapacidad de di logo de los estudiantes de chile
4680637 igual de vehemente de apasionado de arriesgado en la defensa de sus err neos principios pol ticos su padre me explic ella era militante de la ultraderecha de sus d as
4680638 y de inmediato la sentencia de expulsi n quedar sin efecto
4680639 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4680640 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4680641 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4680642 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4680643 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4680644 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas
4680645 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4680646 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4680647 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n
4680648 quer an informaci n del grupo lautaro porque dec an que los militares quer an matarlos mas vale que nosotros los ayudemos en la c rcel estar n mejor que muertos les respond que no pod a ayudarlos y tuve mucho miedo
4680649 todo el mundo sospechaba que todo el mundo era sapo dividieron para gobernar
4680650 negociaciones con la dictadura como la salida de presos pol ticos mientras pinochet quedaba impune
4680651 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4680652 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4680653 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4680654 por un mundo sano convocada por la conferencia de religiosos y religiosas conferre de la di cesis de copiap
4680655 la votaci n de este domingo fue el mayor desaf o que ha enfrentado la gesti n de morales
4680656 para ser confirmado en su cargo el presidente necesita un m nimo del 53 7 de los sufragios el porcentaje que logr en las elecciones de 2005 mientras que los prefectos deben obtener la mitad m s uno de los votos
4680657 tambi n fueron confirmados en sus puestos cinco de los ocho prefectos que se sometieron a la votaci n mientras tres deber n abandonar sus labores
4680658 la historia dice que barrick ayud y respet cada pulgada de los cr menes en toronto el 7 de mayo de 2008 cuando me encontr con los ejecutivos de barrick qued confiado en que la gerencia har todo lo posible para suprimir las matanzas en el sitio de la mina de porgera hab amos convenido en iniciar un di logo pero a n antes de comenzar las matanzas y las muertes que ocurren en el sitio de la mina est n aumentando
4680659 nuestras investigaciones han establecido que el personal de seguridad de barrick ingres a las aldeas locales usando rifles de alta potencia tipo m16 y dispararon contra los pobladores inofensivos
4680660 la gente ha hecho quitar todos de sus huertas y jardines ahora est viviendo al lado de la descarga de residuos de la mina y buscan el oro ya que no tiene ninguna otra manera de ganarse la vida
4680661 esta situaci n est alcanzando su punto de crisis y barrick gold no est tomando ninguna acci n responsable la soluci n es clara las situaciones econ micas y sociales de la gente local rodeadas por la basura y la contaminaci n atmosf rica son atroces
4680662 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4680663 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4680664 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4680665 i know its expensive and its really just a show for other people we already know that were committed to each other
4680666 you know i was thinking that if we ever did get engaged i dont want a big fancy ring it costs so much and we could use that money to do something fun together instead
4680667 i am pleased that we at smith midland have been able to achieve six consecutive profitable quarters despite the pressures of increasing raw material and fuel costs
4680668 the company has record level production backlog heading into the second half of the year and the company is looking at various options to deal with the increasing steel costs and fuel surcharges
4680669 i have been observing halcyons progress as a director and am impressed by the strong franchise it has built in a short period of time
4680670 as the new chairman i look forward to helping the management team build on its successes which have resulted in significant revenue growth i would also like to wish mitch well in his future endeavors
4680671 i look forward to capitalizing on the numerous opportunities for growth
4680672 halcyon has built a well deserved reputation for providing discerning travelers with a unique luxury travel experience and i look forward to leading the company through its next phase of growth
4680673 we spent much of the first six months of 2008 overcoming significant operational hurdles many of which were outside of our control
4680674 we have now successfully done so and our results beginning in may reflect the initial traction we have worked so hard to achieve we anticipated a slight seasonal slowdown in july but were pleased to see sequential increases in both new accounts and the number of trades executed we believe that the pending launch of our third party data feed will help us continue and likely accelerate this growth rate
4680675 when youre down there in the trenches you see things that make you think this doesnt need to be done this way
4680676 if a guy did it he did it and needs to be done in for it
4680677 were not this blue brotherhood of the past where everyone turns their heads times have changed technology captures everything everything you say is recorded every stop you make is videotaped
4680678 if youre out there working and doing your job youre going to get complaints
4680679 have i been through the system ive had false complaints filed against me absolutely
4680680 you put on a mask and you become somebody different
4680681 the mask represents your character your whole persona its hard to explain i guess its like a little kid when he puts his costume on for halloween
4680682 every time i go out they boo louder for me and cheer louder for the other guy
4680683 right next to the ring i have a trampoline so i can practice my aerial maneuvers
4680684 the champ didnt even know he was going to win
4680685 he was the one of the best men i ever met
4680686 jerry wexler was always there for me i wouldnt have had a career if it wasnt for him
4680687 he believed in me he thought my voice was different from other artists at the time he was just so different from other people in the music world he could hear things that other producers couldnt hear
4680688 he said to me little girl im checking out he knew he was ready to go
4680689 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4680690 and i dont know whether it was prescient or whether i was indulging in favoritism
4680691 but i gave them terrific reviews because i thought they were great records so we sort of bonded
4680692 we got to know each other because we were both collectors of old jazz 78s
4680693 we were obsessed with it we would go to the salvation army depots and old furniture stores and open old victrolas youd even go into basements past mad dogs sometimes to see if they had any old records there
4680694 i always love to tell stories and be the center of attention but not around jerry you wanted to take everything in he had firsthand knowledge of the music industry and how it all happened
4680695 and his memory was unbelievable he could tell you who played what instrument on an album 50 years ago it was uncanny
4680696 the last of the breed of the street smart but highly intellectual and creative producers whose passion for the music ruled everything
4680697 he brought her to superstardom and brought her back to her roots
4680698 a joy to work with great energy humor larger than life personality charming in that new york tough guy way with a heart of gold
4680699 florida is one of the states that has been most affected by the housing bubble that comes through loud and clear
4680700 in past business cycles weakness in the local economy would undermine the housing sector but in this case i think it is the other way around the housing bubble bringing down the economy
4680701 a lot of moms who used to send their kids to day care are staying home now because they have lost their jobs
4680702 theyre taking care of their kids so the whole combination is all blamed on the economy
4680703 it is not just the loss of jobs but the toll of inflation on everybodys pocketbook
4680704 your groceries have gone up your gas has gone up so you start trading it off should i cut my own grass or have somebody else cut my grass it is doing that in every community across the country
4680705 probably the most important thing for florida is that the national economy holds together
4680706 and i think it probably will but we are skating on thin ice now
4680707 he said were representing people who dont want to expose who they are at this point
4680708 i thought it was a bank going in or someone building offices and condos
4680709 they want a project they can be proud of too
4680710 they have not said no to a split facility if the stadium is located close to downtown
4680711 we didnt believe that number when we first hear it
4680712 we thought it was high then they showed us a deal directly across the street that went for 100 a foot
4680713 any other place it is up against neighbors or we have to displace 9 million in improvements to the park
4680714 i just moved here so obviously i dont want anything to happen im probably the only one who is against it
4680715 what prompted you to come with such and ingenious method of
4680716 there are disagreements and competing factors that need to be resolved it is premature to determine where the truth lies
4680717 a detailed analysis at the completion of the case will be made to decide which party should prevail
4680718 while the actions of the condominium association and its board of directors in refusing to pay the expenses of maintenance and repair which are clearly their legal obligation continue to pose a significant threat to the continued operation of the colony
4680719 management remains committed to exploring every viable means to preserve and maintain the colony as an operating resort and a valuable asset to the local community
4680720 from our point of view the court made the right decision
4680721 the idea that the residents would have to fund the operational costs of the resort at this time would obviously have been a bad result
4680722 estranho ela estava sempre l e desde anteontem que est tudo fechado
4680723 ficamos estupefatos quando soubemos o que tinha acontecido e retiramos logo a nossa filha de l
4680724 kauan olen istunut puutarhassa nyt vasta se kukkii kun juon on ter lehti kupissa tunnen k sill ni syksyn valon ja samassa on ilta n en pime n syk ht v n laajenevan auriga ajaa valaistua tiet t hdet loistavat ja himmenev t vai olivatko ne maan huokauksia kaikki joita t htientutkijat maalasivat taivaalle liian my h n niin kuin aina
4680725 luulin ett kuistille oli heitetty kirje mutta se oli vain kuun kajoa min poimin valoa lattialta miten kevyt se oli kuun kirje ja kaikki taipui kuin rauta tuolla puolen
4680726 villisorsa huutaa ja aamulla ruoho on kuurassa kuin lasia ohut hileinen ni ik vyyden huimaus on syksy min palelen tulen loimussakin kylmyys on ihon alla ei katoa
4680727 i think what do i want to be when i grow up
4680728 hello i havent given up the ghost or deserted yak attack ive been exploring b w s idea that if we stop growing were dead spending time with family reading books i normally wouldnt pick up doing yoga and remodeling
4680729 they got an old chimp from a collector or from a zoo or a failing circus or maybe they got a bear yeah a black bear
4680730 its a team effort against those two its going to have to be scott said
4680731 how exactly that works im not prepared to go into
4680732 its fair to say we wont expect one person to be doing the job on riewoldt the whole game
4680733 you need to help out riewoldts direct opponent because its too big a job for one guy
4680734 koschitzkes under a little bit of pressure due to a drop in form but we know hes a top line player when hes on his game
4680735 st kilda have copped a bit of criticism already this week and you always have got to be on guard and wary of that harvey said
4680736 specifically players that have been mentioned in the media from st kilda they are the ones you have to be very careful of because theyve got a lot of pride and they want to come out and prove everyone wrong
4680737 you go back and have a look at that game and see why they played badly harvey said
4680738 you dont try to emulate the way west coast play but you look at different areas of where you can possibly find that weakness
4680739 from castros cuba to the u s senate one mans pursuit of the american dream
4680740 i set out to write this book for my children and grandchildren and i studiously stayed away from that
4680741 i would hope this is a book can inspire young people particularly young people who are facing some hardship whether they be immigrants or in foster care
4680742 mr president during the time i am privileged to serve i would hope that i could have a voice on issues relating to cuba
4680743 mel will be able to have something to say on cuba
4680744 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4680745 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
4680746 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4680747 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4680748 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4680749 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4680750 community office hours events are an opportunity for residents to meet with members of my staff to work through specific questions or concerns involving federal programs caseworkers often help citizens gain hard to find information from federal agencies and access to their proper benefits
4680751 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
4680752 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
4680753 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4680754 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4680755 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4680756 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4680757 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4680758 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4680759 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4680760 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4680761 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4680762 just having one of those days yeah music you were playing really blew my mind do do do
4680763 no one lights a lamp and hides it in a jar or puts it under a bed instead he puts it on a stand so that those who come in can see the light
4680764 your time is limited so dont waste it living someone elses life dont be trapped by dogma which is living with the results of other peoples thinking dont let the noise of others opinions drown out your own inner voice and most important have the courage to follow your heart and intuition they somehow already know what you truly want to become everything else is secondary
4680765 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4680766 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4680767 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4680768 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4680769 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4680770 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4680771 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4680772 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4680773 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4680774 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4680775 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4680776 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4680777 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4680778 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4680779 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4680780 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4680781 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4680782 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4680783 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4680784 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4680785 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4680786 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4680787 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4680788 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4680789 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4680790 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4680791 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
4680792 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
4680793 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4680794 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4680795 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4680796 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4680797 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4680798 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4680799 when things fail think of homer it cant get any worse
4680800 indeed its true that few hours just zoomed past so quickly till it was time for love to book in seeing him just tying his shoelaces and all ready to leave again just made me so emotional cos i knew that its gonna be another long week again for me
4680801 jangan khawatir aku bisa meringankan kutukan penyihir jahat sang putri tidak akan wafat ia hanya akan tertidur selama 100 tahun setelah terkena jarum pemintal benang dan ia akan terbangun kembali setelah seorang pangeran datang padanya
4680802 jangan khawatir tuan putri hanya akan tertidur selama seratus tahun tapi ia tidak akan sendirian aku akan menidurkan kalian semua

4680808 wow i was thinking to myself who is that girl who keeps looking at me with the big face

4680816 oh so the names shorter thats why cheaper is it haha
4680817 the chief glory of every people arises from its authors
4680818 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4680819 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4680820 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4680821 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues

4680823 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4680824 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4680825 im probably the same age as you why are you acting like i hold all the strings
4680826 ianya suatu kebodohan dan lebih malang lagi melibatkan golongan yang memakai jenama islam
4680827 kita lihat bagaimana saiful bukhari mengangkat sumpah sehari sebelum anwar dinamakan sebagai calon
4680828 maka tidak syak lagi ia sememangnya bermotifkan politik kotor dan tidak bermoral
4680829 bahkan badan kehakiman membenarkan beliau bertanding di pilihan raya kecil permatang pauh
4680830 kita masih tetap menyokong anwar dan menyatakan bahawa beliau tidak bersalah
4680831 saya tidak merasakan begitu bahkan kemungkinan sokongan terhadap beliau bertambah itu ada
4680832 sekiranya terbukti berlaku pembohongan maka kesaksian individu tersebut sudah tidak dapat digunakan sampai bila bila
4680833 kemukakan empat orang saksi di mahkamah syariah jika tidak dapat mengemukakan empat saksi dakwaannya itu tidak benar dan ia wajar dihukum 80 kali rotan bukannya bersumpah di dalam masjid
4680834 saya dengar lafaz sumpahnya tadi apabila menonton televisyen berita jam 8
4680835 persoalannya kenapa di saat hari percalonan pilihanraya kecil permatang pauh baru saiful buat sumpah kenapa tidak dahulu lagi
4680836 apabila ianya dilakukan pada saat hari pencalonan pilihanraya kecil permatang pauh ianya dilihat sesuatu yang ada yang tidak kena agar sukar untuk kita katakan ianya tidak ada konspirasi untuk mengaib dan menjatuhkan karier politik orang yang dituduh anwar ibrahim katanya
4680837 bawa kes ini ke mahkamah syariah kemukakan empat orang saksi bukannya menghebahkan ke serata dunia dengan membuat sumpah di masjid
4680838 nabi muhamad s a w tidak pula aisyah bersumpah atau meminta safuan bersumpah

4680849 but more often concern about his emerging overconfidence which is making it difficult to interact with him
4680850 you get a sense they are concerned that the al maliki regime has an inflated sense of his power
4680851 he is successfully fashioning himself as an iraqi hero who kicked the americans out that makes him difficult to negotiate with
4680852 theres even some evidence that al maliki wants to start a fight with the sons of iraq
4680853 al maliki doesnt believe he has to accommodate these people he will only do it if we twist his arm to the breaking point
4680854 if the negotiations crash and burn i will be forced to pull out all us troops by jan 1

4680867 we want television screens in the west to be showing not only russian tanks and texts saying russia is at war in south ossetia and with georgia but also to be showing the suffering of the ossetian people the murdered elderly people and children the destroyed towns of south ossetia and regional capital tskhinvali this would be an objective way of presenting the material
4680868 we have lived long but this is the noblest work of our whole lives it will transform vast solitudes into thriving districts the united states take rank this day among the first powers of the earth
4680869 the fault dear brutus is not in our stars but in ourselves that we are underlings

4680877 victoria way is an important scheme for the towns future growth both in terms of providing a much needed transport route to access the railway station and as an alternative to using elwick road but also to enable the redevelopment of derelict land to the south of the railway
4680878 we are very pleased this has been recognised by the government and it means we are an important step closer to receiving the funding needed to deliver the scheme
4680879 the schemes shortlisted for the next stage in bidding for 200 million of funding have shown that they can help unlock potential in proposed new developments as well as provide the transport infrastructure to support growing communities and improve access to town centres and jobs
4680880 we produce 300 tonnes of manure from our poultry operation per year and we spread the whole lot in one afternoon
4680881 this is a normal agricultural activity i have spoken to the environmental health office and explained the situation they are happy as long as i keep them informed
4680882 mr wanstall was advised it was essential that he integrate the poultry manure with the soil as soon as possible which he agreed to do
4680883 many farmers use a variety of material at this time of the year including paper residue sewage sludge and poultry manure since it avoids using chemical fertiliser
4680884 theres no such thing as clean coal we dont need e on to keep the lights on by burning the planet we need an investment in renewables to meet our energy needs and keep the planet habitable
4680885 the climate camp was just the beginning if kingsnorth gets the go ahead people across the uk are committed to stopping it from being built
4680886 its been a great result today but a real victory for us will be when we have conclusively scuppered e ons coal fuelled mania
4680887 if the government give the green light to this power plant e on can expect to be seeing a lot more of us in the future
4680888 its the lack of control and the process as a whole that i object to the government have got it into their heads that we need more houses but i simply dont think thats the case
4680889 its like the old style soviet way of doing things you plan it and you do it regardless of the circumstances its not good for the countryside and its not good for the country
4680890 if we are to protect our countryside and have something to pass on its important
4680891 but how do you challenge projected population figures canterbury council dont have the resources to carry out our own survey
4680892 i have a letter from the council warning me that i cant make changes to the appearance of my house because they consider the area to be of special architectural or historic interest and that it is important to preserve and enhance the appearance of conservation areas
4680893 how can they then consider 42ft high brick metal and glass modern office blocks as an appropriate development on the opposite side of the road i cant make sense of it
4680894 if the council grants permission for this development then no conservation area is safe
4680895 the right hand lane for traffic to turn right into upper harbledown accommodates five or six cars any more and traffic waiting to turn into the village will bring all through traffic to a halt
4680896 there is a great danger of houses being built without adequate water supplies
4680897 in addition the cabinet is highly concerned the additional infrastructure costs will eventually fall on the residents of kent through water rate increases which are adjudicated upon by ofwat
4680898 overall there appears to be a lack of co ordination between the water
4680899 thats because they use different data for their drought models
4680900 we are going to end up with solutions that are more expensive for customers and that put the environment at more risk all due to a lack of sharing of resources and of developing shared solutions to a common problem
4680901 we very much encourage the water companies to work together more to find the best overall shared solution to water resources
4680902 we have reviewed and thoroughly scrutinised the companies plans and
4680903 we expect them to fully consider the impact of development on people the environment and the economy
4680904 currently the companies are working with the ea ofwat and defra to derive a regional solution for the south east
4680905 this process has been in practice since 1997 and has been used to formulate regional strategies for the past 10 years
4680906 companies have the responsibility to provide secure and sustainable high quality water supplies to meet projected demand and each of the water companies
4680907 we note kccs call for a public inquiry but there is an established
4680908 plans are put out to public consultation with full participation by consumer

4680916 we wanna hear your music dude do something from black star or black on both sides what are you doing
4680917 we figured what the heck a box full of box
4680918 don told stories stories of his own life stories of other peoples lives and a fish story here and there
4680919 a lot of you got to read them but to hear the real thing was even better
4680920 one day the circus came into town and don and i were circus reporters
4680921 it wasnt just the business of the city he would cover he picked up the personalities of the city
4680922 i learned a tremendous amount about behind the scenes government and politics and influence from working with don on that project
4680923 he never took a cheap shot he was never malicious
4680924 im proud to say i live there its a place we visited regularly whenever don sat down to write
4680925 we are very grateful for the four years we were able to give him
4680926 please please find future journalists to do what don did so well
4680927 please dont let him be the last of his breed
4680928 one of a kind thats kind of a hackneyed phrase but its true
4680929 i think when you look at mitt romney hes not in the totally uncomfortable column but hes not in the completely comfortable column so hes kind of in between
4680930 those that do have opposition to him theyre pretty adamant in their opposition
4680931 not advance the ball within the evangelical bloc of voters that mccain needs
4680932 it would make my job to rally the grass roots more difficult
4680933 i think romney would be very acceptable to the foreign policy conservatives and the economic conservatives and most social conservatives
4680934 but i think its fair to say that about 15 to 20 percent of evangelicals would have a difficult time voting for a mormon on either side of the ticket
4680935 it would mean at the margins there would be some evangelicals who just wouldnt vote
4680936 were talking about getting the word out to people about the fact that we dont want mitt romney as the candidate
4680937 there seems to be a groundswell of voices for mitt romney out there but i want to make sure the grass roots voices are heard
4680938 theres a fear that the whole commodity boom is going to end that the bubble is going to burst
4680939 i told him that i know i speak for every american when i say to him today we are all georgians
4680940 saw an enormous billboard that read vladimir putin our president
4680941 as you know through nato membership that if a member nation is attacked it is viewed as an attack on all members we dont have i think right now the ability to intervene in any way except in a humanitarian economic way and do what we can to help the georgians
4680942 might have been viewed as a green light by russia for its attacks on georgia
4680943 weve heard the stories of people trying to rent their houses out and asking too much money and theyre not having any luck
4680944 it comes down to fair market value and competition in order to be competitive i think people need to charge reasonable prices
4680945 a lot of them went overboard on raising their rates but the market is going to deal with those
4680946 those that are asking outrageous prices and minimum stays just arent going to fill up so theyll have to lower them
4680947 some of the restaurants have really raised their prices for renting out their facilities and obviously were going to go with those that are keeping their rates reasonable
4680948 things generally seem to be in line with what our expectations were
4680949 things tend to be expensive in our major cities in california so its not really anything that were surprised to see in terms of room rate prices and costs for buses and costs for food
4680950 theres one hotel we did book that is getting 550 a night and believe me thats not the worst rate out there and thats with a minimum of five nights
4680951 we have people coming in to speak and we absolutely have to have some of those rooms
4680952 well why dont you tell him to give us something we can use to make our case
4680953 we have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and rails

4680968 we have returned and the message is pure and simple the sticking does not stop at the prime minister
4680969 we are the last generation with the opportunity to tackle climate change this is the naked truth
4680970 we can act before its too late but not by burning fossil fuels
4680971 weve also had reports of eight kayaks getting very close to the station although most have now been captured three people reaching the jetty and almost getting over the fence and more rafters dropping a banner reading coal starter gun for climate chaos on a fort opposite the power station
4680972 however as we have seen all week while the majority of people have been law abiding it was clear from early on that a comparatively small number of people were intent on causing trouble
4680973 for example a group of people dressed in dark clothing and wearing what appeared to be masks were seen to cut across the country
4680974 other groups split from the march and also headed to kingsnorth power station across country some again wearing masks we believe individuals from these groups were among those who later made determined efforts to break into the power station
4680975 you know one of the things that we try to do as a campaign is always worry about our campaign and not necessarily comment about what the other folks have done
4680976 and were going to try to continue to do that
4680977 im glad that governor romney is happy with his silver but my experience in politics is there are no bronzes and silvers
4680978 a lookout should be built in green colorbond steel a lookout in the same style as the magnificent grand canyon lookout
4680979 this will not require any tree removal and allow tourists of all ages to safely enjoy the spectacular lookout of the scenic rim
4680980 the lamington plateau remains one of australias seven most superb natural wonders
4680981 there is some urgent need for lateral thinking with the lookout sites
4680982 if it could be done at a reasonable cost out of glass then all the better otherwise green colorbond to match the landscape
4680983 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4680984 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4680985 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4680986 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4680987 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4680988 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4680989 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4680999 ok let me go check the tire pressure and see if any of them are low
4681000 well maam all four tires are a little low but theres not one tire thats significantly lower than the others
4681001 so we can fill the air in your tires or we can bring it into the shop and check the tires balance your tires etc etc i dont remember what else he said but basically check the car for stuff tire related
4681002 um well i guess you can just fill the tires and if the light comes on again then ill bring the car in for you guys to take a look at it
4681003 so it could just be that the tires need air then why did the light come on
4681004 your car is equipped with a tire monitor blah blah blah
4681005 and you really should be checking your tire pressure at least once a month anyway
4681006 sometimes the hardest thing and the right thing are the same
4681007 um i usually do but i havent been watching them this year

4681040 i havent really listened to this album for many many years and yes to my surprise both clarence who was with me during the new mastering and myself loved it i can hardly remember recording it though just fragments bits and pieces
4681041 dont ask me why i remember that the basic idea was to use the gyllene tider band since we just had done the very successful tert get tour and the band sounded extremely tight at the time gt is still a brilliant power pop group if you ask me
4681042 but it only lasted for five six songs if i remember it correctly then christoffer jens and david from brainpool came in and changed my life forever
4681043 well these days i prefer to do my english work as the soothing sunny son of a plumber but hell yes someday ill make the definitive ultra catchy power pop guitars skweeked to 13 sort of record it would be nice i have it in my system somewhere it pops up every other saturday night when i make silly dance moves
4681044 to my and to my familys surprise i always seem to unwind from the crazy tour schedules writing new songs
4681045 i dont know why its always been like that maybe i get bored playing basically the same songs every night i need new blood in my system new stories new truths new lies
4681046 like i said before i only wanted to use the lads as backing musicians i felt songs like stupid do you wanna be my baby reporter elvis in germany and t t t take it would fit this beautiful combo perfectly just the way it worked recording roxettes june afternoon with these guys but i was only partly right like i said after a while we ran out of freash ideas
4681047 well currently im very pleased to be involved in tomas alfredsons movie l t den r tte komma in its a brilliant flick and will kick ass everywhere otherwise theres nothing i can talk about at this point but you know me theres always something waiting around the corner
4681048 but hell yes someday ill make the definitive ultra catchy power pop guitars skweeked to 13 sort of record
4681049 otherwise theres nothing i can talk about at this point but you know me theres always something waiting around the corner
4681050 i just asked myself what i as a fan would want from an album like the world and the most obvious thing to me is behind the scenes material like the original demos for instance
4681051 the volunteer fire department is a vital part of our community and we are pleased to be able to help enhance the tools used by these dedicated volunteers
4681052 this donation will benefit everyone in the community who might need the help of the fire department and we know that the donation will be meaningful to the community for years to come
4681053 oh but donovan i see children in every city around the world
4681054 ok then the boys and i have been talking and we think its time for a raise
4681055 you do your job performance had not improved dramatically since your last performance review what are you basing this on
4681056 well the magic to hold these forms is becoming tolerant again we will need to step up our crystal consumption if you wish us to remain here
4681057 crystals those that we can get at the auction house for less than a thousand a stack those crystals
4681058 sure but we are using more of them so we need a bit more gil
4681059 we pay you far more than you need to buy crystals karl what is this really about
4681060 its been nearly 800 years since we got to know the way of a woman we i need it
4681061 you know the terms of your employment karl if you break disguise or character we will terminate your benefits as well as pay getting together with a woman even a paid one would clearly give you away
4681062 that will not happen make a decision right now will you continue on as our cheerful little karl in jeuno or should i start scouring movalpolis for your replacement
4681063 these people need to believe karl without the children there will be questions ones that will be much more difficult to fix than if you just march your stupid little butt over there and ask people about their magic kits if you cant do that ill release you let the magic catch up with you then you can do whatever the hell you want
4681064 sounds like an incentive to stay employed karl whats it going to be
4681065 if i was gay i would be the best gay of all history
4681066 super happy yellow fun in the sun orange giving tree green bear hug brown awesome dusty pink happy ever after blue famous hot pink and best friends purple some rejected names daddy drinks taupe

4681069 no this guy did not have a black nose he was bigger
4681070 are we talking about jimmy that looks like a bugbear or jimmy that looks like a gobbue

4681072 well i think i have all i need here youll be receiving the results of this review in the mail in two to three weeks
4681073 no once you get your performance review you will will bring it to your local representative and he will reassign you
4681074 female pop rock artist of the year 1996 swedish solo grammy awards

4681076 what do you think you will become with this pop stars good luck
4681077 it comes back every year to varying degrees and the levels of immunity are certainly not as high as we would like them to be
4681078 dengue may be making a resurgence in north america in the future
4681079 anything we learn about west nile virus might help our approach in studying dengue
4681080 if i can vaccinate my horses this can be eliminated and if someone says its not serious just look at a map
4681081 he might be the top position prospect in all of latin america
4681082 weve signed two of the top players available in that market and consider both to be first round draft picks
4681083 overall the big concern that i have in terms of our foreign policy is the articulation of a clear strategy when it comes to an escalation of forces in afghanistan and we are not seeing that
4681084 i am a strong believer that technology can trump environmental problems
4681085 v qu tr nh n y v sau g i l
4681086 being a graduate student is like becoming all of the seven dwarves in the beginning youre dopey and bashful in the middle you are usually sick sneezy tired sleepy and irritable grumpy but at the end they call you doc and then youre happy
4681087 what is written without effort is in general read without pleasure
4681088 at the start you may have to do tasks specifically related to the funding contracts
4681089 graduate school is not primarily about taking courses you will take classes in the beginning but in your later years you probably wont have any classes
4681090 your success in graduate school and beyond depends a great deal upon your ability to build and maintain interpersonal relationships with your adviser your committee your research and support staff and your fellow students
4681091 since academia is a type of business you will have responsibilities that you must uphold you will be asked to greet and talk with visitors give demos show up to meetings get projects done on time etc if you are not well organized you will have a difficult time meeting those obligations there are many different time management and organization skills arrange the tasks in priority and you can find many books on those at your local bookstore
4681092 communication skills both written and oral are vital for making a good impression as a ph d student and as a researcher unfortunately not all graduate students receive training in giving presentations or writing technical documents which are different from english essays these are skills that can be learned its not easy but its well worth the investment if you need practice try giving informal talks at research luncheons joining toastmasters and studying good speakers to see what they do
4681093 confidence is the key to giving a good presentation and the way to gain confidence is to give good presentations here are a few basic points organization counts within the first few paragraphs or first few minutes tell me why i should read your paper or listen to your talk make it clear where we are going and what we have already covered make the text in your slides large enough so that people sitting in the back can read them for large presentation halls this usually means no more than 6 7 lines per slide and 28 point type minimum youd be surprised how many experts on visualization especially tenured professors give presentations with unreadable slides variety retains interest vary your pace tone and volume emphasize the important points look around the room throw in some video pictures or live examples dont stand in front of the screen and block everyones view youd be surprised how often people do this without realizing it point out the limitations of your work that helps your credibility similarly give credit where credit is due make friends with the a v crew running a v is a thankless negative reinforcement job if everything runs smoothly well thats what was supposed to happen so nobody says anything but if anything goes wrong the entire audience looks back at the control room help the a v people help you always check in early and test the equipment tell them what you are going to do in your presentation e g im running 3 video segments make sure you know how everything works long before you come up to the podium and thank the a v crew for their help after you are done writing papers and getting them published is vital for ph d students who want to get jobs in research after graduation your ability to write well significantly improves the chances that your paper will be accepted finally dont forget to communicate with your professors and your teammates keep your committee appraised of your progress one thing i do which few others do is write short 1 screenfull status reports which i religiously e mailed to my professors and team members on a weekly basis these serve as an efficient way of keeping everyone up to date on what im doing they are also a good way for me to record my progress if i need to remember what i got done during a six month period i have plenty of old status reports that i can read youd be amazed how appreciative professors and managers are of this simple practice i also throw in a different humorous quote at the end of each weeks report to reward people for reading it when you are working in the lab and you reach a milestone or achieve a result let people know about it bring in your professors and fellow students and show it off thats a win win situation it lets others know that you are making progress and achieving results and you get valuable feedback and advice
4681094 your adviser must be someone who can cover your area of specialization and someone you can get along with and if circumstances change to make another professor a more appropriate match to your needs dont be afraid to switch if that is an overall win
4681095 it is important to have a network get yourself noticed by other professors and industry people
4681096 dont really like watching the bad bits of the movie
4681097 whatever weakens your reason whatever impairs the tenderness of your conscience whatever obscures your sense of god whatever increases the authority of your body over your mind whatever takes away from your relish for spiritual things that to you is sin no matter how innocent it is in itself
4681098 but put on the lord jesus christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires
4681099 so flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness faith love and peace along with those who call on the lord from a pure heart
4681100 all things are lawful for me but not all things are helpful
4681101 all things are lawful but not all things are helpful all things are lawful but not all things build up
4681102 all things are lawful for me but i will not be enslaved by anything
4681103 so whether you eat or drink or whatever you do do all to the glory of god
4681104 i try to please everyone in everything i do not seeking my own advantage but that of many that they may be saved
4681105 give no offense to jews or to greeks or to the church of god
4681106 therefore if food makes my brother stumble i will never eat meat lest i make my brother stumble
4681107 therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother
4681108 we put no obstacle in anyones way so that no fault may be found within our authority
4681109 the heart is deceitful above all things and desperately sick who can understand it
4681110 to claim that its the original is entirely spurious and is simply selling the novel short
4681111 this is a sanitised hollywood happy ending version where everyone lives happily ever after but frankly this is an outrage and no one should be misled the moment tolstoy thought of these ideas he rejected them and went on to rewrite them
4681112 reading like a writer a guide for people who love books and for those who want to write them
4681113 his central argument is that these books are pointless in a way because as virginia woolf states the
4681114 well you know it is only a dollar and we could use it for a couple different things
4681115 you do have a good point but then we need to buy chocolate
4681116 at the end of this season i felt like i did at the beginning it was the best i felt
4681117 weve got a deadline if it wasnt done its a reality that he would be a college senior this is your last big year with the leverage
4681118 its not like were worried about the minor league options the other issue is we have a lot of free agents and have some room if it would have been a really tight roster it would have been much more difficult
4681119 he played first most of the time at miami but miami had a good third baseman
4681120 we think he can play third base he can definitely play first he may be able to play third
4681121 and you see how were playing right now everybody who watches us you understand why were in the position were in right now and its about continuous effort i cant make it any more plan simple obvious black and white whatever there are no gray areas and i cant have akinora iwamura run like he is and carlos pena and cliff floyd whos got two bad knees etc and then permit that i cant permit it
4681122 if were going to be a really good organization it has to permeate the entire group
4681123 im not just talking about the major league club im talking from rookie ball all the way up to triple a so i hope that our minor leaguers read all about this tomorrow because i want that message sent to them too thats how we play and if were going to compete in this division for years to come we cant take anything for granted and thats what im talking about assumptions you cant assume so for me that has no place here now or in the future and again i cant make it any clearer than that
4681124 i have not spoken to him right now and im not going to tonight
4681125 im going to wait until tomorrow its one of those things where you get really upset sometimes you say things you dont really mean so ill wait until tomorrow but he wont be in the lineup i can tell you that
4681126 i didnt run it out again im not playing tomorrow either theres not much more i can say
4681127 he made the move when he wanted to make the move
4681128 i mean im going to have to if he keeps doing it making me the example
4681129 so i guess i cant let him make me the example any more i guess im the only one not running them out you cant be singled out when youre the only one not doing it
4681130 hopefully its over with and this is the last time we deal with it
4681131 a case of the nerves both at the plate and on the mound
4681132 these guys are more nervous now than they were on the baseball field i promise
4681133 if im showing a picasso i want them to see a picasso
4681134 its not as easy as it seems to just go in and say poof
4681135 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4681136 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4681137 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4681138 du scheinst sehr lieb und nett zu sein ich sehe das sofort
4681139 oh ich auch hab fr her in sythen gewohnt aber jetzt wohne ich in castrop
4681140 du bist nicht nur h bsch und nett du hast auch noch einen geilen arsch du t nst mich voll an
4681141 typical this is what i get for being a responsible buyer
4681142 we had to make that choice it was fair both for lin miaoke and yang peiyi
4681143 the audience will understand that its in the national interest
4681144 nine year old lin miaoke becomes instant star with patriotic song
4681145 this is like a voiceover for a cartoon character why couldnt they pick a kid who is both cute and a good singer this damages the reputation of both kids for their future especially the one lip synching now everyone knows shes a fraud who cares if shes cute
4681146 they want the best looking people to represent the face of china i dont blame the organizers for picking a prettier looking kid over the not so pretty one
4681147 its the unfortunate reality that these sort of things turn political
4681148 still cannot believe his daughter has become an international singing sensation

4681154 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4681155 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4681156 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4681157 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4681158 tapi kita harus ingat walau sekadar jabat tangan dan menyentuh pipi dengan pipi ini juga ada manfaatnya ada rasa kehangatan ketika kita saling berjabat tangan namun bila ini dilakukan lebih dari ini yaitu dengan pelukan erat tentu lebih bermanfaat unsur terapinya lebih tinggi

4681171 behold i establish my covenant with you and your offspring after you 10 and with every living creature that is with you the birds the livestock and every beast of the earth with you as many as came out of the ark it is for every beast of the earth 11 i establish my covenant with you that never again shall all flesh be cut off by the waters of the flood and never again shall there be a flood to destroy the earth
4681172 this is the sign of the covenant that i make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for bow in the cloud and it shall be a sign of the covenant between me and the earth bring clouds over the earth and the bow is seen in the clouds what i saw today and youve probably seen it before too 15 i will remember my covenant that is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall never again become a flood to destroy all flesh 16 when the bow is in the clouds i will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between god and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth

4681180 what system do i hope to improve by doing this workout and what am i really trying to accomplish
4681181 this progression from hardware to systems software to applications software to network to service and now to data has such a compelling momentum that leads inexorably to the question whats next
4681182 its too early for specifics but one thing that has worked is an alliance in which people contribute to a free software project we saw this succeed with apache the open source webserver apache was a tiny group of volunteers yet the vast majority of its code has come from companies who paid people to work on it its essentially an industrial consortium that has been able to fend off microsofts closed source webserver so it makes sense for second tier search companies who are falling behind google to contribute to a free search software project that will make us equal to google in terms of search quality
4681183 want to be an a list blogger 1 go to techmeme 2 look for the top three stories 3 write about them every day 4 go to the blogs of the other people who are writing about these stories and comment 5 do this every day and attend every conference going 6 and youll be an a lister write once every two weeks and wonder why you arent an a lister
4681184 yes transparency counts but if youre going to make a media business out of it you never ever want anyone to be able to say that you benefited from the people you wrote about all you have as a blogger is your authenticity your trust
4681185 this is rediculous how could this company willingly attempt to gain customers by playing on emotions or taking advantage of our hope or hardtimes
4681186 accost strangers and ask them would you mind taking my picture
4681187 and thus an act of civility was converted into a branding event

4681206 republicans are too scared to go home to face their constituents after voting against bills to force big oil companies to use it or lose it demand that the president free our oil from the government stockpile and crack down on speculators

4681208 its going to bring down the price at the pump

4681226 members of the catholic faithful should not support or participate in saturdays event
4681227 carries with it very serious penal sanctions in church law
4681228 has no connection to roman catholic liturgy or sacraments and cannot in any way be recognized as a valid reception of sacred orders
4681229 the problem is not that all of a sudden there was a tsunami of attempted ordinations of women
4681230 for the good of the church and to ensure bishops have a common way of responding
4681231 they ask why would you excommunicate someone who just wants to serve god
4681232 more and more catholics are accepting the idea of women priests she said
4681233 we are building a renewed model of priesthood for a renewed roman catholic church in a community of equals in which all are welcome at the sacred eucharistic table
4681234 there is no punishment there is nothing the institutional church can do to stop this movement

4681320 warning that california faces catastrophic water shortages from a worsening drought sen dianne feinstein on tuesday upbraided state lawmakers for failing to rally behind a proposed 9 3 billion water bond for the november ballot
4681321 feinstein has joined republican gov arnold schwarzenegger in calling for major improvements to state water storage and delivery systems but their water bond plan has run aground in the legislature
4681322 lawmakers particularly democrats have been loath to support the program which would include 3 billion for water storage and 1 9 billion to repair levees and restore the ecosystem of the sacramento san joaquin delta
4681323 legislative efforts to place the measure on the november ballot have also stumbled amid the states bitter budget standoff
4681324 in a speech to the sacramento metropolitan chamber of commerce feinstein urged lawmakers to end the budget stalemate and put the water infrastructure proposal on the ballot
4681325 she warned that that the states water supply is drying up with a decreasing sierra snowpack that could shrink by 40 percent by 2050 due to global warming
4681326 the last major addition to californias water systems was in the 1960s
4681327 our state had 16 million people then we have 38 million now and we have the same water infrastructure
4681328 one thing we have learned in more than 40 years of anti poverty programs in the united states is that when large numbers of poor people are concentrated into single neighborhoods it becomes much more difficult for them to get out of poverty
4681329 the sad truth is that the scale of our housing assistance to low income people in this country is tiny compared with the need we need more housing assistance and we also need investment in education and job training expansion of the earned income tax credit and more of the support low income parents need to enter the job market including child care and health insurance

4681336 on one side of the gravel road are hundreds of acres of corn on the other is a much different crop that scientists hope will enable farmers to rebuild sinking islands in the sacramento san joaquin river delta combat global warming and make a profit at the same time
4681337 the alternate field is full of tules and cattails that are being grown by the u s geological survey on about 15 acres on twitchell island about 5 7 square miles of rich but fragile peat soil 30 miles south of sacramento
4681338 the plants can grow high enough to dwarf the average adult as they die and decay they slowly build up the peat the soil under the 15 acre site has risen 1 to 2 feet since the project was moved there in 1996
4681339 washington the number of chronically homeless people living in the nations streets and shelters has dropped by about 30 percent to 123 833 from 175 914 between 2005 and 2007 bush administration officials said tuesday
4681340 housing officials say the statistics which the department of housing and urban development collects each year from more than 3 800 cities and counties may reflect better data collection and reporting and some variation in the number of communities reporting on an annual basis
4681341 in that approach local officials place chronically homeless people into permanent shelter apartments halfway houses or rooms and then focus on treating addiction and mental and health problems hud defines chronically homeless people as disabled individuals who have been continuously homeless for more than a year or have experienced at least four episodes of homelessness in the past three years

4681346 washington the bush administration monday proposed a regulatory overhaul of the endangered species act to allow federal agencies to decide whether protected species would be imperiled by agency projects eliminating the independent scientific reviews that have been required for more than three decades
4681347 the new rules which will be subject to a 30 day comment period would use administrative powers to make broad changes in the law that congress has resisted for years
4681348 bob irvin senior vice president of conservation programs at the advocacy group defenders of wildlife questioned how some federal agencies could make the assessments when most do not have wildlife biologists on staff
4681349 clearly thats a case of asking the fox to guard the chicken coop
4681350 a giant caution light that made federal agencies stop and think about the impacts of their actions what the bush administration is telling those agencies is they dont have to think about those impacts anymore
4681351 but dale hall who directs the fish and wildlife service said the move would not apply to major federal projects and would give his agency more time to focus on the most critically endangered species rather than conducting reviews of projects that pose little threat
4681352 we have to have the ability to put our efforts where theyre needed
4681353 this really says to the agencies this law belongs to all of us
4681354 in what appears to be a california first state highway officials are shelving a major highway 50 widening plan in sacramento until they can study whether the expansion will contribute to global warming
4681355 the state department of transportation announced tuesday it will not fight a sacramento court ruling that the agency conducted an incomplete environmental review for a project that would add lanes on the congested rancho cordova freeway
4681356 for commuters in the fast growing highway 50 corridor it means no new freeway elbow room if any at all until at least 2014
4681357 the added lanes planned between sunrise boulevard and watt avenue would be designated for carpools buses and high mileage vehicles during morning and afternoon commutes
4681358 the freeway already has carpool lanes between sunrise boulevard and el dorado hills and caltrans officials have talked of extending carpool lanes into downtown sacramento

4681373 it might be hard to tell from a visit to a local soup kitchen or while walking downtown sacramentos k street mall but local and national efforts to find shelter for people who are homeless for extended periods are working officials say
4681374 sacramento officials report that from january 2007 to january 2008 the number of chronically homeless was down 5 percent even as the total number of homeless within sacramento county increased
4681375 the sacramento program got off to a quick start by identifying homes that groups of recently homeless people could share
4681376 five larger facilities with onsite supportive services are in the process of being approved and built those facilities will add 260 permanent beds for people looking to get off the streets the program hopes to build or find 1 600 housing units over 10 years
4681377 the electric power research institute estimates enough wave power can be extracted from coastal waters to account for about 15 percent of californias electricity production wind could provide up to 110 percent according to a stanford university study published last year
4681378 wind power off californias coast is now just a thought among power developers and there are no concrete plans to erect turbines at sea
4681379 offshore wind and wave technologies are promising but theyre untried they also raise concerns about potential damage to the coasts prized vistas and fish industry
4681380 one proposal to draw electricity from waves off the mendocino coast already has generated problems for developers government agencies and coastal residents
4681381 moreover the potential for wind and waves depends on someone building transmission lines to connect offshore power to the states grid
4681382 in a boon for the ports summer business escondido based enxco inc is delivering 11 shiploads of massive components destined for the companys new shiloh ii wind farm near rio vista
4681383 about half of the parts made in germany and south korea are sitting on the ground at the ports west sacramento facility the rest are due in coming weeks
4681384 once all have arrived theyll be transported to the shiloh site where 75 turbines are expected to be in operation by years end eventually producing 150 megawatts of electricity for pg amp e says enxco spokeswoman sandra briner
4681385 these are big turbines 271 feet high each has four sections and three blades that are 148 feet long a complete unit weighs about 277 tons
4681386 multiply that by 75 and you have better than 20 700 tons of energy producing parts coming through the port its a huge piece of business worth about 275 000 luken says and likely to grow given federal tax credits offered to wind farmers

4681632 napoli prendi pasqual punterei sulla voglia di riscatto di de zerbi denis e maggio grandissimi acquisti
4681633 lavorare in una piazza esigente come napoli non stato mai semplice molti allenatori hanno fallito e sono andati via dopo pochissime partite mister reja credo sia lallenatore giusto per proseguire nel progetto di crescita attuato dalla societ un uomo di esperienza che forse in passato ha raccolto molto meno rispetto alla sua competenza e professionalit credo che allenare il napoli sia il giusto tributo per la sua lunghissima carriera
4681634 i due nuovi arrivati maggio e denis nella partita di giovedi sono stati fondamentali al fine della vittoria il primo perch riesce a garantire la giusta copertura in fase difensiva e la giusta spinta e vivacit in fase propositiva direi che in italia abbiamo pochissimi giocatori con le sue caratteristiche forse esiste solo zambrotta con tali qualit
4681635 di vitale avevo pi un ricordo da trequartista ai tempi del lanciano e riscoprirlo come terzino stata una piacevole sorpresa non ha per niente sfigurato in queste prime apparizioni del napoli ma sono del parere che per affrontare varie competizioni si debba disporre di pi alternative per ogni singolo ruolo il solo vitale a sinistra mi sembra un p un azzardo un giocatore che consiglierei al napoli senza dubbio pasqual della fiorentina che ha tutte le prerogative per adattarsi al tipo di gioco che attua mister reja terzino di qualit se dovesse arrivare credo sia lennesimo grande colpo della gestione marino
4681636 fu unannata catastrofica disastrosa nonostante unintelaiatura costruita per puntare alla qualificazione alla coppa uefa i risultati tardavano ad arrivare e pian piano la squadra scivol allultimpo posto in classifica inghiottita da una crisi senza precedenti cambiammo ben quattro allenatori mutti mazzone galeone e montefusco e tre direttori tecnici ottavio bianchi bagni e juliano ma la situazione era gi compromessa quel gruppo totalizz soltanto 14 punti in tutto il campionato record negativo della storia del calcio napoli fu anche per me una stagione sfortunata mi infortunai nel periodo in cui la squadra necessitava di pi esperienza e dovetti stare lontano dal terreno di gioco per circa 5 mesi quando tornai eravamo gi retrocessi
4681637 le basi calcistiche ci devono per forza essere per poter essere un allenatore completo per quanto mi riguarda non appena ho deciso di intraprendere questa carriera ho subito iniziato a frequentare i corsi tenuti a coverciano per poter percepire il patentino tecnico necessario ad allenare una squadra professionistica e in aggiunta ho partecipato anche a master tenuti in giro per litalia un allenatore con trascorsi importanti in grado gi di gestire situazioni delicate dal rapporto con la stampa alla gestione dei giocatori poich gi conosce il meccanismo dellambiente e parte quindi in netto vantaggio rispetto ad un collega che ha dal suo canto molta teoria ma poca pratica
4681638 per poter vincere qualcosa in questo mondo bisogna prima circondarsi delle persone giuste quindi punterei soprattutto sulla dirigenza per dare una certa continuit ai progetti societari poi in seguito punterei su giovani talenti affiancandoli con giocatori desperienza per poter cosi valorizzare anche il settore giovanile direi che la politica attuata da napoli e fiorentina in questi anni rispecchia in modo fedele pieno il mio pensiero a riguardo

4681679 it seems like all testing that has occurred up to this point from previous sites has shown it has worked well to segregate those spoils from getting back into contact with the environment also in our mind it is a good program for the economy since it accomplishes navigational dredging that opens up more sites in the harbor for commerce
4681680 as we move closer to the opening of our new state of the art medical center we must bid farewell to the old front parking lot and main entrance

4681705 the only think i can think of paul is strings
4681706 fake fireworks a fake singer and now fake children at the olympics opening ceremony
4681707 it is typical for chinese performers to wear different apparel from different ethnic groups
4681708 they will wear different apparel to signify people are friendly and happy together
4681709 some footage had been produced before the opening ceremony to provide theatrical effect
4681710 were genuinely produced some maybe were used from previously recorded material
4681711 i have a lot of respect for al gores ideas
4681712 afp is an organization of grassroots leaders who engage citizens in the name of limited government and free markets on the local state and federal levels the grassroots members of afp advocate for public policies that champion the principles of entrepreneurship and fiscal and regulatory restraint afp foundation is committed to educating citizens about economic policy and a return of the federal government to its constitutional limits afp foundations educational programs and analyses help policymakers the media and individual citizens understand why policies that promote the american enterprise system are the best method to ensuring prosperity for all americans to that end afp and afp foundation supports cutting taxes and government spending in order to halt the encroachment of government in the economic lives of citizens by fighting proposed tax increases and pointing out evidence of waste fraud and abuse tax and expenditure limitations to promote fiscal responsibility removing unnecessary barriers to entrepreneurship and opportunity by sparking citizen involvement in the regulatory process early on in order to reduce red tape restoring fairness to our judicial system
4681713 we all exhale co2 therefore how can that be pollution
4681714 gores mission of educating people and working with governments around the world merits the jets
4681715 i am not only talking about the opening ceremony which was grand also but the entire competition with all its drama and tragedy
4681716 the corridors 8 9 and 10 are now under construction and will finish within 107 days
4681717 over the past few years i lived in a democratic society i was happy and now america and the european union are spitting on us
4681718 this country will be destroyed if we do not stop the growth of corruption there needs to be some shock therapy so the people know that this government is serious about corruption
4681719 corruption is worse than prostitution the latter might endanger the morals of an individual the former invariably endangers the morals of the entire country
4681720 were trying to put more resources into that community which very much deserves them
4681721 with only four courtrooms the new bedford courthouse is extremely undersized
4681722 the only way we can provide the new bedford community with the additional resources it needs so it can have its cases heard in an appropriately timely way was to take the civil trials and put them in a neighboring court
4681723 they claim they need more court space but i think hopefully that can be resolved without the move taking place
4681724 we ought to be moving things into the city not out
4681725 any situation where there is a particular circumstance that prevents someone from getting to the wareham district court they need only bring that to the attention of the first justice
4681726 im not fundamentally against the decision but i want rationale for the decision
4681727 the city is fully prepared to assist in locating additional space for the district court in order to address its problem regarding the courts docket
4681728 we are looking forward to meeting with them the elected officials next week to review with them the plan
4681729 the number of artists that he was involved with and helped significantly or just made great records with the list is almost unbelievable
4681730 watson is well advised and will i am sure be well advised to stay clear of eubank
4681731 the very worst outcome would be for change of use to be granted and our major concerns over parking to be ignored this would hurt enormously and be a slap in the face to local residents and democracy
4681732 the site is surrounded by 49 old dwellings that have no facility for off street parking
4681733 this has led to an aggravated parking problem in the area which due to geography and street layout causes bad feeling loss of amenity and is constantly referred to the town council as a big problem
4681734 this cannot and must not be allowed to get any worse this development should it be approved must be able to contain all the vehicles it is expected to generate
4681735 this equates to at least two cars per household these days and this must be considered a minimum provision there cannot be any excuse for approving a development in this position which would for years to come create misery and disharmony for both existing and potential new residents alike that would be very unprofessional indeed
4681736 re help ds has reflux nothing is helping i dont know if youd be interested in this or not but ill include the
4681737 when you see yourself doing something badly and nobodys bothering you to tell you anymore thats a very bad place to be your critics are the ones telling you they still love you and care
4681738 a mans health can be judged by which he takes two at a time pills or stairs

4681742 sky viewers are now in for a real treat as they watch an exciting and dramatic phase of amir khans career unfold in front of them as he goes from unbeaten prospect and commonwealth lightweight champion to a world champion
4681743 along with big world title fights im thrilled that some of the best young and talented boxers in britain that i promote also feature prominently and will develop into stars of the future all on sky
4681744 remember me with smiles and laughter for thats how i will remember you all if you can only remember me with tears then dont remember me at all
4681745 als letzten habe ich auch noch einen sicheren die zweieinhalb delfin dazwischen ist es bunt gemischt

4681747 es ist alles ganz gleich wie letztes jahr es ist alles wieder frisch im kopf ich freue mich schon auf montag und bin auch schon ein bisschen nerv s

4681750 ich brauche einfach nur vanessa zu sein am wettkampftag und muss daran glauben dass alles m glich ist
4681751 we are very happy that the standard times continues to be recognized as one of the countrys truly great regional newspapers
4681752 we serve an interesting and important community and we are glad that the newspaper helps give a voice to the people who live on southcoast our staff works very hard to give readers and advertisers the very best product and service
4681753 the standard times provides its readers powerful content thats complete and compelling what puts this newspaper head and shoulders above other similarly sized newspapers is its investment in special coverage the standard times does its job and then a great deal more for its readers
4681754 goes far beyond its print edition to serve its readers taking full advantage of the web and mobile more newspapers need to follow their lead
4681755 clean and consistent design packaging and typography which makes the newspaper reader friendly
4681756 good to great news and feature photography artwork and graphics
4681757 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4681758 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4681759 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4681760 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4681761 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4681762 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4681763 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4681764 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers
4681765 obama is not a marxist or a radical yet it is clear that radicals have influenced his judgment
4681766 the obama nation leftist politics and the cult of personality
4681767 the case against barack obama the unlikely rise and unexamined agenda of the medias favorite candidate
4681768 obama wants to will all the white blood out of himself so he can become pure black
4681769 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4681770 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4681771 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4681772 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4681773 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4681774 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4681775 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4681776 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4681777 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4681778 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4681779 one year after the onset of the first symptoms of a financial crisis all indicators confirm that the fever has spread to all the national economies europes national economies have slowed down dramatically above all key economies like germany france italy and of course spain which have all registered zero or slightly above zero growth in comparison to previous growth figures europe must adopt a coordinated strategy to tackle common problems such as financial instability the european central bank has an important role to play here so far it has been preoccupied with fighting inflation rather than boosting the economy and its capacity to create jobs
4681780 worn out by the constant flow of bad economic news over the past year consumers are obviously pessimistic but there is no cause for panic because there are arguments to support a more positive perspective within four weeks the oil price has gone down by almost 25 percent and many other raw materials are considerably cheaper than they were the threat of further inflation is therefore receding and the euro has also sunk below the 1 50 dollar mark which will have a positive impact on exports and even the 0 5 percent decrease in germanys economy was considerably less than expected in short it does not look like we are facing a recession which is generally announced when growth decelerates in two consecutive quarters therefore we would be well advised not to talk of a recession for the time being
4681781 technically we are not yet there but psychologically europe has already entered a recession eurostat signals a gdp drop of 0 2 percent in the eurozone the worst result since the introduction of the single currency the european commission is attempting to dampen the alarm signals and span safety nets but what really troubles brussels is the confidence of businesses and consumers which has sunk to an all time low and dispels all hope of a reverse trend paradoxically the proof comes from a positive index despite the rise in raw material prices inflation has remained constant at four percent that means citizens have responded to the price rises by curtailing consumption and in so doing brought about the negative trend
4681782 whether gdp goes up or down by one percent is completely irrelevant for office workers if the figure is high the companies did well but for the average citizen what counts is how much goes into their pockets moreover it is long term development that matters instead of debating schemes to give the economy a quick boost politicians should be concentrating their energy on how the state can create good conditions for growth growth that benefits the majority of the population in the long term it is more effective to invest in education highly qualified workers have less to fear from cheap competition from abroad this strategy may not improve the gdp figures for the next quarter but it would certainly improve the long term prospects of employees
4681783 preten i n is the place where mystery sits at a table with elegance and imagination orders a round of drinks before dinner it is a world where those drinks are served by a pompous clown
4681784 join pinchbottom on a sensual quest for preten i n an imaginary yet sexy element that turns burlesque performers from jerkques ordinary people into self important cirques infuriatingly magical unendurably spellbinding artistes who peel away the mundane with every layer of clothing
4681785 were couldnt be more thrilled that spiegelworld invited us to be a part of their september and october lineup
4681786 and we hope that this show will honor both their history and the history of these wonderful spiegeltents while at the same time mocking it mercilessly
4681787 last night lisaraye her cousin phillip travis and her publicist lynn jetter assaulted the guard at the premiers home proceeded to ransack the house and then assaulted the premier and his sister as the result of her assault on them both the premier and his sister were taken to the hospital with injuries and later released the premier at no time had any physical contact with lisaraye it is public knowledge that the couple has been separated for months and lisaraye has no lawful right to be in the residence her conduct yesterday clearly contradicts her stated commitment to dissolve the marriage amicably
4681788 naturally no one has ever claimed that the eu should single handedly intervene to end acts of war but our lacking ability to turn pretty words into deeds has encouraged regional powers to take matters into their own hands in regions where they are pursuing their own interests this applies to russia in the caucasus turkey in kurdistan israel in the palestinian territories and sudan in darfur the eu has great responsibilities in the conflicts in kurdistan the palestinian territories and darfur but as long as we are unable to keep even russia which is on our own doorstep in check it is difficult to be optimistic if the 21st century is to be anything other than a century of illusions the eu states must develop a new active foreign policy which can offer resistance to russia and other aggressors
4681789 it was the first year round drive in in minnesota
4681790 and this guy says you got it in 20 seconds
4681791 he was very very proud of his food and what he served the public

4681798 any basset hound is capable of earning a field championship
4681799 they catch on very quickly once the light is turned on
4681800 they have to find the rabbit and put their nose to the ground
4681801 she has a beautiful voice but there are no tracks

4681808 never mind just get in position for the next event would you this ones really important
4681809 im very fascinated with that convergence between the heightened elements of genre entertainment and literary sophistication
4681810 it illuminates both the mythical nature of these genre conventions but also the magical nature of the mundane and everyday
4681811 hes one of our biggest thinking playwrights in america today
4681812 he doesnt write a play that doesnt have some gigantic idea embedded in it
4681813 hes not afraid to write a big play even in this day and age where it seems harder to get a big play produced
4681814 has this really big vision and limitless imagination there is nothing he shies away from
4681815 she unzips his skin and inside him is the sky
4681816 jason seems to create really human relatable characters in these fantastic landscapes
4681817 jason uses magical realism to take on social and cultural issues
4681818 a play that i dont want to write which is this identity politics play
4681819 i must warn you not to use the spindles for support
4681820 and mind your left shoulder on the overhang at the top
4681821 i will put chaos into fourteen lines and keep him there and let him thence escape if he be lucky
4681822 the couches looked badly worn the whole place seemed shabby and dim
4681823 there was a look of fright in her bright green eyes
4681824 the burden of revenge i carried the darkness i was capable of
4681825 what not to do life follows its path we follow lifes path
4681826 it has made the grade it has passed its acceptable
4681827 russia was provoked and therefore declared war on georgia it used this opportunity to show the world that the times of its humiliation have come to an end and that it will no longer tolerate nato interference in its zone of influence one thing seems logical to me those who support kosovos independence have no right to deny it to other regions like south ossetia but what is at stake here is not just rights but also power russia has won back its power and will impose it on countries like ukraine georgia and one day perhaps also the baltic states and separate these countries from europe and america if necessary with brute force vladimir putin once said the end of the ussr was the worst thing that happened in the 20th century i said at the time that he had only got the century wrong it is only now that we will experience the true consequences of the soviet implosion after the american mistakes of the past few years the next us president will face the following decision either he withdraws and leaves many eastern countries exposed to russias influence or he stays and we see a war between the us and russia kosovo and georgia are the first episodes of a film that could have an unhappy ending

4681829 they criticize themselves constantly interrupt themselves continually in their own course come back to the apparently accomplished in order to begin it afresh deride with unmerciful thoroughness the inadequacies weaknesses and paltrinesses of their first attempts seem to throw down their adversary only in order that he may draw new strength from the earth and rise again more gigantic before them recoil even and anon from the indefinite prodigiousness of their own aims
4681830 the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations
4681831 it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley fuedal ties that bound man to his natural superiors
4681832 and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self interest than callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervour of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation
4681833 it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom free trade
4681834 in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploration
4681835 constant revolutionizing of production everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones
4681836 the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe
4681837 industries no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe
4681838 in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes
4681839 in place of the old local and national seclusion and self sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal interdependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one sidedness and narrow mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
4681840 men make their own history but they do not make it as they please they do not make it under self selected circumstances but under circumstances existing already given and transmitted from the past
4681841 hegel remarks somewhere that all great world historic facts and personages appear so to speak twice he forgot to add the first time as tragedy the second time as farce

4681845 i think the russian behavior over the last several days is generally concerning not only to the united states but to all of our european allies
4681846 im gonna try to see if i can get some bigwigs from back here to go up there and say look uh you just gotta make up your mind you gotta get this done

4681848 i hope we can work something out to make sure you arent led astray on this occasion
4681849 that would undermine the purpose of the payments which was to avoid public disclosure of the affair
4681850 the idea that edwards finance chairman can independently hand over substantial sums of money to two campaign workers at a time when edwards is a candidate and to argue that that is not related to his campaign is a bit preposterous
4681851 one thing thats possible is that she was still owed money from what shed done before for the political action committee but obviously there are less charitable explanations
4681852 made a very serious mistake a mistake that i am responsible for and no one else
4681853 and then she forgave me and we went to work on it
4681854 i talked to john tuesday and hes not doing well
4681855 hes just to be very frank with you hes just not doing well he needs to be concentrating on himself and his family at this point in his life hes a good boy he just made a hell of a mistake
4681856 the bottom line to it is john edwards and elizabeth edwards had no knowledge of anything i did
4681857 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words

4681878 in a broad sense i will work for a sustainable and growing economy this economy must be clean
4681879 all new public buildings should be green buildings and fossil fuels are dead energy sources
4681880 it needs to be about your neighbor and my neighbor and somebody who needs help and unfortunately we all know someone like that right now
4681881 it is about time to get new blood new energy in the u s senate and stand up for democratic principles
4681882 the current councilor is in my opinion not doing the job
4681883 to me that is unacceptable because when your councilor isnt there you dont have say in whos judging you
4681884 no really its too terrible if you knew what i knew youd never be happy
4681885 you cant see it but i can see that not too far from here all of the waves are crashing on the shore we are going to disappear

4681898 im sure dear lord that you saved his soul at the end you gave him the faith
4681899 you have to wonder when they look at what they consider a loophole with such excitement
4681900 that would suggest manipulating the process and i think opens the door to suspicion
4681901 the prospect of someone coming in with no id and registering and voting is contrary to every sort of protection that legislators and lawmakers have built into this system for decades
4681902 the processes and the law and the systems in our 88 counties are not equipped to handle same day registration
4681903 this is one of many ways well be encouraging our supporters to skip the lines on election day and make sure their vote is cast early

4681908 is perfectly natural for putin medvedev is used to playing the good cop
4681909 shook the hands of soldiers met the refugees and told the world what russia would do he was the man of action in the eyes of russian voters
4681910 medvedev declared a humanitarian catastrophe was not a good thing
4681911 the crisis made it clear who was in charge if anyone had any illusions earlier
4681912 putin acted as the one taking the crucial decisions he explained to the nation the legal basis of russias intervention in georgia it was putin who first used the word genocide which was later echoed by medvedev
4681913 it is particularly important that putin was the first to make a public statement he became the first newsmaker
4681914 there are two races of beings the masses teeming and happy common clay if you like eating breeding working counting their pennies people who just live ordinary people xxx and then there are the others the noble ones the heroes the ones you can quite well imagine lying shot pale and tragic one minute triumphant with a guard of honor and the next being marched away between two gendarmes

4681916 that chinglish will persist and even thrive far after the games have ended
4681917 an unambiguous and consistent national population policy is long overdue in our country caught between a hard church and a soft state are the overwhelming majority of filipinos who affirm the importance of helping women and couples control the size of their families
4681918 chairman rogge has already watched eight events and he is very pleased with the cooperative efforts between us and the beijing organizing committee
4681919 the beijing organizing committee has provided high standard high quality conditions and has done excellent work we have received very positive feedback from the federation
4681920 their work has gone very smoothly and i havent heard any complaints about transportation at all
4681921 beautiful synergy between the comelec philippine national police the armed forces of the philippines the pprcv and citizens groups all of which were allowed to do what they were supposed to do
4681922 while people are paying 3 75 a gallon for gas
4681923 increase the supply and lower the cost of petroleum by temporarily suspending the acquisition of petroleum for the strategic petroleum reserve
4681924 experiments in high tech edutainment engaging students in a media rich popular culture course
4681925 generic intellectual abilities and a broad understanding of the world
4681926 we are delighted to come to terms with eric hosmer we felt that he was the best high school position player in the draft
4681927 i also have to recognize the support of david and dan glass and the great work of our scouting staff for helping to get eric into our organization
4681928 its believed that he took the deal against boras advice
4681929 how to discover your hidden abilites to create the success you desire on exams
4681930 if you dont like something change it if you cant change it change your attitude dont complain
4681931 the greatest discovery of my generation is that man can alter his life simply by altering his attitude of mind
4681932 ability is what youre capable of doing motivation determines what you do attitude determines how well you do it
4681933 the best way to inspire people to superior performance is to convince them by everything you do and by your everyday attitude that you are wholeheartedly supporting them
4681934 the greatest discovery of my generation is that human beings can alter their lives by altering their attitudes of mind
4681935 a daily glance in the mirror can tell you what you look like but a daily adjustment of your attittude can tell you what you will live like
4681936 they invited me up as a courtesy because i am new to talk about the background of the project and how they intend to handle traffic issues
4681937 it would be nice if they would give us copies
4681938 we have to deal with the property as far as it conforms to the zoning
4681939 until then we are just second guessing im not sure why they apparently showed plans without giving copies to him mr davis in the interest of improving their relationship with the town i wish kgi would sit down with selectmen and members of the community to discuss the project
4681940 everybody is making a big deal about it but nothing really happened
4681941 the great task in front of us over the next two years is to lift the experience of the linux desktop from something that is stable and robust and not so pretty into something that is art
4681942 can we not only emulate but can we blow right past apple
4681943 there are a few small mining companies that are on the pathway minemakers is a company whose name is being thrown around lately
4681944 there was a light that goes on and off and that was one red light
4681945 i almost lost her shes my my baby my pumpkin pie
4681946 my rule i dont care if their 16 years old dont play in the car just stay out of the car
4681947 for all the pictures and notes that the child collects what we did was cut a piece of plexiglas and we just simply put it on top of their desk
4681948 that way they can take their pictures and their notes and slip them underneath the great thing about plexiglas is that its safer than glass and its inexpensive
4681949 this lidded basket from ten thousand villages is perfect for kids because its large enough to hold a significant amount of clothes
4681950 but it also has a lid so you get to cover up and dont see a mess on the floor every day
4681951 we put some of the childs favorite items that she uses on a daily basis instead of sticking them in a drawer or hiding them in bins and baskets this way she can see her objects grab them and go
4681952 a lookout should be built in green colorbond steel a lookout in the same style as the magnificent grand canyon lookout
4681953 this will not require any tree removal and allow tourists of all ages to safely enjoy the spectacular lookout of the scenic rim
4681954 the lamington plateau remains one of australias seven most superb natural wonders
4681955 there is some urgent need for lateral thinking with the lookout sites
4681956 if it could be done at a reasonable cost out of glass then all the better otherwise green colorbond to match the landscape
4681957 its not as easy as it seems to just go in and say poof
4681958 i wanna talk about me wanna talk about i wanna talk about number one on my me mind what i think what i like what i know what i want what i see
4681959 i wanna talk about me wanna talk about i wanna talk about number one on my me mind what i think what i like what i know what i want what i see
4681960 there are many negative stories about prem and it isnt fair to him
4681961 i wanna talk about me wanna talk about i wanna talk about number one on my me mind what i think what i like what i know what i want what i see
4681962 i think mr deeb has crossed a line somewhere this is not what we would consider to be a customary home occupation
4681963 allow me to translate ms wildermans words into plain english mr deeb hasnt actually violated any law or regulation that i can find but i dont like what hes doing because im ignorant and irrationally afraid of chemicals so ill abuse my power to steal his property and shut him down
4681964 in effect the massachusetts authorities have invaded deebs lab apparently without a warrant and stolen his property deeb presumably under at least the implied threat of further action has not objected to the warrantless search and the confiscation of his property or perhaps hes just biding his time it appears that deeb has grounds for a nice juicy lawsuit here
4681965 i have been living and working here for more than four decades in addition dozens of my students puppeteers and artists work here every day if the condominium is built it will damage my work with the dust disrupt work at the foundation and pollute our community
4681966 funcionarios del cuerpo nacional de polic a escupieron a g m le golpearon por todo el cuerpo mientras permanec a esposada produci ndole contusiones en hombro antebrazo y muslo
4681967 las fuerzas del orden p blico cumplan su deber que es proteger a los ciudadanos y ciudadanas particularmente a las m s vulnerables y no agredirles
4681968 itd probably be good to have a couple around for spares
4681969 the bottom line is that youre getting rid of the stuff
4681970 most cities are strange in the sense that periodically we have very unique things to get rid of
4681971 luckily the internet is making it easier for us to find these things a home
4681972 we didnt know what to do they weighed about five tons they were just huge
4681973 there were rumors for a while that michael jackson had expressed interest in them in bringing them down to neverland
4681974 traditionally cities are very good at buying things and not very good at getting rid of them
4681975 in this case we were able to reach a really big audience we had bids on the slide from canada and california
4681976 he was supposed to report back to one of our officers after he was released from jail
4681977 we had planned to arrest him when he showed back up
4681978 the officer had to chase him down and corner him at a chain link fence
4681979 i dont know about next year a lot can happen in the offseason
4681980 it probably will have a lot to do with what they decide to do with the general manager position
4681981 all i know is rumors and you never know how accurate those are
4681982 i have to go out and give my team a chance to win no matter who im pitching for im disappointed but if i fall on my face the last six weeks of the season i wont be in anyones plans next year the mariners or someone trying to trade for me
4681983 thats when he shoots her three times and she fell to her knees and she was like travis what was that and hes like it was a cap gun the one that makes noise and she felt her neck and it was all bloody
4681984 she said theres a guy out here and hes got a rope and hes trying to do things to me and he shot me
4681985 rape her and kill her and put her in a cardboard box in the ocean
4681986 weve got a nice place thisll just make it a little shinier
4681987 it was you who ran this and it wasnt just to support your habit
4681988 a lot of it was greed and for that you must be punished
4681989 a convicted sexual felon should not be able to live next door to your college student
4681990 theyre living away from home for the first time theyre staying out late i know theyre drinking we need to ensure their safety
4681991 its a real problem to find them a place to live
4681992 people end up living under bridges or in cars we would prefer they have a roof over their heads
4681993 for people to say this isnt a priority because its based on the possibility of harm is just wrong
4681994 for the most part these people have done their time
4681995 were better off educating students and preparing them to take accountability for their own public security
4681996 i think its just a knee jerk reaction to a problem that doesnt exist its going to make things 10 times worse
4681997 she did not intend for things to get this far and that this entire incident did not occur
4681998 lots of luck people at least my wish is something i might get
4681999 help they kidnapped me they wont let me go home or nothing
4682000 i have once again become a medium of violence in the world and once again wish i was not alive
4682001 i know there is good and love in my heart and yet at the same time there is a huge reservoir of hatred evil that drives me to hurt people even those i love
4682002 praying fervently for god to help me but his answers are jumbled and confusing i am driven by my hatred for our society the system while at the same time tortured by my own compassion
4682003 evil is real only because we make it real evil can live in a person and society as well i have been inflicted by an evil demon that is nurtured by our so called criminal justice system but know im still fighting my demons and asking god to guide me as he can
4682004 i am behind a guy who is all over the road
4682005 the police reports will indicate his driving was perfect so there was no justification for the stop
4682006 ive been following him this whole time and he was doing that whole over the shoulder and then go
4682007 back over the center line yeah he was just not driving straight in the lane and he was going from side to side to side to side
4682008 are you willing to file a complaint as to what you witnessed
4682009 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4682010 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4682011 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4682012 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4682013 we apologize for the inconvenience our customers experienced because of the problem with the elwha
4682014 a womans breasts denote a womans character just like her star sign
4682015 she likes eating and wants to be spoiled and admired but seldom likes sex
4682016 while she is self confident and knows her goals she has little interest in sex she likes conversation and partnerships
4682017 this woman may look erotic but in reality is bashful and homely she spoils her partner but prefers tenderness over sex
4682018 these women are full of life and can laugh at themselves they want a balanced life without surprises
4682019 funny and very exciting they are entertaining and intelligent make great partners both for everyday life and on holiday and are moderately interested in sex
4682020 loves love in all its variations she can be very religious but is known to have affairs
4682021 why cant we drink forever i just want to start this over
4682022 you were not able to come to royces service because you did not know how to handle it

4682025 both sides are pulling out their troops and we expect this to be done before sunset today
4682026 everyone looks happy to see the thai troops leaving the area villagers are going back to run their businesses near preah vihear temple
4682027 the march 14 incident had the biggest impact on the service sector in tibet and the tourism industry was significantly impacted
4682028 i was doing weights to tone my legs to help with my athletics to become more powerful
4682029 what you are about to see is a perfect combination of strength and beauty
4682030 i try to smile because thats how i wish to feel after ive lifted
4682031 if you have a doubt before you lift its pretty hard to do it its like positive reinforcement it puts me in the right mindset
4682032 after serious consideration we decided to respond to the bigger picture and terminate the contract unconditionally to ease any worries in society
4682033 in retrospect mr leungs involvement in the handling of the hunghom peninsula development and that one of the subsidiaries of new world development company limited was one of the developers involved had not been considered
4682034 the whole matter has caused much public concern comments and queries on this i would like to express my sincere apologies
4682035 they failed to anticipate the publics perception that as mr leung had made a decision seen to have benefited

4682039 the syura council is the body that decides on matters pertaining to hukum syara the laws of islam which is what keeps pas on track
4682040 some opined that only an unambiguous differentiation from umno through articulating islamic symbols and ideas could save pas from being undercut by the then new prime minister
4682041 rarely is the dewan ulama given room to state its views on matters related to islam in the media including internal media
4682042 we do not want to see only those who are over 40 or 58 joining the dewan ulama

4682051 mijn hamstrings spelen een beetje op maar ik maak me geen zorgen ik wou een goeie 60 meter lopen en dan controleren dat is gelukt
4682052 een mooie eerste ronde belangrijk voor het vertrouwen kim heeft geen kwaaltjes waar we aandacht aan moeten besteden het doel blijft om de finale van de 100 meter te lopen over de rest van het toernooi doen we voorlopig geen uitspraken
4682053 entramos nos jogos da primeira fase preocupados em n o levar gol para depois atacarmos e vencer acho que o estilo de jogo deve ser o mesmo contra camar es

4682055 the time has come for christians to vote for honest men and take consistent ground in politics or the lord will curse them politics are a part of a religion in such a country as this and christians must do their duty to their country as a part of their duty to god
4682056 god will bless or curse this nation according to the course christians take in politics

4682063 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4682064 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4682065 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4682066 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4682067 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4682068 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4682069 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4682070 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4682071 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4682072 i cant say i know authentic hummus but i do know delicious hummus

4682077 im thrilled with the way im playing but you cant relax until sunday night
4682078 his desire to be a marine went beyond blowing things up and being a warrior
4682079 he loves this country and everything that it stands for
4682080 dan was always eager to be a part of the skits and to get the kids laughing
4682081 dan had very strong beliefs and he believed in the cause for which he was fighting
4682082 he died doing something he believed he was called by god to do
4682083 he was a very personable warm and handsome young man he was highly respected by adults and his peers
4682084 people who get the most out of life are the ones who take the time to stop and look around them and experience not just the moment but the things in the moment
4682085 he grew up a lot in the last year or so
4682086 my son one of the few one of the proud a marine
4682087 i didnt really do much its not a drastic change

4682094 miller im in the area im with some friends we want to see you tonight fetch me three of your most fabulous friends and lets have a night dont worry about prices darling dinner is on me

4682096 this appears to be a great tragedy from everybodys standpoint
4682097 as the states population grows and use of outdoor recreational areas increases we must be sure were doing everything we can to protect all users
4682098 lets cap off our lovely date with this mouthwatering cake and then go make out
4682099 i want to get a little fresh air and exercise and cut my carbon footprint and spend less money on gas and where i live i can ride my bike seven months out of the year
4682100 if youve got a date you go to meet friends you go out on a conventional bike youre gonna sweat up you go out in an electric bike its great its terrific youre not gonna sweat up and you ride home fine
4682101 fifty percent of that increase is probably because of gas prices and the rest is that theres just more bikes out there
4682102 when i started there was only one bike that had a nickel metal hydride battery everything else was lead acid and was 80 or 90 pounds
4682103 the new designs that weve seen in the marketplace are going to inure to the benefit of the electric bike companies
4682104 a year ago when you mentioned the word electric bike people looked at you and they really werent sure what it was
4682105 today what were finding is were actually having dealers call us seeking an electric bike to meet the demand
4682106 did you know there are 70 million electric bikes on the road today in china and they are selling at the rate of 2 6 million electric bikes a year
4682107 the public at large needs to understand that it is the right thing to do to move to electric transportation and electric bikes and electric scooters will allow you to do that to get that familiarity
4682108 i ran out of my house to join 10 people trying to lift up the bus
4682109 at first we couldnt get it up so then another 10 people ran over to help and we got the bus up and the lady out
4682110 the light turned red and i couldnt stop i tried to miss her
4682111 its a terrible poignancy that donnettes sons birthday will now coincide with the day his mother died

4682117 drugs can be utilized to achieve abnormal diseased or disordered psychology
4682118 it is possible that some day there could be a technique developed to extract information from a prisoner that does not have any lasting side effects
4682119 i suspected something when i found the first bird in gabon since it didnt exactly match any of the species descriptions in the field guides
4682120 once i was able to compare them side by side to other specimens in our collections it was clear that these birds were special you of course have to be cautious but i was still very excited at the prospect of possibly having found a new species of bird
4682121 although finding an unknown species like the olive backed forest robin was not the goal of the mab project
4682122 it is definitely a reminder that the world still holds surprises for us
4682123 this may very well become the most devastating marine invasion in history
4682124 there is probably no way to stop the invasion completely
4682125 but weve not seen such a large predatory invasion in the ocean before
4682126 i think at the best they will have a huge impact on reef fish and at the worst will result in the disappearance of most reef fish
4682127 it was so painful it made me want to cut my own hand off
4682128 we have gotten sharks to successfully eat a lionfish but it has been a lot of work most of our attempts with the moray eel have been unsuccessful
4682129 our dear neighbours to the south have come up with a new method for boosting their budget each month around a dozen estonians are forced to pay fines at latvias borders because in their enthusiasm about a europe without borders they forget to carry travel documents under the schengen agreement there are no more controls at internal borders so you can travel from tallinn to helsinki or riga in the same way you would travel to tartu but if you read the small print you see that although the border crossing points have disappeared there are still controls and the fine for forgetting your documents can be as hefty as 200 euros in latvia
4682130 location has been a problem and at times the ball doesnt have that finishing kick its had in the past
4682131 but location has been a big a problem as anything larry and i have talked about it quite a few times you know he just depends on his fastball so much maybe mix in a little split finger once in awhile or something i dont know
4682132 weve tried to rest him a little bit weve tried keeping him pitching regular weve tried to overuse him a little bit and hes shown at times where here he comes and then he seems to struggle i hope he can finish strong hes an excellent young man a no excuse guy you like to see people like that do well
4682133 the trainer said he was sore and left it at that
4682134 im happy to give my permission the only condition is that you will let me know when the band is formed and that at some mutually convenient time youll play at a picnic for me good luck
4682135 life should not be a journey to the grave with the intention of arriving safely in an attractive and well preserved body but rather to skid in sideways chocolate in one hand martini in the other body thoroughly used up totally worn out and screaming

4682141 i met with the operator of the mv reasons bevins who stated that he had already given a statement to the coast guard and had been in touch with his attorney via cell phone and was advised to invoke his fifth amendment rights
4682142 we just had a collision with a sailboat we ran over that sailboat theres one missing the guy who was at the helm is missing hold on a sec the guy i swear he came out of nowhere
4682143 i was setting waypoint on gps looked up to see sailboat in front of me no time to avoid crash
4682144 in addition video from the coast guard helicopter shows both sails in the up position flapping
4682145 point of impact and angle of impact along with the severe damage to the sailboats helm area hull structure and transfer evidence from the motorboat along with the damage and transfer evidence on the bottom of the hull shafts and propellers of the motorboat are consistent with the motorboat striking the sailboat and running over the helm stern of the sailboat
4682146 preliminary findings in this case indicate that there was an insufficient lookout being maintained on the m v reasons as required by state and federal law and that the s v priority had the right of way in terms of the rules of nautical passage

4682152 the protester got what it asked for which was clarification of exactly what is required
4682153 there was no mystery to us as to what the requirements of the system were in the past
4682154 rather than favoring one company or the other our view is that it favors the war fighter
4682155 id be happy for those guys to get some snaps
4682156 hes close its more of an irritation now than an injury i would say so were just going to play that one a little easy
4682157 but its nothing i would think that he could play in a game if he had to
4682158 i had a tight back earlier in the week i probably shouldnt have said anything the hardest part is just standing around ironically
4682159 it felt tight when we landed in minnesota and got worse not better
4682160 our thing weve been experimenting and looking is to feel enough confidence in charlies ability to do the job that i can use seneca in other things

4682162 all the coaches feedback has been man youve really smoothed that motion out
4682163 coaching a guys throwing motion even though some guys say they can do it its hard to coach a guy whos been doing it a certain way for so long but he is trying
4682164 thrown straight up in the air like a missile and came straight down
4682165 last night they told me theres a strong chance of her being in a coma for 12 to 18 months
4682166 not to jump on motorcycles without being with an experienced rider
4682167 there have been droves and droves of people about 100 a day
4682168 i feel rex has made improvement like the rest of our ballclub has
4682169 were not ready for the first game yet and you shouldnt be we dont want to necessarily peak yet we have three more games
4682170 but we know we need to make a decision so we can start getting the timing and everything else going
4682171 those two are battling for a starting job i can remember just battling for a job if you dont play the best game of your life here then you probably dont have a job next week
4682172 in terms of a football career it was life or death
4682173 packers tickets were hard to come by but the toughest ticket for me was the preseason i would have all my friends come out and family come for the preseason then during the regular season i was just giving my tickets away to teammates
4682174 im excited youre working with the guys who will be playing in the games its great
4682175 obviously we were a little disappointed in that first drive against k c
4682176 we did run a vanilla defense i think were going to open up our package a little bit more this weekend we definitely want to have a different feeling than we did after the kansas city game
4682177 the gps collars will tell us much more about the daily and seasonal movements of the goats which is particularly useful during the winter when we cant get into the mountains due to heavy snow
4682178 its important that we know as much as possible about them
4682179 hes an amazing and far reaching presence literally in that he was able to effectively direct an entire project from thousands of miles away
4682180 the field supervisor gives me a report on whats happening and we can share files pictures on our computer screens
4682181 for instance if we have aerial photos and i want them to excavate a certain area i can circle the place we want to talk about and they can make comments on the screen
4682182 the speed of the system is only as good as the weakest link
4682183 he would be awake at 4 a m and want to read reports online
4682184 when you cant sleep i figure you might as well get up and do something so i did
4682185 he loves having her there and sharing this passion of his
4682186 its not like standing there and walking around and smelling the soil
4682187 with good people in the field this is a nice alternative
4682188 navy seals are 180 degrees out from the coast guard a different breed
4682189 since 9 11 our safety and security missions have grown considerably and we must continue to learn and increase our specialty knowledge by providing our personnel with the requisite skills
4682190 we have about four coast guard slots for a seal class in the february time frame
4682191 were having a hell of a time keeping the adults out
4682192 when i was a kid all i had was a bicycle and a place i wasnt supposed to go
4682193 our membership has skewed a lot younger than what we originally anticipated
4682194 kids became a lot bigger part it wasnt just retirees like most country clubs have done in the past
4682195 the kids would rather hang out here than get a baby sitter
4682196 my younger one who is 9 they were going to build a room on for her because she was there so much
4682197 i thought there was a good selection of things to do
4682198 the kids really never seem to get bored it was a little cold of a summer for a lot of lake swimming so i think the pool came in handy
4682199 the biggest artists event amp producer battle on the eastside
4682200 we have been sort of like john mccain but not co goodbye tim russert
4682201 these lakes are fed by hydrothermal waters that leach out arsenic containing minerals from the surrounding rocks
4682202 we suspected that these bacteria were using arsenic to make a living so we scraped the biofilms off the rock and studied them under laboratory conditions
4682203 we think that bacteria were photosynthesizing before oxygen was present in the atmosphere
4682204 increased risk of catastrophic wildfires global warmings wake up call for the western united states
4682205 its something that needs to be considered in greenhouse gas emissions inventory as we go forward
4682206 unfortunately many of our policymakers dont seem to have taken that message to heart
4682207 we need to be looking at new policies that look to reduce the human footprint in forest landscapes
4682208 its not just california thats experiencing these problems its throughout the western united states
4682209 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem
4682210 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4682211 its getting to be a problem of such a magnitude that it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4682212 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth
4682213 its not sort of a local or regional problem which is how it was thought of in the past
4682214 most of it is agricultural based but there is a lot of industrial nitrogen in there too if you consider electric generation industrial
4682215 the farmers would certainly prefer to have their fertilizer on the land rather than floating down the river
4682216 there have been many more reported but there truly are many more what has happened in the industrialized nations with agribusiness as well that led to increased flux of nutrients from the land to the estuaries and the seas is now happening in developing countries
4682217 is that big brains enhance the rate of evolutionary diversification by facilitating changes in behavior which would place new selection pressures on populations and favor adaptive divergence
4682218 brain size and the diversification of body size in birds
4682219 we really have to face the fact that mistakes are made in museums just as they are made anywhere else
4682220 museums are in the habit of hiding these things away
4682221 whether its because weve paid for it or someone with a fancy degree said it was genuine once we make a decision everything that happens after that gets piled in one basket and that is to vindicate the decision
4682222 i think in practical terms we have much better equipment for conservation studies and we would now ask more questions but you can never be really sure
4682223 if someone has a glass eye you can tell that something isnt quite right and a work of art is not so different it has a kind of integrity
4682224 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4682225 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4682226 and if those deals do happen there will be some more players coming in
4682227 james is the last player newcastle want to sell and im taking about the owner and myself james wont be leaving here im sure of that i dont want to lose alan smith either hes great around the place he just needs a goal
4682228 with an aim of finish it by the coming autumn
4682229 the probe would look into anyone whom japan suspects was kidnapped
4682230 china and japan are cooperation partners with neither side posing any threat to the other
4682231 based on model analysis at the beginning of the year our conclusion is that this years prices are going to be high for the first half year and low for the second up until now our judgment remains the same
4682232 i have once again become a medium of violence in the world
4682233 inflicted by an evil demon that is nurtured by our so called criminal justice system
4682234 i dont know what god wants for me i just dont know
4682235 help they kidnapped me they wont let me go home or nothing

4682244 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4682245 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4682246 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4682247 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining

4682256 for the first quarter of fiscal 2009 techprecision reported sales of 11
4682257 the 0 9 million increase in net income reflected the strong demand for the companys products and services particularly in the alternative energy market the increase is also attributable to its continued improvement on its operational efficiencies and in refocusing its business towards precision manufacturing and complete integration services for high volume production programs
4682258 precision castparts corp pcp shares slightly climbed friday morning moving less than 1 or 11 cents to 98 98 precision castparts manufactures metal components and products primarily in the united states and the united kingdom
4682259 the board of directors of precision castparts has recently declared a quarterly cash dividend of three cents on the companys common stock payable on september 29 2008 to shareholders of record at the close of business september 5 2008

4682261 whenever i tell people what im doing theres always that look the furrowed brow and then the im sorry
4682262 most people are like if its under your sink for a week you dont want it there
4682263 ive never heard of anyone wanting to save that stuff
4682264 if i had totally thought it through i might not have done it
4682265 i never feel like i was being preached to with dave its like learn by example

4682267 we do not compete on price or promotion regardless of macroeconomic conditions although it may be both easy and tempting to drive short term sales with pricing and promotional efforts
4682268 we will not sacrifice this investment and growth plan for short term results
4682269 we see further aspirational positioning of the abercrombie brands despite weak retail sales trends and expect this brand strategy to pay back in second half
4682270 we still asking everyone to cut back but were not seeing a big reduction yet

4682279 mr greenwood youre violating a subdivision rule that prohibits pickup trucks in your driveway
4682280 the first flight was a success and made the first in situ measurements of gases in a volcanic plume using meteorological balloons
4682281 with flight visualization using google earth we were looking at tropospheric volcanic emissions of sulfur dioxide carbon dioxide and water which can be hazardous to human and animal health and degrade ecosystems
4682282 we could count the rows of trees to find the balloon
4682283 we are fairly confident of three findings first this work is feasible for measuring sulfur dioxide so2 and carbon dioxide co2 in volcanic emissions for several hours after eruptions second there is a loss of so2 after one hour of flight away from the source which could reflect conversion to sulfate aerosol which may lower the earths temperature by reflecting away solar radiation and third there is a clear stratification of so2 above co2 within the plumes
4682284 one of the largest subdivisions in america is ocean view and it is downwind from the volcano on the west side of the island
4682285 we detected sulfur dioxide over the development several hours after it was erupted into the atmosphere
4682286 lobsters know when their shell is damaged and thats probably the reason when they have shell disease why they molt more quickly
4682287 but ultimately they still come down with the disease and we think the presence of alkyphenols contributes to that
4682288 plastics last a long time but breakdown products last even longer perhaps shell disease is only the tip of the iceberg of a more basic problem of endocrine disrupting chemicals in marine environments
4682289 its called the american dream because you have to be asleep to beleive it
4682290 blind knowledge is working at useless ground and crazy faith is living the dream of its liturgy a new god is a word or the mere sound dont seek and dont trust for all is mystery

4682294 it is appalling and it reflects the underlying prejudice and a discriminating attitude towards travellers
4682295 this decision is being taken on the assumption that travellers will misbehave or wreck the place its appalling in this day and age and it sends a very bad message to a wider society youd imagine it would be a business opportunity and it makes the decision all the more bizarre
4682296 the front of borris house which has been beautifully landscaped with trees has been fenced off
4682297 people do like the one day fair if the traders take all their unsold goods and litter and use the skips provided
4682298 its when traders and travellers come in three days before the fair that it puts huge pressure on the village
4682299 everybody loves walking up and down the town for the fair but what we dont want are the headlines the next day we hope borris wont be left in a poor state
4682300 shouldnt be allowed to go ahead it just messes up the whole place
4682301 mijn hamstrings spelen een beetje op maar ik maak me geen zorgen ik wou een goeie 60 meter lopen en dan controleren dat is gelukt
4682302 een mooie eerste ronde belangrijk voor het vertrouwen kim heeft geen kwaaltjes waar we aandacht aan moeten besteden het doel blijft om de finale van de 100 meter te lopen over de rest van het toernooi doen we voorlopig geen uitspraken
4682303 i was starting to hurt a little bit with probably the last 10 meters that was my last individual race so i was just trying to finish as strong as i could
4682304 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4682305 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4682306 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4682307 i dont know if you saw me come through the fence over there
4682308 i was ready to go im getting chills just being out here on this field all of knoxville was out here you want to play in front of everybody
4682309 this is the first time ive put these pads on these pants since nov 9 i was ready to unleash on everybody in warmups i was going crazy
4682310 there were a couple of times i walked in his office in the offseason and said coach you got to let me play in the jamboree or something
4682311 hes done a great job this is his first year playing running back
4682312 weve had to get our young guys a lot of experience in a hurry before the opener
4682313 hes still a sophomore but hes got a lot of upside to him we look forward to seeing him grow and becoming a more complete football player lot of talent hopefully we can help him out along the way
4682314 your site is very informative n helpful thanks keep it up
4682315 were not real big on pointing fingers or attaching blame or airing this out in public
4682316 i said if you dont like seeing people in drag go back to yakima and four of them piled out of the car
4682317 guys started kneeing me in the face and got on me and started punching me and im taking this from the account of my friend because i sort of blacked out at that point
4682318 when you go from extreme high water to low water that has a tendency to leave behind significant sediment and it shifts channels unexpectedly
4682319 when you have a flood you get a combination of sediment and soil coming off the farm fields and golf courses and streets and yards
4682320 also the energy from the flow picks up sand off the bottom of the river it swirls it all together in this milky hazy mixture that comes down the river during flooding

4682324 a large number of exhibitors at informexusa have the capability to serve the biopharmaceutical industry because of their expertise in small molecule drug manufacturing
4682325 small molecule drug manufacturing and biopharmaceutical production share a number of similarities
4682326 informexusa 2009 will include a biotechnology component as a way to bring together the biopharmaceutical and chemical industries for the purpose of technical advancements in drug manufacturing
4682327 rising energy prices and the search for more sustainable technologies has manufacturers in a variety of industries back in the marketplace looking to the chemical industry for answers
4682328 we have responded to these requests with the addition of the green chemistry forum and pavilion in 2009
4682329 we are disappointed that the province of saskatchewan determined that the bids for these oil sands exploratory permits were not acceptable the acquisition of the permits fits within the companys mission to acquire explore and develop unconventional oil in western canada and therefore we intend to ask the province to re post these permits for bidding
4682330 the members of the buffalo river dene nation are very disappointed that the province did not grant the oil sands exploratory permits to access energy so that the company can begin exploration work which in turn will lead to employment infrastructure improvements capacity building and eventually self sustainability for our members
4682331 these mineral rights are located under crown resource lands administered by the saskatchewan ministry of environment

4682337 this is an old art falconry in the truest sense of the word is hunting wild game with trained birds of prey
4682338 what you see here is falconry techniques used to demonstrate the birds capabilities and to give you an up close look at birds of prey which are magnificent
4682339 weve always seen those types of exhibits on tv this seemed like it would be a nice thing to do and see the birds in action theyre beautiful
4682340 a bird can be trained not only to not fear you but to actually come to you for a reward why it works i dont know quite frankly its still a miracle to me
4682341 thats because this is a lot more demanding than your average gun hunt

4682344 this afternoon ive been on the limit all the time and its been difficult to increase the gap
4682345 there are lots of tough new stages tomorrow so it will be interesting to see what happens
4682346 its never an easy thing to walk away from the all whites jersey but i feel the time is right
4682347 i loved my time in europe every kid dreams of playing professionally in europe and i have been able to live that dream but now its time to be with my family
4682348 i like the idea of been able to work with and help in developing kids
4682349 we learnt an important lesson out of the petero civoniceva incident and were determined to do everything in our power to make sure the misbehaviour of a few does not ruin things for the vast majority of fans
4682350 weve identified a number of people who are known for unacceptable behaviour and in some cases we have banned them for extended periods
4682351 the message is clear if you misbehave you will be caught and action will be taken
4682352 ive often said we have the best fans in the league and through their actions they continue to prove it
4682353 we want our home games to be a place people are comfortable coming to and i believe were very close to ensuring that
4682354 the epa is the authority on the clean water act
4682355 lets cut to the chase and ask epa to make a determination
4682356 its a missed opportunity one we will never get back one that falls squarely on the shoulders of the bush administration which is rushing through bad fiscal policy in its waning days
4682357 our numbers were based upon public documents we didnt make things up
4682358 if the operator doesnt know what theyre doing thats a lot of money to have exposed
4682359 knew full well of the stipulations included in the roan plan for protecting wildlife water and our environment and yet they still insisted the sale would bring in 2 billion
4682360 so it is very disingenuous of industry lobbyists to now say that the stipulations were the reason the bids were so low
4682361 if he complies with all the terms of the agreement itll get dismissed
4682362 the dark cloud of uncertainty cast by these elected officials and the environmental groups through their lease sale protests lawsuits and rulemaking efforts grossly impacted the value of the roan
4682363 the blms decision to lease the entire top of the roan plateau all at once

4682380 to me a segmented federalistic system may not be in accordance with the constitution
4682381 i dont think this is the best time to talk about federalism because there is a danger that president arroyo would take advantage of charter change to extend her term
4682382 no government has the moral ascendancy to push charter change at the tail end of its term
4682383 the end goal of all these moves is to have a gloria forever movement
4682384 we can all resume this federalism proposal after her term ends
4682385 where final decisions are dispersed among local governments representing specific and sometimes overlapping geographical areas these governmental units have as constituents people of different social political moral and economic persuasions
4682386 equitable share in the proceeds of the utilization and development of the national wealth
4682387 developed as a response to the need to link separate political communities together in order to pursue effectively objectives that each could not obtain on its own but without subsuming their respective identities
4682388 didnt you find that unethical did you berate your brother
4682389 it never occurred o me im sorry for that i should have done that
4682390 what really transpired and what you want me to say once asked this question
4682391 from the beginning an unseen hand of a powerful figure in the gsis was trying to destroy justice roxas
4682392 establishing a system of life and governance suitable and acceptable to the bangsamoro people
4682393 our official position is that the agreement on ancestral domain has been signed so its a done deal
4682394 all the performances will have one objective which is to open our peoples eyes to the truths that can no longer be disregarded using fresh and entertaining means
4682395 in spite of real differences of points of view personalities ideologies we progressed from one consensus to the other we actually learned to disagree agreeably and this learning together to work for a common cause is worthy of celebrating and long after the truthfest has come and gone and the euphoria would die away we will remember this process and maybe this is an exercise and a model for genuine nation building where people offer their gift of diversity and come to a unity in fulfilling a vision of a transformed society
4682396 joint resolution to convene the congress into a constituent assembly for the purpose of revising the constitution to establish a federal system of government

4682407 dominos had been running the summer of success program for 15 students
4682408 the guest speakers were interesting and the stories they shared were really hard to do
4682409 they showed the opportunities we have there are no excuses not to do what we want to do
4682410 this program sounded like a good idea but i didnt think it would be as good as it was the stories were really inspirational
4682411 it taught us what we can do to be successful
4682412 it pointed out the hardships and how to overcome them no matter how hard things are if you persevere you can succeed
4682413 there are barriers but those are excuses you have to move around the barriers the gifts and talents inside you will drive you to the decisions you make sometimes youll make bad decisions but you can always go back

4682427 when i was at the wharton school of business id watch him every night
4682428 today the administration and the blm turned their backs yet again on western slope communities
4682429 the circus was complete when the governor joined environmental legal challenges that in the end massively undercut the financial returns on the roan that the governor once claimed to be so concerned about
4682430 this is our resource by leasing it all at once you get an undervalued price the federal government has done a disservice to our state
4682431 the people who bought these leases dont know whether those protests will be dealt with in a matter of months or a matter of decades
4682432 i guess the environmental community or whoever was responsible for those protests should recognize the disservice they have done the citizens
4682433 as an elected official and a taxpayer i am very disappointed
4682434 if there are not at least 10 bids for those assets they ought to reject all bids and start over
4682435 today is a sad day for colorado its a missed opportunity one we will never get back one that falls squarely on the shoulders of the bush administration which is rushing through bad fiscal policy in its waning days
4682436 someone got a bargain in todays sell off and it wasnt the american people
4682437 today was a fire sale it was all because of the political poison that gov ritter and sen salazar have injected into the project
4682438 the roan plateau has become a legal and political circus a colorado case study of whats wrong with american energy policy the circus was complete when the governor joined environmental legal challenges that in the end massively undercut the financial returns on the roan that the governor once claimed to be so concerned about
4682439 this sale is the ultimate symbol of the heavy thumb of the energy industry and the bush administration crushing the will and needs of local communities and drowning out the voices of citizens concerned about public health and air and water quality

4682442 i think it is going to be machinery versus emotion
4682443 i was fighting pure and raw emotion then i went through it and i know how difficult it can be umno has a powerful machinery but emotion is a very irrational feeling and although the feelings are not raw now as in 1999 it will still be very challenging

4682472 how can we disrupt the enemys motivation to fight how can we make people trust us more what if we could help the brain to remove fear or pain is there a way to make the enemy obey our commands
4682473 i think most reasonable people if they imagine a world in which all sides have figured out how to control brains theyd rather not go there
4682474 most rational human beings would believe that if we could have a world where nobody does military neuroscience well all be better off but for some people in the pentagon its too delicious to ignore
4682475 madonna michael jackson and prince are considered obsolete today as pop figures their industry has long sworn by nothing other than the intensity of the moment so the question of what future they face goes to the heart of pop culture in the times before pop consciousness the question of age was relatively easily solved as long as the authenticity of the stage performance was more important than its artificiality it seemed the most sensible thing not to get old at all on their 50th birthdays madonna michael jackson and prince stand at a crossroads whose destinations have not yet been defined or only negatively pop is the lightness of being in which one thing should remain invisible namely that it is also work the image machine that pop has always been has still found no proper images for old age

4682496 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4682497 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4682498 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4682499 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4682500 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century

4682533 i also have to recognize the support of david and dan glass and the great work of our scouting staff for helping to get eric into our organization
4682534 the launch of airfarescout com is a giant step forward for consumers
4682535 it will let them know which travel agencies and websites filter out low fare information and which do not

4682538 with zoning even if youre doing a variance its a minimum of a year

4682540 a lot of people are saying usain and tyson are very fast finishers but if i get out in front of them no matter how they are finishing they wont even be close to me
4682541 i did some great things in practice the past couple of weeks this is the first time ive seen my coach so excited so all i have to do is go there and just be like i was in the last two races and do it
4682542 its not necessary to get a new world record in beijing i have done that setting a world record five times and those just happened accidentally it just comes naturally
4682543 i would be the winner if i could run like i am supposed to
4682544 its being said that its a little hot here so the final decision on running the 5 000 race will be made after the 10 000
4682545 it was what it was it hasnt sunk in yet
4682546 a typical session consists of practising every event for about an hour a lot of people assume i have private coaching but i work out with 13 other girls at the gym
4682547 my parents put me in gymnastics when i was three because i had too much energy around the house
4682548 should confer a significant advantage and differentiation to this effort
4682549 dance shows always do well but it has to be adapted for trends working on tv
4682550 its quite a positive show theres not a lot meanness that may exist in other reality programming
4682551 for a lot of people it reminds them of the time when tv wasnt so hostile
4682552 our show was really more about watching the creativity happen and contestants learning the choreography in a different sub genre each week
4682553 dancers are dramatic and emotional and i think its really compelling to watch
4682554 what these shows have replaced is what we no longer have a large support for the arts
4682555 the government no longer supports the arts theyre not fed like they were
4682556 weve seen a big increase in interest since the shows went on air
4682557 weve done a lot of ballroom classes and choreographed dances for weddings dance is on the brain
4682558 of course some of these shows are not for the dance purist
4682559 but it has such a domino effect on dance and getting people to think about dance its really just fantastic
4682560 people know the difference they see how hard these dancers work and realize that its a skill
4682561 at the same time it may inspire them to learn something new
4682562 in 18 years of taking part in debates i have never seen an incident like this one
4682563 we had a hail storm that hurt us really bad two years ago
4682564 im not going to get paid signature gatherers im a teacher im not rich
4682565 any wrongful conduct that affects interrupts or interferes with performance of official duty
4682566 is supported by the record and demonstrated by the fact that the port commission had to hold a public meeting in order to undo comm daviss contract with dinsmore
4682567 davis understood her duties as port commissioner and the legal necessity of voting in public session before potentially obligating the port in any monetary agreement and for purposes of recall intentionally acted outside the scope of these duties by signing an agreement with dinsmore
4682568 in the hands of voters now and i think it needs to run its course
4682569 we continue to believe that our revised proposal would provide superior value to republic stockholders and with republics cooperation would be executable on a timely basis
4682570 i dont think waste management is ready to walk away its becoming a lot more complicated
4682571 republic believes the best long term for the shareholders is its deal with allied
4682572 how willing is waste management to pay 40 thats the price that would have to be paid i think its a good deal at 40
4682573 in the long term yes its a large competitor well capitalized competing against you you have to take that into consideration
4682574 the law was written broadly enough that it swept in speech that was protected as well as speech that could be threatening

4682576 harassment and annoyance are among common reactions to seeing or hearing gestures or words that one finds unpleasant
4682577 buyers see and hear stories about the collapse of the national housing market everywhere and that makes them afraid to move forward with a purchase
4682578 much of the savings in prices was consumed by higher interest rates leaving buyers frustrated that they are not benefiting from price declines as they expected
4682579 marrying for love may be a bit risky but it is so honest that god cant help but smile on it
4682580 the most important thing you can get in your life is an education once you have it no one can take it away from you
4682581 recreating large sections of yosemite national park is a little beyond my skills
4682582 hes actually made up of a yellow lego spaceman with his body on backwards so you cant see the space insignia
4682583 i tried but he looked too much like a woman the face i chose seemed to fit with the jesus look of the original
4682584 it took a long time to get all of the elements to work together
4682585 there was a lot of scenery that really liked to float away
4682586 its a similar effect to the lego versions of darth vader or the stormtroopers
4682587 taking something serious and menacing and replacing that with something cute harmless and funny
4682588 lego dont make sailor figures as far as i can tell
4682589 my normal working practice if something doesnt work is to add more lego stormtroopers
4682590 i was going to set a lego figure on fire for this but i couldnt bring myself to destroy lego
4682591 unfortunately my 80s classic spacemen were a bit too broken and chewed to use for that shot
4682592 i have never been excluded from the russian team i have not been tested this year i dont know what is happening around me i have trained on my own over the past months
4682593 my dream has come true i was lagging behind at the beginning this was not really my strategy
4682594 i wanted to run as easy as possible and come up with the slowest time i could
4682595 i came out to win gold that would be the icing on the cake for me
4682596 a great multitude is coming against you from edom from beyond the sea and behold they are in hazazontamar
4682597 o lord god of our fathers art thou not god in heaven dost thou not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations in thy hand are power and might so that none is able to withstand thee didst thou not o our god drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and give it for ever to the descendants of abraham thy friend and they have dwelt in it and have built thee in it a sanctuary for thy name saying if evil comes upon us the sword judgment or pestilence or famine we will stand before this house and before thee for thy name is in this house and cry to thee in our affliction and thou wilt hear and save and now behold the men of ammon and moab and mount seir whom thou wouldst not let israel invade when they came from the land of egypt and whom they avoided and did not destroy behold they reward us by coming to drive us out of thy possession which thou has given us to inherit o our god wilt thou not execute judgment upon them for we are powerless against this great multitude that is coming against us we do not know what to do but our eyes are upon thee
4682598 hearken all judah and inhabitants of jerusalem and king jehoshaphat thus says the lord to you fear not and be not dismayed at this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods tomorrow go down against them behold they will come up by the ascent of ziz you will find them at the end of the valley east of the wilderness of jeruel you will not need to fight in this battle only take your position stand still and see the victory of the lord on your behalf o judah and jerusalem fear not and be not dismayed tomorrow go out against them and the lord will be with you
4682599 hear me judah and inhabitants of jerusalem believe in the lord your god and you will be established believe his prophets and you will succeed
4682600 give thanks to the lord for his steadfast love endures forever
4682601 his heart was courageous in the ways of the lord
4682602 and the fear of the lord fell upon all the kingdoms of the lands that were round about judah and they made no war against jehoshaphat
4682603 after this the moabites and ammonites and with them some of the meumites came against jehoshaphat for battle
4682604 then jehoshaphat feared and set himself to seek the lord and proclaimed a fast throughout all judah and judah assembled to seek help from the lord from all the cities of judah they came to seek the lord
4682605 o lord god of our fathers art thou not god in heaven dost thou not rule over all the kingdoms of the nations in thy hand are power and might so that none is able to withstand thee
4682606 didst thou not o our god drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people israel and give it for ever to the descendants of abraham thy friend
4682607 o our god wilt thou not execute judgment upon them for we are powerless against this great multitude that is coming against us we do not know what to do but our eyes are upon thee
4682608 hearken all judah and inhabitants of jerusalem and king jehoshaphat thus says the lord to you fear not and be not dismayed at this great multitude for the battle is not yours but gods you will not need to fight in this battle take your position stand still and see the victory of the lord on your behalf o judah and jerusalem fear not and be not dismayed tomorrow go out against them and the lord will be with you
4682609 then jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground and all judah and the inhabitants of jerusalem fell down before the lord worshiping the lord
4682610 and the levites of the kohathites and the korahites stood up to praise the lord the god of israel with a very loud voice
4682611 these are the men whom david put in charge of the service of song in the house of the lord after the ark rested there
4682612 and then the descendants of kohath the son of levi are given

4682802 romanian pensions are embarrasingly low compared with the rest of the eu
4682803 elderly people wear fashionable hairstyles and new suits while retired pairs drive around in convertibles in spain pensions are four times in belgium six times and in luxembourg ten times higher than the romanian average of around 140 euros other european countries are trying to raise the retirement age while here the laws encourage lowering rather than raising it nowhere in the world has raising the retirement age been met with sympathy but here politicians do not lose a word over it yet a national study calls for an end to early retirement and concludes it is urgent that the retirement age be raised not because people have a huge desire go on working but because in ten or twenty years pensions in romania will be at starvation levels

4682833 its going to take some time to get back into the flow of things
4682834 liza has been our leading goal scorer the last couple of seasons and she has a real presence on the field
4682835 shes one of the most dangerous strikers in our conference and shes more of a scorer than a playmaker
4682836 we had a lot of players get hurt we were never at full strength and that was something we had to deal with in every game
4682837 we only had 11 players to go to at the end of the season and we all did the best that we could
4682838 weve brought in some good young players and were going to have a lot more depth to work with this season
4682839 were going to have a better cast of supporting players around liza this season and were hoping that will really open things up for her on offense
4682840 liza is a strong player shes tenacious and shes a very hard worker shes good in the air and she has a strong shot with either foot
4682841 were going to try to get the ball to her a lot were going to encourage her to take the ball to the net and shoot it good things happen for us when she has the ball and were glad we have her for two more years
4682842 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4682843 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4682844 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4682845 i look at it as these guys talking to us
4682846 its them coming back and saying we appreciate what you have done
4682847 i didnt know the path we would take to get here but i really believed that we would get here
4682848 i knew the money would come because i knew that we were doing gods work
4682849 it was just a matter of sticking with it and focusing on the right things
4682850 when we went to them and asked for support it wasnt let me think about it
4682851 it was everybody believing in that goal and working together
4682852 this isnt an individual achievement its what we have accomplished as a team
4682853 were working on the final touch up fixing little nicks and scratches and dings
4682854 from the families all the way to the guys out here swinging a hammer everyone was behind each other helping each other out
4682855 we want to train and work with the u s army
4682856 we like our job here of running the traffic control point and providing security at the entrance of the patrol base
4682857 right now the iraqi soldiers have taken over the responsibility of the traffic control point but we are going to train them to be able to take over the entire patrol base go and do presence patrols and set up temporary traffic control points in our area
4682858 we are integrating with the iraqi security forces to make us a better fighting force
4682859 they have stepped up to the plate and their partnership is why we are able to take over the mission that the georgians had to leave behind with no change in the security and safety of the iraqi people
4682860 i want to fight fiercely alongside the u s army
4682861 i get more training to be able to do the job
4682862 in my name and your local ip sons names we are promising god and our country to protect our citizens respect and obey the law and stop all the violations
4682863 the ip station has been functioning for the past four months but has not been recognized by the government of iraq until today
4682864 the iraqis now have a local police force to protect the people and handle the routine activities and business related to security here in radwaniyah
4682865 this opening today is a great day and marks a new beginning for the government of iraq and the people of radwaniyah
4682866 we have a very tight bond with the people of radwaniyah the tribal support council and the u s army and coalition forces work hand in hand to provide security for this area
4682867 the radwaniyah security forces of the rashid district worked with the good people of radwaniyah to achieve sustainable security and we see that here today with the opening of the police station
4682868 when i took that last stroke i thought i lost the race there but it turns out that was the difference im just lost for words
4682869 i had to take my goggles off first to make sure the one was next to my name when i saw the 50 58 and the 50 59 and i saw the one next to my name thats when i sort of let my roar out im happy we have a good race tomorrow that im looking forward to
4682870 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4682871 it was clear from the video it was a matter of stroking one was stroking phelps and the other was gliding
4682872 i saw a replay a few minutes after the race and i heard a few things about a protest but im not thinking about it
4682873 its great to win a medal i know i had a long finish and phelps had a short finish im not angry
4682874 beforehand bob bowman said it would be good for me if i lost when he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it and when i saw the finish i said wow
4682875 we are indebted to the physicians and caregivers at peking union medical college hospital who have done such a wonderful job providing barbara with the medical care she needed
4682876 mentally i was like okay im ready to go im ready to do this
4682877 i was a lot different than last time but just to tackle whatever it was 12 swims again was very challenging and just a little more than i thought it was going to be
4682878 you really cant stick your nose up at three olympic medals
4682879 it looks like a costume a waterlogged costume thats been stuffed into a freezer
4682880 it just doesnt have the hallmark of a real corpse
4682881 but the fact remains they are untested and we have doubts whether pakistan could deliver on those plans
4682882 getting eight teams around to training and games in two centres is a massive logistical exercise and with the current situation there i dont know if the military could handle it
4682883 our guys listened patiently and asked some very pertinent questions i thought but i didnt get the impression that any of them were convinced about the safety of the situation
4682884 the dollar is on fire again so thats causing people to re evaluate everything
4682885 it means oil prices could fall dramatically we could see prices get to double digits if this continues
4682886 theyre basically saying we could have an oil glut because demand is slowing
4682887 its obvious that high prices do slow down demand and the market works

4682893 if he continues to stick to his position and does not resign it will create a situation leaving the government with no option but to ask the army chief to intervene and help resolve the political crisis
4682894 general kayani will be asked to intervene if the president does not show flexibility
4682895 the president is confident that they will not let him down to face a humiliating ouster at the hands of the political parties

4682918 as we were looking at ms hawks circle one name stood out clearly and that was dave hawk
4682919 that was about to reveal that dave hawk had stolen in excess of 300 000
4682920 he told me these events arent going to stop until she was dead
4682921 i believe it was his intention to have her missing without any evidence where she went missing from
4682922 and to have her car found in the possession of criminals in the fresno area and therefore he would not be a suspect
4682923 had to use alternative means to secure her which led to blood being deposited in the house

4682928 we get to see a different airframe a larger plane with different capabilities
4682929 when we made the arrangement for them to come here it was purely training based
4682930 but when you see the planes on the ramp and you know that in two years those planes will be moving you start to think about them moving here
4682931 that airplane is a better fit in the long term for our mission here

4682935 its a real unique opportunity to fly against different pilots as well
4682936 the planes are important but it really comes down to how well trained the pilots are some of our younger pilots are probably going to get their butts kicked the first few times up

4682961 ich empfehle der berliner cdu sich nicht von morgens bis abends mit kandidatenlisten f r die bundestags und die europawahl zu besch ftigen sie muss jetzt geschlossenheit zeigen und sich inhaltlich zu fragen wie dem ffentlichen dienst den wirtschaftsproblemen und der tats chlichen etatlage klar positionieren

4683079 as far as dealing with the past is concerned duyvendak could learn a few things from former german foreign minister joschka fischer fischer was also an activist and a dangerous one too but he never ran away from his past on the contrary he fully admitted his involvement and in doing so held himself up as a painful example to a new generation of how and why someone can take the wrong path a nation can learn from such an admission and it is plausible for such a politician to stay in office even though breaking the law is naturally taboo in such a position duyvendak on the other hand tried to conceal his indirect participation in violent acts that do not even deserve to be called civil disobedience because they were done anonymously

4683107 this body has little to do with bigfoot and everything to do with a sasquatch costume that someone developed after watching too many gorilla movies

4683210 estoy m s que feliz pero los detalles sobre el embarazo tendr que darlos gael
4683211 me siento muy orgullosa por su paternidad es parte del crecimiento aunque en alg n momento la noticia me sorprendi pues no daba cr dito de que mi peque o entrar en una nueva etapa en la cual espero le vaya bien
4683212 l est feliz por el acontecimiento y creo que atraviesa por un buen momento en su vida
4683213 es una mujer extraordinaria pero debo decir que la conozco poco y bueno si gael est feliz yo tambi n lo estoy porque al final es lo que importa que ellos est n bien
4683214 gael seguir siendo ciudadano del mundo por lo que no sabemos donde establecer n su domicilio e incluso no s donde nacer el beb
4683215 dolores esta bien creo que el beb tiene casi tres meses y a n no he preguntado sobre su sexo
4683216 espero s lo disfrutarlo por que la noticia nos ha llenado de felicidad
4683217 siempre hemos sido una familia que sostiene una buena comunicaci n
4683218 para gael este es el comienzo de una serie de proyectos que realizar en su vida personal y profesional
4683219 gael tiene 29 a os de edad as que ya no es un peque o y si l decidi ser padre es bueno y yo no tengo nada que decir m s que apoyarlo
4683220 l emilio me manifest que ir a hasta las ltimas consecuencias es una cosa que celebro y que verdaderamente se la tom muy bien el haber tenido el valor c vico de presentar la controversia
4683221 esta situaci n es altamente ben fica para los jaliscienses me parece que el gobernador est haciendo lo adecuado no es posible que en jalisco paguemos tres veces y medio m s por una supuesta democracia de la que pagan en nuevo le n los partidos pol ticos son un coto de poder
4683222 hay que hacerle un llamado a la clase pol tica y sobre todo al legislativo a que entienda que tiene una responsabilidad ante electores no para cuidar los intereses de partidos
4683223 para qu nos desgastamos tanto hacemos un llamado a los diputados a que dialoguemos qu reforma electoral queremos pedimos que mesas de di logo en la que podamos participar todos y definir cu l es el rumbo democr tico que queremos para el estado
4683224 creemos que no hay mayor problema para que la controversia no sea procedente
4683225 una muestra de la divisi n entre dos facciones panistas se trata del uso de una facultad legal
4683226 lo que nosotros opinamos es que respetamos y reconocemos que el gobernador est en derecho de ejercer esa atribuci n pero esperamos conocer el documento para ver en qu t rminos presenta la controversia aunque por sus declaraciones vemos que el fondo es el financiamiento a los partidos pol ticos
4683227 en el distrito federal son 34 pesos y en el estado de m xico 55 pesos por a o la reforma pretende que en jalisco se entreguen anualmente 33 pesos por ciudadano registrado
4683228 hay que acudir al art culo 105 de la constituci n del pa s
4683229 donde se determina claramente que no puede haber controversia en materia electoral por el contrario est abierta la v a para una acci n de inconstitucionalidad pero sta tambi n est fuera del alcance del titular del gobierno porque s lo procede si se acciona por parte de una tercera parte del congreso del estado por parte del procurador general de la rep blica o bien por parte del dirigente nacional de un partido pol tico
4683230 tampoco es posible modificar para aumentar o disminuir el monto de financiamiento a los partidos porque eso ser a inconstitucional la f rmula y el porcentaje quedaron definidos en el art culo sexto transitorio de las reformas que se aprobaron en la c mara de diputados y la c mara de senadores
4683231 de la falta de entendimiento de los grupos que ejercen el poder en jalisco en el mismo pan no se est n entendiendo estos dos grupos y esto la controversia es un reflejo de lo que pasa
4683232 porque se complica demasiado el ambiente est n muy cercanas las elecciones y sin duda esto puede traer un escenario de choque muy fuerte y complicar m s las cosas adem s estar entrando en poco tiempo la discusi n del presupuesto estatal para 2009 y ser pesado elaborarlo en estas condiciones

4683274 queensland has looked overseas for innovations that will help us improve health care delivery in the face of a worldwide shortage of doctors
4683275 physicians assistants will extend the capacity of our highly skilled medical workforce
4683276 we need to provide the best possible training for junior doctors and for doctors to gain experience they must have opportunities to see patients and do procedures
4683277 we are concerned if physician assistants are increasingly used they could be substituted for doctors in some of these roles and the training of junior medicos compromised
4683278 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4683279 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there
4683280 the damage that has been done to peoples mental and physical health by detaining them in remote high security detention centres such as this has been documented repeatedly
4683281 great white fear of the dark phallus big black barack
4683282 paul enjoins a man examine himself before eating of this bread or drinking from this cup i cor 11 28 by this as i interpret it he meant that each man descend into himself and ponder with himself whether he rests with inward assurance of heart upon the salvation purchased by christ whether he acknowledges it by confession of mouth then whether he aspires to the imitation of christ with the zeal of innocence and holiness whether after christs example he is prepared to give himself for his brethren and to communicate himself to those with whom he shares christ in common whether as he is counted a member by christ he in turn so holds all his brethren as members of his body whether he desires to cherish protect and help them as his own members not that these duties both of faith and of love can now be made perfect in us but that we should endeavor and aspire with all our heart toward this end in order that we may day by day increase our faith once begun
4683283 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
4683284 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
4683285 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
4683286 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
4683287 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
4683288 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
4683289 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
4683290 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
4683291 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
4683292 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
4683293 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
4683294 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
4683295 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
4683296 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
4683297 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
4683298 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
4683299 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
4683300 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
4683301 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
4683302 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
4683303 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
4683304 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
4683305 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
4683306 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
4683307 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
4683308 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
4683309 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
4683310 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
4683311 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
4683312 this is a planning took where all things are going
4683313 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
4683314 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
4683315 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
4683316 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
4683317 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
4683318 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
4683319 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
4683320 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
4683321 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
4683322 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
4683323 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
4683324 civilized areas in order to eat and gain the weight they need to hibernate now many are beng shot because they look for food where they once lived this is not right on any level
4683325 stop slaughter of bear looking for food in the urban areas
4683326 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
4683327 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
4683328 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
4683329 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
4683330 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
4683331 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
4683332 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
4683333 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
4683334 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
4683335 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
4683336 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
4683337 this is just for the culverts which is phase one of the southwest cut project and it will be paid for by the ciap grant
4683338 there has never really been anything proven that this will be good for the bay
4683339 east matagorda bay is a unique bay its a small bay system its not like galveston or any other of the larger bays
4683340 my concern is the salinity that will come in through the colorado river into that east matagorda bay
4683341 we have no idea what its going to do to the sea grasses the fish the shrimp and everything else
4683342 im really concerned not just me but the whole community because weve been known to do things that effect systems in our environment negatively and a lot of times you cant backtrack and fix them
4683343 this culvert as it stands right now will be monitored if it is detrimental to the bay it will be simple to close it in and reverse it
4683344 this is not something that is irreversible in fact the last thing that i would want to do or anyone would want to do would be to do something that would be harmful for east matagorda bay
4683345 this will help keep the mouth of the river open itll be good for drainage and i think it will be good for marine life
4683346 judge i can tell you that there are a lot of people upset at the live oak landing subdivision because they were told that they would be able to build up to the creek and they cant
4683347 ive had several calls and a contractor that came in and was supposed to have built a bunch of gazebos and decks and they cant do it because it is on the flood plain
4683348 so i dont know how far they are going to take it but its a serious problem i mean its out of our control but its happening
4683349 i just hate to see these people come in and get sold a bill of goods before anything has even been done to support it
4683350 that is just deceptive trade practices and we just need to encourage people to be diligent before they buy something
4683351 all we can do is really encourage people to use a realtor who is legally obligated to disclose the conditions of the property because i dont know how you regulate honesty
4683352 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
4683353 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
4683354 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
4683355 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
4683356 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
4683357 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
4683358 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
4683359 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas
4683360 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
4683361 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
4683362 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
4683363 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
4683364 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
4683365 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
4683366 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
4683367 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
4683368 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
4683369 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
4683370 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
4683371 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
4683372 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
4683373 in cold years the gas company earns money and in the warmer years you lose money
4683374 the board has tried to keep gas prices to the bone as much as possible
4683375 six or seven years ago we had the money to back the funding for the next year
4683376 its easy to look at last years budget and see what should have been done the hard part is not the amendment process but the upcoming budget
4683377 i get the excuse always that there is a broken truck
4683378 because we live on the coast the red cross had us on standby so we didnt know when they were going to call us out
4683379 just when we got back home decided it was too late for them to call us out is when we got the call that we were supposed to leave
4683380 three days after the fact there is still terrible flooding many of the roads that we need to take to get to some shelters are still impassable and i heard that about 200 000 people down here are still without power or bathroom facilities
4683381 there are lots of roofs blown off houses trees are blown over and downed power lines
4683382 we just have to expect the unexpected and go where we are needed
4683383 ive been on the phone trying to get more supplies sent down here to the shelter in santa rosa
4683384 ive never seen a community do what bay city has done in the past 10 years
4683385 you have value on the ground more than you spent
4683386 under the texas local government code the city has the right to approve the professionals it hires
4683387 the attorney general ruled that a contractor is a professional
4683388 lindsay was laughing and giggling with a group of guys at the delano hotels florida room
4683389 lindsay is the aggressive one in the relationship sam tries to focus on lindsay but its never enough
4683390 lindsay has to be the center of attention or shell flirt with other guys to make sam jealous
4683391 god tells us to love each other and love doesnt discriminate
4683392 with the signing of this accord all russian troops and any paramilitary and irregular troops that entered with them must leave immediately
4683393 the verbal assurance that president dmitry medvedev gave that russian military operations had stopped clearly was not honoured
4683394 yes ideally we would like a vote formalising the ceasefire this weekend
4683395 but well take as long as it takes we are not going to push for a vote if we know that the russians will veto the text which does not mean we have to give in to all their demands there has to be hard bargaining
4683396 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4683397 moscow must honour its commitment to withdraw its invading forces from all georgian territory
4683398 a significant part of georgian territory remains under foreign military occupation
4683399 never ever will georgia reconcile itself with the occupation of even one square kilometre of its territory
4683400 unfortunately the losses have been consistent throughout the five years and we came to the conclusion that we couldnt continue producing the paper
4683401 it was a surprise and many of us cried i was here since day one and i can honestly tell you that we are a big family and we know we are doing a good job serving the community
4683402 during these past five years we were the main source of news for the hispanic community
4683403 we are sad to say goodbye but satisfied because we fulfilled our mission
4683404 el nuevo dia orlando emphasized what was relevant news for the hispanic community losing it means that we lose a spokesperson for our issues we lose an ally in the hispanic cause
4683405 russian aggression must not go unanswered and that its continuation would have serious consequences for its relations with the united states

4683413 no one is going to follow orders when theyre being demeaned like that
4683414 as an organization we take it quite seriously weve spent a lot of time looking into it
4683415 i feel that its possible that the fans at the time were inebriated
4683416 when people are drunk things can get out of hand and things can get crazy
4683417 if there was any evidence of discrimination and racism the employee would be fired
4683418 a lot of people are sickened by sector latinos treatment
4683419 a lot of people are upset about it its not a happy situation
4683420 the stadium shouldnt do anything because these fans were drunk
4683421 my view is that the russians and i would say principally prime minister putin are interested in reasserting russias not only great power or superpower status but in reasserting russias traditional spheres of influence
4683422 my guess is that everyone is going to be looking at russia through a different set of lenses as we look ahead
4683423 anymore is an interesting add i have never believed that one should make national policy on the basis of trust i think you make national security based on interests and realities
4683424 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4683425 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4683426 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4683427 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4683428 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4683429 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4683430 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4683431 presidential campaign advertising should come at the end of august and then i think its going to come fast and furious
4683432 a significant amount of our resources will go to those four states
4683433 the vision for searchii came from a lack of relevant search options in new zealand searching for local search results became a task of filtering out the rubbish and ending up lost or using offline methods

4683443 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california
4683444 its the same sentence as in 2000 only marriage between a man and a woman is valid or recognized in california yet the issue that will be put before voters nov 4 is radically different this time the wording would be used to rescind an existing constitutional right to marry we fervently hope that voters whatever their personal or religious convictions will shudder at such a step and vote no on proposition 8
4683445 the state of same sex marriage shifted in may when the california supreme court overturned proposition 22 the ban on gay marriage that voters approved eight years ago and ruled that marriage was a fundamental right under the state constitution
4683446 what voters must consider about proposition 8 is that unlike proposition 22 this is no longer about refining existing california law in the wake of the courts ruling the only way to deny marriage to gay and lesbian couples is by revising constitutional rights themselves proposition 8 seeks to embed wording in the constitution that would eliminate the fundamental right to same sex marriage
4683447 our increasing tendency to speak of what is most important to us in terms of rights and to frame nearly every social controversy as a clash of rights
4683448 the most distinctive features of our american rights dialect are the very ones that are most conspicuously in tension with what we require in order to give a reasonably full and coherent account of what kind of society we are and what kind of polity we are trying to create its penchant for absolute extravagant formulations its near aphasia concerning responsibility its excessive homage to individual independence and self sufficiency its habitual concentration on the individual and the state at the expense of the intermediate groups of civil society and its unapologetic insularity not only does each of these traits make it difficult to give voice to common sense or moral intuitions they also impede development of the sort of rational political discourse that is appropriate to the needs of a mature complex liberal pluralistic development

4683462 dont ever talk badly about their dad allow them to talk well of him
4683463 how the biological mom and dad navigate life for the entire future of their childs life
4683464 is the most critical part of the child having an opportunity to thrive versus just surviving or continuing in the brokenness and woundedness resulting from their parents divorce
4683465 most children of divorce do struggle with loving mom and loving dad and being able to express that in their everyday life
4683466 a lot of times kids act like theyre not listening but theyre hearing everything you say
4683467 intentionally find things in the other parent that you can say are positive point them out to the child give the child permission to love the other parent
4683468 forgiveness gives parents the ability to co parent without all the emotional drama without rehashing the past without hatred
4683469 i didnt want to spend the next 20 years of my life looking back pointing blame asking unanswerable questions
4683470 forgiveness becomes a gift to the parent to their children and to every other relationship in their life
4683471 why take so much energy grocery listing what he did wrong
4683472 just transact the business which is the business of supporting a child
4683473 to get sidelined into personal or marital issues and keep the conversation always and only on the children

4683567 we showed some footage we just got out enthused it was a fraction of a second or one or two steps
4683568 they new zealand were just a little bit more desperate

4683571 it was just a matter of showing them a few clips here and there and making sure the guys understood where they needed to improve and what they needed to do
4683572 things like working hard off the ball and trying to be balanced going into the breakdown and keeping our head up and making sure we maintain or take that space
4683573 they south africa are probably technically not the same as new zealand going into the breakdown but they use a lot of power
4683574 weve got to make sure that we are there in numbers and working as hard as we can to make sure we secure the ball or try and turn it over like we did against them in perth
4683575 we were very good at getting numbers there and competing consistently and we turned over a few balls
4683576 i was expecting he would go for a world record time but it is a real honor to be swimming with michael phelps

4683585 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4683586 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4683587 i would say ive got some new strengths on the interior line
4683588 it could have been kind of predictable last year but hopefully ill get some change ups and weve got some new guys inside that we could definitely do more things with theres more possibilities
4683589 ive been working on a couple of different things and trying out some things some of it ill keep some of it ill probably throw away hopefully once we get into a game and i use them well see how it works

4683603 if he had chosen to land at an airport we would not be here today
4683604 the fact that you argue that they may not be able to prove their charges does not warrant their dismissal
4683605 no one gives directions like turn right here go left there everyone knows where to go from the chick n dip
4683606 people like being able to come to a place like this because there arent many around

4683714 if the first woman god ever made was strong enough to turn the world upside down all alone these women together ought to be able to turn it back and get it right side up again
4683715 we hold these truths to be self evident that all men and women are created equal that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights that among these are life liberty and the pursuit of happiness that to secure these rights governments are instituted deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed whenever any form of government becomes destructive of these ends it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it and to insist upon the institution of a new government but when a long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing invariably the same object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security such has been the patient sufferance of the women under this government and such is now the necessity which constrains them to demand the equal station to which they are entitled
4683716 it is the right of those who suffer from it to refuse allegiance to it
4683717 it is their duty to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security

4683725 se ajustan a lo que marca la ley en espa a por el concepto gastos de gesti n al ofrecer la informaci n de todas las ofertas del mercado

4683772 its certainly not a journey that i expected or planned but it has become an imperative journey
4683773 what the american people thought they were getting was leadership in opposition to the policies of the bush administration but thats not what they got at all the u s voter got betrayed
4683774 the democratic leadership became complicit with the republican leadership in war crimes in crimes against humanity in torture in crimes against the peace
4683775 it is clear that emanating from washington d c is something alien to the values of the u s people therefore i have decided to do something that i have never done before in order to have something i have never had before and that is public policy made with green values
4683776 i point out to them that its the two major parties that spoil it for the american people the american people should have more of a choice than just two major parties that tend towards eachother in order to get the maximum amount of votes and once they get in office they do things for special interests that support them regardless of what the american people want
4683777 going up to people and saying would you like to help these great candidates onto the ballot they dont have to vote for them they dont have to be a green they just have to support political choice

4683787 we feel that in the documents presented last night both in moscow and in tbilisi the principal element the respect of the territorial integrity of georgia is missing
4683788 full support for the territorial integrity of georgia within internationally recognised borders
4683789 the only option to prevent similar acts of aggression and occupation against georgia in the future is to give them a nato membership action plan
4683790 those countries who value freedom and democracy must stand up for it whenever it is threatened and i see that as a special mission for all those of us who have suffered under totalitarian domination
4683791 an immediate ceasefire the end of aggression and of the further occupation of sovereign democratic georgia
4683792 if you love wealth more than liberty the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom depart from us in peace we ask not your counsel nor your arms crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you may your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen

4683818 i have to conserve as much physical and emotional energy as i can
4683819 but i think theres going to be a lot of time for me to rest over the next 18 hours or so and ill be able to be ready for tomorrow mornings 100
4683820 tomorrow is going to be a tough race for me to be a player in that race i have to be closer at the 50 if im not then it will be tough i was over a body length behind at the 50 in the prelims and came up a bit short so i have to be there
4683821 anybody can say whatever they want but i know im clean
4683822 people can question it all they want but the facts are the facts i have the results to prove it
4683823 i touched the wall and was like thank you finally
4683824 you can start by not worrying about what everybody else thinks
4683825 nobody knows what ive really gone through in the last eight years and what has gotten me to this point besides myself and a few people that i know well so its my own personal deal at this point
4683826 thats the theme of the meet you have to break a world record to win i gave it my all and i had nothing left
4683827 im very proud of what ive done ryan swam well he earned it

4683831 im very proud of how ive handled the heavier workload
4683832 i can help raise him money and if he wants my pretty face standing by his side at one of these rallies id be glad to show up
4683833 the only way for mccain and the republican party to play catch up is to raise for the rnc and use president bush as the attraction
4683834 i think hes a bigger fundraising draw than mccain among the republican hard core
4683835 for the candidates there are pluses that bush brings and difficulties
4683836 the plus is that he can raise money the difficulty is that he brings his job approval with him and people are going to have to figure out how to effectively balance that out as they look at their own situation
4683837 but i think if his current popularity ratings continue to be low its going to be tough to find people who are really eager to go to him for help
4683838 until somebody else emerges as the party leader the former guy is going to be a big draw

4683856 cloning isnt here now but with this new technique we have the technology that can actually produce a child if this was applied to humans it would be enormously important and troublesome
4683857 at this point there are no laws or regulations for this kind of thing and the bizarre thing is that the catholic church and other traditional stem cell opponents think this technology is great when in reality it could in the end become one of their biggest nightmares
4683858 it is quite possible that the real legacy of this whole new programming technology is that it will be introducing the era of designer babies
4683859 so for instance if we had a few skin cells from albert einstein or anyone else in the world you could have a child that is say 10 per cent or 70 per cent albert einstein by just injecting a few of their cells into an embryo

4683870 there are a lot of background talks going on whereby a way is trying to be found so that there is no impeachment
4683871 a crime scene was set up and inquiries are continuing
4683872 this may be normal for most people but for me its a most unusual day
4683873 lo hermoso de actuar es que uno puede vivir la vida de otros sin tener que pagar el precio por ello
4683874 mi lema es si el film funciona si mi personaje encaja entoces todo est en orden
4683875 household electricity bills could also be trimmed by 20 to 95 a year for each pc depending on local power costs and the kind of pcs in use
4683876 we all have memories of a special holiday or christmas the little girl in my painting will always remember this christmas and her favorite gift the holidays are a wonderful time of the year i love the sounds and the smells and the expressions on peoples faces everyone celebrates the holidays in their own way and in their own faith its a time for love and forgiveness a time to reflect and a time to be with the ones we love
4683877 this was a great way to reach these household decision makers
4683878 it was an opportunity to speak to them directly with a different voice as well as see their point of view in a new way
4683879 its a three way focus group without the one way mirror
4683880 the draw is that food net is saying to its viewers we want you to watch this and we care what you have to say
4683881 adding newsday media groups superb assets to cablevisions portfolio presents a multitude of opportunities to provide consumers with additional quality content on multiple platforms expand advertising opportunities for both entities and attract a larger audience than either company could on its own
4683882 i dont know the man but i grew up watching him on tv
4683883 a lookout should be built in green colorbond steel a lookout in the same style as the magnificent grand canyon lookout
4683884 this will not require any tree removal and allow tourists of all ages to safely enjoy the spectacular lookout of the scenic rim
4683885 the lamington plateau remains one of australias seven most superb natural wonders
4683886 there is some urgent need for lateral thinking with the lookout sites
4683887 if it could be done at a reasonable cost out of glass then all the better otherwise green colorbond to match the landscape
4683888 its an interesting idea and well certainly have a look at what mr fischer is proposing
4683889 kalbar akan mengajukan anggaran pendidikan di atas 20 persen artinya kita bertekad akan mengalokasikan anggaran pendidikan di kalimantan barat di atas 20 persen
4683890 faktor apa saja yang membuat hal itu belum bisa terealisasi apakah karena keuangan kita yang tidak cukup atau ada program prioritas yang memang harus didahulukan dan sebagainya tapi yang jelas penganggaran kita pada tahun apbd 2009 mendatang sudah di atas 20 persen
4683891 apapun alasannya pemerintah provinsi kalimantan barat juga harus mematuhi aturan itu
4683892 kita mengimbau agar pihak eksekutif dapat memformulasikan anggaran pendidikan sebesar 20 persen dalam apbd 2009 mendatang
4683893 ini merupakan konsekwensi logis apakah kita mau melanggar undang undang dasar 1945 atau kita mau melakukan pengecualian kecuali ada kebijakan lain dari pemerintah pusat namun sampai hari belum ada pengecualian kebijakan khusus dari pemerintah pusat untuk mengatur penundaan alokasi anggaran pendidikan sebesar 20 persen tersebut
4683894 kalau 20 persen dari total apbd tentu akan sangat mengganggu posisi anggaran dan berisiko mengurangi terhadap sektor sektor anggaran di bidang lainnya
4683895 it is an extremely harsh and stark environment to detain people seeking asylum while their applications for protection are determined
4683896 the very expensive security systems of the facility are quite unnecessary for the population who may be detained there
4683897 the damage that has been done to peoples mental and physical health by detaining them in remote high security detention centres such as this has been documented repeatedly
4683898 the rudd government inherited the new immigration detention centre on christmas island which was designed and built to the previous governments specifications as a maximum security facility
4683899 we showed some footage we just got out enthused it was a fraction of a second or one or two steps
4683900 they new zealand were just a little bit more desperate
4683901 the talk is always about being physical but not so much about the action its just a mindset its an attitude and a bit of technique that we need to work on
4683902 i just pointed out that our attitude and being technically very good at the breakdown will get us through there and being physical is just a by product of that
4683903 it was just a matter of showing them a few clips here and there and making sure the guys understood where they needed to improve and what they needed to do
4683904 things like working hard off the ball and trying to be balanced going into the breakdown and keeping our head up and making sure we maintain or take that space
4683905 they south africa are probably technically not the same as new zealand going into the breakdown but they use a lot of power
4683906 weve got to make sure that we are there in numbers and working as hard as we can to make sure we secure the ball or try and turn it over like we did against them in perth
4683907 we were very good at getting numbers there and competing consistently and we turned over a few balls
4683908 pupuk subsidi ini ada tiga jenis yaitu pupuk urea pupuk sp 36 dan pupuk npk punska
4683909 dan juklak 03 ini adalah dasar pijakan menyatukan persepsi tersebut
4683910 kalau itu yang dipakai beda satu suara pun dia yang duduk
4683911 itu telepon dari daerah mereka menanyakan sudah ada belum fax revisi juklak soal suara terbanyak itu
4683912 selama ini kita cukup stress dengan penempatan nomor urut sebab itu dari pemilu ke pemilu selalu jadi rebutan
4683913 nomor urut itu tinggal gengsi saja sekarang tapi kalau tidak terpilih malunya besar
4683914 yah sekarang berusahalah memperkenalkan diri dengan masyarakat agar dipilih pada pemilu nanti disini figur sangat menentukan
4683915 penilaian ini merupakan penilaian apbd pada tahun 2007 yang lalu dan kala itu kami masih belum menjabat kami dilantik pada tanggal 14 januari 2008 oleh karena itu tentu kami membutuhkan waktu untuk melihat itu melihat kenapa kita sampai bisa mendapatkan penilaian yang tentu tidak menggembirakan tersebut
4683916 tentunya jajaran kita mulai dari sekda sampai keseluruhan akan segera menindaklanjuti hal ini sesegera mungkin
4683917 tadinya kita berharap terjadi peningkatan dari tahun ke tahun tetapi kali ini betul betul kembali lagi ke titik nol dengan tidak memberikan pendapat artinya masih banyak hal yang perlu diperbaiki oleh pemerintah provinsi khususnya yang menyangkut sistem akuntansi pemerintahan
4683918 peran serta dprd dalam mendorong pelaksanaan tindak lanjut hasil pemeriksaan bpk ri sangat kami harapkan karena efektivitas pemeriksaan terutama terletak pada dilaksanakannya tindak lanjut sesuai dengan saran atau rekomendasi
4683919 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4683920 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4683921 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4683922 latihan ini dimaksudkan meningkatkan profesionalisme polisi dalam memberikan pengamanan selama proses pilkada berlangsung
4683923 the spanish have their own brand of humor just as we cubans have our own brand of humor that is not meant to offend but those unfamiliar with our culture might construe as offensive
4683924 ooh gooddy send me gt to the twilight zone again
4683925 carla al m do que voc comentou t o bem outras coisas me chamaram aten o nesse filmes primeiro s o est rias bem contadas sobre a morte prematura e acidental de pessoas que realmente existiram um tema importante e chocante pra materialistas como eu mas muito comum e repetitivo no cinema ent o vou pular essa parte homem urso
4683926 o homem urso s de imaginar algu m ser dilacerado vivo por um urso enorme ficamos aterrorizados
4683927 the point is to repeat the lie and thus give it new life
4683928 pushed by conservative book clubs that buy in bulk to drive up sales
4683929 its clear kilpatrick knew who detective white was he had previous contact with him through his other case he specifically called him by name in this case
4683930 you should be ashamed of yourself being with a man with the last name white you should not be a part of this
4683931 change the header to assault on a police officer and fondling
4683932 this was very stressful to me personally i was under a lot of stress my way of alleviating stress is to make light of things
4683933 i dont think well see the best from crews in our race until the last 500m in the final and we are very wary of that
4683934 nous estimons que la premi re femme est tomb e malade et qualors plusieurs membres de sa famille se sont occup s delle restant dans la m me pi ce quelle
4683935 jusqu pr sent nous navions pas vraiment dempreinte digitale pour confirmer une transmission entre humains comme nous lavons eu ici

4683937 nous navons pas constat d volution dans la mutation du virus qui changerait la transmissibilit du virus il y a une l g re mutation mais tous les virus grippaux mutent sans cesse
4683938 nous estimons que la premi re femme est tomb e malade et qualors plusieurs membres de sa famille se sont occup s delle restant dans la m me pi ce quelle

4683941 nous navons pas constat d volution dans la mutation du virus qui changerait la transmissibilit du virus il y a une l g re mutation mais tous les virus grippaux mutent sans cesse
4683942 now just imagine the relationship of the african american community with the democratic party and this song
4683943 we have a community that is engaged in a relationship where they know
4683944 they know but they dont want to be lonely they dont want to be left out on a limb all by themselves and so its easier to find comfort in something that even abuses you than to step out on your own and bear the consequences of being alone
4683945 so what i have done is ive said no longer i am going to be involved in a dysfunctional one sided relationship
4683946 its good to have good staff around it makes it nice and easy
4683947 to be honest i thought before the race that he might have needed this run i still thought he looked a little pretty but he hung on very well
4683948 before today i thought that he was a sprinter type
4683949 half way down the straight i thought he was going to fold but he really stuck his head out and got to the line good
4683950 i had him in the weanling sale but we werent going to give him away
4683951 and then after he won at moonee valley on debut we had an offer of 400 000 for him from hong kong
4683952 but a vet came out and looked at his legs and said he wasnt even worth x raying
4683953 for the past six months of so weve always had saranda on top
4683954 es gibt auch keine zweifel an der richtigkeit der zeitmessung
4683955 vor meinem letzten zug habe ich gedacht dass ich das rennen verloren habe und es vorbei ist
4683956 aber es war die richtige entscheidung mit einem kleinen schnellen schwung anzuschlagen wenn ich geglitten w re dann w re ich wohl zu sp t gekommen
4683957 vor meinem letzten zug habe ich gedacht dass ich das rennen verloren habe und es vorbei ist
4683958 many will die at adlai e stevenson high school on 10 31
4683959 the only real person that wouldnt judge me talk back be angry or mistreat me was the computer
4683960 to me the internet was a place where i could vent cry and swear without anyone judging me
4683961 people have to understand what is going on in this country since columbine and other scenes where armed people have descended on schools
4683962 imagine how those parents felt that day who did not know if their children were safe
4683963 parents whose hearts must have been in their throats thinking they had kissed their children goodbye that morning and now might never see them again
4683964 he may have made a bad choice but as parents we all do stupid things
4683965 this was a pre planned event that endangered his child
4683966 if he had chosen to land at an airport we would not be here today
4683967 the fact that you argue that they may not be able to prove their charges does not warrant their dismissal
4683968 oh war das knapp mir sind mehrere steine vom herzen gefallen ich war am herzkasper
4683969 with the beginning of the school year just weeks away it is important that we do all we can to ensure that our schools are as safe as possible for students and teachers alike
4683970 it is indeed unfortunate any time violence enters the school if teachers and students fear for their own personal safety while at school our entire educational system suffers
4683971 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4683972 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them
4683973 now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we do not see
4683974 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4683975 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4683976 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4683977 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4683978 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4683979 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4683980 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4683981 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4683982 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4683983 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4683984 we get by with a little help from our friends
4683985 first and foremost carl taught me to work hard every day and never take anything for granted
4683986 it has been said that all glory is fleeting it is not about the glory it is about working hard for those you are here to serve
4683987 we just knew all along that dave was going to be the choice but there was a mourning period and we had to wait to move on it took every bit of this time
4683988 but i am also sad about the way in which it happened from my viewpoint i will continue the many fine things carl started here and i will work even harder to make huntley a better place to live
4683989 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4683990 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4683991 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4683992 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark
4683993 7f88f2da9a2b54eedc5f62bad9c17058 o seu claro vai ser bem diferente e coloque no campo
4683994 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4683995 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4683996 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4683997 obviously more of this water will be traversable in more parts of the year so we want to find it before hollywood
4683998 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4683999 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4684000 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4684001 its very exciting its like an indiana jones adventure its searching for a lost under water tomb
4684002 our objective is to find and protect the wreck because they are in danger of being found by people who dont have the know how and the same intention and preoccupation that we have
4684003 for the first time in over 160 years i feel that the witnesses of the franklin tragedy events have a chance to really contribute to an important search party
4684004 our goal in south asia is to seek a peaceful stable and prosperous neighbourhood
4684005 we wish all our neighbours well we welcome the strengthening of democratic forces in our neighbourhood especially in bhutan nepal and pakistan
4684006 and to bring a lasting and honourable peace in our region
4684007 if this issue of terrorism is not addressed all the good intentions that we have for our two peoples to live in peace and harmony will be negated we will not be able to pursue the peace initiatives we want to take the terrorists and those who support them are enemies of the people of india and pakistan of friendship between the two countries and of peace in the region and the world we must defeat them
4684008 whatever resources are required will be provided whatever manpower is required will be provided we are firm in our resolve to meet the challenge of terrorism
4684009 the challenge of communalism of extremism and of terrorism cannot be won by a nation divided
4684010 in this hour of crisis divisive politics will lead us nowhere i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state
4684011 they accepted the decision of the referee and i think the issue is very clear
4684012 the most devastating loss you can have at the olympics
4684013 if it was up to me i would just drop the protest
4684014 im stoked with what happened im very very happy i dont want to fight this it is a gold medal at stake its a difficult thing to lose but you have to understand i came into this competition with the goal to win a bronze medal i went my best time and did better than bronze i got silver and almost got gold
4684015 i guess my two finishes over the last four years have been pretty good
4684016 that he can win by huge margins and when theyre really close races hes got the drive to keep going and he just doesnt get that tired
4684017 i think what makes it special is hes so good in this environment
4684018 a treatment is a conscious movement of thought there is no hocus pocus in mental treatment it is definite conscious concrete and explicit
4684019 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4684020 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4684021 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4684022 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4684023 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4684024 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4684025 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4684026 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4684027 h ra grannar med kompletta ans kningshandlingar och dessutom med tydligt angivande av sk len till varf r grannarna h rs de kan ju inte s ga n got om en ans kt avvikelse fr n en plan om de inte f r veta vilka planbest mmelser som g ller och vilka planavvikelser som r aktuella en detaljplans best mmelser ska inte undanh llas vare sig s kande eller ber rda grannar
4684028 at this rate reconstruction will last 10 years and a generation of our citizens of our children will be raised in inequality because they live in huts and have nowhere to study
4684029 i would say that hes not completely out of the picture still
4684030 hes a fugitive and hes probably seeking refugee status and the thai attorney general would have to prove hes not a refugee and he doesnt deserve to have refugee status and that will be a legal process that will become a political issue in the near future
4684031 well indeed escape to england this time has turned thaksin into a political martyr which will serve to maintain the strength of his party
4684032 my guess is that the samak government will survive for quite a long time much longer than many people suspect
4684033 the big question is not what pervez musharraf is going to do but whats going to happen to him next
4684034 i dont think he can be given safe passage anywhere except to jail if you think about it it would be a problem for any country to take him in because al qaeda has said that he will be unsafe wherever he goes
4684035 look i find it surprising that any footage that could help to solve these crimes has not been made public and i find it really staggering that it would only be released to one media outlet
4684036 the claremont murders were just one of the great tragedies of western australia
4684037 i live in claremont its my electorate i know the families i know the effect on them and i know the effect on the surrounding community
4684038 the art of going within how to meditate or escape from stress
4684039 they say dont touch my motherland dont you want to see china strong
4684040 they see criticism of the regime as criticism of the people
4684041 the olympics by itself is an embodiment of a sort of chinese coming out party
4684042 the chinese are looking at the olympic games as the kind of washing off of all humiliation and bad things that china used to represent
4684043 chinese canadians still hold dear the fact that they are chinese when china becomes a super nation they feel proud they feel that their status in society is tied directly to how china is being thought of on the world stage
4684044 these are rare occasions the chinese communities come together to identify
4684045 theyre rarely expressing anything it takes quite extreme situations k for so many of diverse chinese backgrounds to say together coverage was bad it was wrong
4684046 it started as frustration and dissatisfaction about perceived bias in the reporting on tibet
4684047 many people felt that the reporting was overly negative sensationalistic and distorted this translates into the feeling that there is a prejudice against china and chinese in general
4684048 in the community there is that sense of finally we can show the world what we can do
4684049 as a first generation immigrant it is really about trying to remove the inferiority complex that has been etched into our souls
4684050 teachers especially in primary school and high school imposed on every student that k the chinese have a potential theyve never been able to realize the chinese are incapable
4684051 the fact that china did not stumble did not make a mess of the olympics is gratification
4684052 that achievement has been given very little merit the canadian population has developed this chinese phobia that china is a dictatorship that can do nothing right
4684053 china has been making efforts to open itself to the whole world weve come to a time where the rest of the world should improve their understanding about china its political situation its culture its history
4684054 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4684055 the thing thats always impressed me the most is the way they play the game
4684056 he is a guy i have admired for a long time his playing style and his production he has been a great player with different organizations and with nine pro bowls
4684057 im kind of nervous the reason why being what we did last year as a whole unit
4684058 were going to try and come out and put points on the board because thats what the coaches ask us to do the expectations the bars set so high here not by you all and not by the fans but the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year man i dont think we can really live and dwell off that
4684059 i thought denver would be my last stop but things happened and here i am
4684060 the thing thats always impressed me the most is the way they play the game
4684061 he is a guy i have admired for a long time his playing style and his production he has been a great player with different organizations and with nine pro bowls
4684062 im kind of nervous the reason why being what we did last year as a whole unit
4684063 were going to try and come out and put points on the board because thats what the coaches ask us to do the expectations the bars set so high here not by you all and not by the fans but the coaches and the team we have high expectations for this offense and this team as a unit but what we did last year man i dont think we can really live and dwell off that
4684064 tiene su primera etapa cuando incursiona en el estudio del
4684065 i was in my happy place like i am in my really hard tempo runs
4684066 my coach just told me to zone out i had no idea what place was what at the finish
4684067 she just won the bronze medal i just want to see her
4684068 this is what she trained for this is what i gave up my job for
4684069 because she had the best time in the world this year i knew that if anybodys there with the leaders its shalane
4684070 athletes are such type a personalities this took her mind off the race
4684071 i hate the word fluke and since last year with my bronze medal my name has been associated with it
4684072 but shalane showed that the strength of u s running is no fluke
4684073 she said screw it we wont use the ice vest
4684074 i have fought the good fight i have finished the race i have kept the faith finally there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge will give to me on that day and not to me only but also to all who have loved his appearing
4684075 if anyone competes in athletics he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules
4684076 blessed is the man who endures temptation for when he has been approved he will receive the crown of life which the lord has promised to those who love him
4684077 be faithful until death and i will give you the crown of life
4684078 remember that in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize you also must run in such a way that you will win all athletes practice strict self control they do it to win a prize that will fade away but we do it for an eternal prize so i run straight to the goal with purpose in every step i am not like a boxer who misses his punches i discipline my body like an athlete training it to do what it should otherwise i fear that after preaching to others i myself might be disqualified
4684079 forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead i strain to reach the end of the race and receive the prize for which god through christ jesus is calling us from heaven
4684080 since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight everything that holds us down from doing gods will and the sin unhealthy attitudes and behaviors that are out of sync with god which so easily ensnares us traps us in a bog and let us run with endurance never giving up the race that is set before us the competition our lord has assigned us
4684081 we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this age against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places
4684082 i may not have recruited gentlemen but at least we won when i was here

4684120 i was nervous that was my first time in l a so i didnt want to be bad here where i used to live
4684121 when i was touring at first i met all kinds of people
4684122 i was the first japanese girl to join the def jam tour in japan and people were a little suspicious of me and a little mean but i think that made me stronger if no one had said anything to me maybe i wouldnt be doing as well or putting so much effort into what i do maybe being put down at first has kept me from being more stuck up

4684130 the phrase we hear the most often around here is finally an art gallery
4684131 mr arnal said with a laugh as he stood on the gallerys terrace and looked at the megayachts floating in porto cervos marina in fact he said he was trying to inspire other exhibition spaces to install themselves nearby
4684132 i think that other galleries are going to set up next to us and that well develop a niche of high quality contemporary art not just some local or artisanal scene but a real contemporary art district for the international market

4684152 i know about amitji singing the singh is kinng song it happened after the toronto concert where i was on stage with the bachchans
4684153 really thats what makes him the real king of bollywood all of us who came into the industry after amitji have a lot to learn from him
4684154 akshay is far too generous and kind his current status is a remarkable lesson in hard work and self improvement to have done it under the extremely extenuating circumstances that he has faced is even more creditable
4684155 when the federal government started making schools gun free zones thats when all of these shootings started why would you put it out there that a group of people cant defend themselves thats like saying sic em to a dog
4684156 the naysayers think a shooting wont happen here if something were to happen here id much rather be calling a parent to tell them that their child is ok because we were able to protect them

4684181 we believe this offers a framework that would be win win
4684182 that allows us to close the business side of the deal and meets the needs of the public
4684183 i think it is the height of arrogance to think you can pressure federal regulators to approve the deal before theyve done their jobs
4684184 i think theres a presumption that the railroad will be given a chance to make the merger work
4684185 it may come at a higher price for the shareholders
4684186 our number one priority is to provide the appropriate programming to meet childrens needs and if we can do that inside on our own for comparable costs then thats absolutely a great way to go
4684187 we believe we can do it but weve got a lot more work to do before we get there
4684188 it the program didnt live up to the billings of it
4684189 there was no program in place we worked through the problems

4684191 indias commitments under the current terms of the proposed arrangement do not justify making far reaching exceptions to international non proliferation rules and norms
4684192 unlike 178 other countries india has not signed the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt it continues to produce fissile material and expand its nuclear arsenal as one of only three states never to have signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty npt it has not made a legally binding commitment to achieve nuclear disarmament
4684193 it will create a dangerous distinction between good proliferators and bad proliferators and sends out misleading signals to the international community with regard to npt norms
4684194 foreign nuclear fuel supplies would free up indias relatively limited domestic supplies to be used exclusively in its military nuclear sector thereby indirectly contributing to the potential expansion of indias nuclear arsenal
4684195 support measures that would avert further damage to the already beleaguered global non proliferation and disarmament regime
4684196 if nuclear testing is to be deterred meaningful penalties must be available if nsg states do agree to supply fuel for indias civilian nuclear sector they must avoid arrangements that would enable or encourage future nuclear testing by india otherwise you and your government may become complicit in the facilitation of a new round of destabilising nuclear tests
4684197 the indian nuclear deal would be a non proliferation disaster and a serious setback to the prospects of global nuclear disarmament especially now for those world leaders who are serious about ending the arms race holding all states to their international commitments and strengthening the nuclear non proliferation treaty it is time to stand up and be counted
4684198 it is in truth not for glory nor riches nor honours that we are fighting but for freedom for that alone which no honest man gives up but with life itself
4684199 i want to say mr taki thank you so much
4684200 honolulu country club has donated to lokahi 150 thousand dollars and we thank you very much for being part of our family
4684201 there must be some unlucky people or not as lucky as us we should be sharing our happiness
4684202 whats it like to be back here as the defending champ this year
4684203 well its about lokahi folks it really is just the good hearted folks of the honolulu country club that want to give
4684204 its a beautiful day the country club is a wonderful venue and everybody who participates they play from the heart they really do
4684205 whats really frustrating from our perspective is that the conservative government is removing a program that enables institutions to do what the government wants them to do which is become more responsible more businesslike more self sufficient

4684214 fresh is fresh if theyre going to advertise fresh than make it fresh
4684215 i want it to be fresh i dont want it rinsed with vinegar
4684216 the whole thing is the concern with deception consumer deception
4684217 in their advertisements when you see that little slick in the newspaper it says made fresh daily that is we felt misleading and don quijote agreed that they would discontinue that practice
4684218 you want the fish to be fresh not frozen you dont want the fish to be something thats smoked like that color smoke that they have
4684219 if its not made with fresh fish dont tell me that it was made daily fresh
4684220 theyre representing this fish commercially that its opakapaka when it absolutely not even the same species
4684221 if they are using foreign fish then they will tell us that it is foreign fish
4684222 anything thats fresh in hawaii its going to be expensive so you know if its cheap you know its from someplace else
4684223 i think its false advertising and they should pay a penalty for doing that
4684224 don quijote i applaud them safeway wishes to fight it
4684225 were going to to go at them one by one but we will going at them
4684226 you dont want to be lied to as a consumer
4684227 thanks for the timely reporting of the l a galaxy management shake up now the galaxy knows why my family did not renew their season tickets this season the lalas tenure has been terrible
4684228 ideally new interim coach cobi jones working in conjunction with paul bravo will work to redevelop a solid defense and the consistency and stability typical of past galaxy teams
4684229 one day the truth should come out about those who cowardly lurked in the shadows making decisions for the galaxy based on personal greed yet never having to be held accountable
4684230 the heart of dysfunction starts at the top for allowing these people in the door and in the end a person who truly cared for the organization is defamed
4684231 i am not surprised by the news since the galaxy has been playing very badly in the last six or seven games although ruud gullit was brilliant as a soccer player his man management did not match his soccer skills his record at chelsea and newcastle was proof
4684232 the galaxy needs a better center back and one good central holding midfield player to win the ball and help david beckham since he is not a ball winner the brilliance of beckham and landon donovan alone will not beat a team with 11 hard working players if the galaxy keeps leaking goals
4684233 you wrote donovan said he is having serious thoughts again about trying to play in europe
4684234 3 in baw ston cos im reviewing samuel adams cherry ale so pawk the caw in the yawd and grab a beer

4684237 i used yahoos webpages for years and when i found google pages i fell in love with the ease with which i can build simple sites just for friends and
4684238 i understand theres going to be a level of excitement which is great
4684239 thats prep for the regular season sometimes you look out in the stands and its tumbleweed
4684240 as this thing gets rolling the newness wears off and it gets down to playing ill keep saying this im here for one reason and thats to help this team win
4684241 i had to take my goggles off to make sure the one was next to me
4684242 when someone says you cant do something it shows you anything is possible when you put your mind to it and focus
4684243 it wasnt an easy call im going to miss that show
4684244 i couldnt listen to those fans calls on wfan this morning i just couldnt listen
4684245 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4684246 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4684247 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4684248 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4684249 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4684250 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4684251 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4684252 i had to cross the finish in first at least once
4684253 at her assent the earth blossomed she sought good things for the poor now in heaven her care is undiminished near her son she seeks the good of us all
4684254 being dragged into yet another war which we cannot afford
4684255 please stop and wait while i get a diet coke
4684256 i was a last second signing myself at the deadline so i kind of know what hes going through
4684257 i wasnt as advanced as he is i was deciding on which college to go to and i was deciding which sport to play
4684258 at the last minute i signed for pro ball after all those decisions
4684259 thats why they sent me to double a because that was the only league that was left at the time basically
4684260 we talked briefly im hoping we get it done most of thats out of my hands
4684261 i aint a lawyer dont ask me that my mom wanted me to be a lawyer thats too much school
4684262 the way our outfield is playing and jeff keppinger is playing every day
4684263 its the way i saw jerry moving at short compared to the outfield well have kepp back in there tomorrow and the next day
4684264 we dont have the power but we have more speed we have at any given time three to four center fielders in the outfield
4684265 we have more speed on the bases we can go first to third you manage more for contact were not waiting for a three run homer
4684266 they know each other on the field which is more important than the locker next to a guy
4684267 i think it probably helps them feel more comfortable being in the big leagues too
4684268 wow everything that is on this one profile page is essentially what playstation network embodies

4684746 with a selfish attitude oneself is important and others are not so important according to shantidevas advice a technique to help in turning this attitude around is to imagine in front of yourself as an unbiased observer your own selfish self on one side and a limited number of other beings on the other side ten fifty or a hundred on one side is your proud selfish self and on the other side is a group of poor needy people you are in effect in the middle as an unbiased third person now judge is this one single selfish person more important or is the group of people more important think will you join this side or that side naturally if you are a real human being your heart will go with the group because the number is greater and they are more needy the other one is just a single person proud and stupid your feeling naturally goes with the group by thinking in this way selfishness gradually decreases and respect of others grows this is is the way to practice

4684760 what you are now is the result of what you were what you will be tomorrow will be the result of what you are now the consequences of an evil mind will follow you like the cart follows the ox that pulls it the consequences of a purified mind will follow you like your own shadow no one can do more for you than your own purified mind no parent no relative no friend no one a well disciplined mind brings happiness

4684763 we are sunk in the home threatre pc space if the home user cant get their equipment to even work with our graphics or have to buy hacker software to do so even if were not the root cause

4684770 aaron brezenski has been at intel chandler az since 1995 and has been a product engineer for most of that time he currently manages a team of product development engineers in sttd but his nefarious purpose in intel software network blogspace is to highlight intel integrated graphics in the home theater pc space from an end user perspective
4684771 our competition advanced micro devices threw together a demo booth which stated baldly that hp laptops with the intel gm45 chipset did not accelerate blu ray at all while theirs naturally did
4684772 on the montevina centrino 2 system youll see the cpu utilization gets pegged up at 95 to 100 percent where the cpu utilization on the amd system will be half that
4684773 on the plus side use of the arcsoft total media theater player yielded immediate results blu ray cpu utilization on a core 2 duo was lower than 20 on all material a clear indication that hardware acceleration is working properly
4684774 they too did not see hardware acceleration on g45 blu ray playback
4684775 they updated this a couple of days later with a correction showing the acceleration working now but a less than stellar benchmark the only one they ran remains on the hd hqv test intel scored a paltry 30 out of 100
4684776 while i question the value of some of the hd hqv tests when evaluating blu ray a topic for another time they are in fact valid tests my sources tell me that intels less than stellar scores are due to a player software issue properly configured advanced de interlacing will result in scores 20 points higher still not perfect scores but coming within the realm of workable and my hope is that subsequent driver tweaks will improve this even further
4684777 suffered from stuttering every 15 seconds or so at 24 hz display refresh rate on blu ray and the issue is still there on g45 centrino 2
4684778 i skipped everything regarding gaming its not and never will be my focus
4684779 this one powers up my workout like nothing else has great energy and fat burning too
4684780 i work at a coffee shop and i get my caffeine for free
4684781 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open and honest and two way discussion
4684782 the professional developers conference on october 27 and the windows hardware engineering conference the following week represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4684783 and windows vista had driven client revenue to an average growth rate of 16 percent since it became generally available
4684784 the biggest problem vista has today is in perception a perceived lack of value and perceived instability
4684785 its hard to come up with gee whiz features for a relatively mature product but security and improved manageability and ease of deployment especially from the standpoint of ecosystem support will certainly help improve microsofts chances
4684786 to enable standard users to be able to install known good apps and prevent administrators from running known bad apps
4684787 less is more really it is microsoft went completely in the wrong direction with vista
4684788 i personally think that if you want a real hit on your hands strip down the vista os to bare bones optimise the heck out of the code and tune the baby for speed
4684789 for someone who provides tech support the registry is a nightmare
4684790 in colloquial language people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to hunker down that is to pull in like a turtle
4684791 to withdraw even from close friends to expect the worst from their community and its leaders to volunteer less give less to charity and work on community projects less often to register to vote less to agitate for social reform more but have less faith that they can actually make a difference and to huddle unhappily in front of the television
4684792 may underestimate the real effect of diversity on social withdrawal
4684793 the last hope of human liberty in this world rests on us we ought for so dear a stake to sacrifice every attachment amp every enmity
4684794 he fears that his work on the surprisingly negative effects of diversity will become part of the immigration debate even though he finds that in the long run people do forge new communities and new ties
4684795 the problem isnt ethnic conflict or troubled racial relations but withdrawal and isolation
4684796 in colloquial language people living in ethnically diverse settings appear to hunker down that is to pull in like a turtle
4684797 from the threat of ddt to the threat of heterosexual aids in america to that mass killer secondhand smoke the left believes and spreads threats that unlike the threat of islamic terror really are
4684798 you arent good enough to make it on your own
4684799 if my neighbor is rich i am not hurt by his comfort and ease on the contrary he buys from my store or my trade
4684800 the church is made up mostly of people coming out of the secular lifestyle
4684801 but the divorce rate of those raised in the church is much lower than their secularist counterparts
4684802 also capital punishment is not the same as murder so if you are referring to christians support of the death penalty you are opening a can of worms that has been dealt with on an earlier article
4684803 or any of the above have been anti other religion but that doesnt mean i want their rights taken away in our free society
4684804 do we need to toss the muslims out of the country whether born here or not whether a fresh convert or an import
4684805 no we want knowledgeable committed to peace reformers or we want them to convert from islam islam requires that its followers do not question islam but just follow its edicts
4684806 thats true but that is what secularists and leftist groups do far more than christian groups again see my profile
4684807 they are hardly comparable male circumcision does not attempt to interfere with the enjoyment of sex as does female circumcision
4684808 good intentions that end in harmful results are not ok with god
4684809 why think about what ive said read my profile study a little bit on what it is the christian is trying to follow rather than what the world assumes the christian is trying to follow youve heard just enough of the bible to be inoculated against it
4684810 to some of us other countries that like liberty the constraints of the litigious society youve created are anathema to liberty as are the colour and drug use issues and crime levels
4684811 under their rule from 1757 to 1857 indian per capita income fell but british gains were substantial
4684812 youve heard just enough of the bible to be inoculated against it
4684813 the looking up of links to sites that agree with your particular opinion and then citing them to shore up generally shaky reasoning while saying
4684814 youve heard just enough of the bible to be inoculated against it
4684815 can the left defend their political stances from their theology or are they buying the no consequence faith and applying god to it
4684816 the intent for the boy is not harm or reduction of pleasure as it is for the girl
4684817 yes it does one of the driving reasons that it became so popular in the west was that it was supposed to reduce masturbation how would it achieve this i wonder
4684818 which of these has set out in this or the last century to free another people from a despot
4684819 which one of these countries has rebuilt a nation theyve defeated and set the indigenous people up to run their own government while they backed out of controlling interest
4684820 este brasil um gigante que consome muita energia e nos d muito prazer que tenha um equil brio energ tico isso importante para n o desestabilizar o mercado

4684828 we have to give doctors the option of whether women should be allowed to practice medicine
4684829 why did they let it keep happening why didnt they say anything
4684830 working time is not the only reason for wage disparity indeed men at the start of their working lives earn on average 8 5 more than equally qualified women entering the labour market in the same sector size of company and comparable region the only really positive point to emerge from the study is that this gap has narrowed compared with the situation facing the cohorts entering the labour market in the 1970s then 10 3 increased levels of qualifications among women have undoubtedly played a role in bridging the gap wage disparities do not by any means disappear as men and women advance in their careers the authors of the study find that wage gaps between men and women widen five years after individuals enter the labour market overall across the generations studied five years into their careers men were earning an average of 26 more than their female counterparts this increase in wage disparity as careers progress is undoubtedly essentially linked to differences in employment behaviour between men and women the study points out that male female employment patterns have a major effect on wage disparities five years into their careers there are 10 more men in employment than women irrespective of the particular generation studied differences in terms of career opportunities and access to positions of responsibility must also be factored in to the equation
4684831 where are the government funded programs to research and fix this disparity if this information was reversed their would be media blitz outrage and congressional hearings etc
4684832 more and more women are taking on the model roles men used to fill in childrens lives this means more and more the issues being poured onto kids is from women
4684833 with the feminist movement even the definitions have been moved so that it is generally accepted that unwanted advances are now defined as sexual harassment
4684834 okay so we can probably agree that this is going too far but the climate that makes such a claim possible is indication of the fact that feminism itself has gone too far
4684835 there is no publicly funded program or place that gives boys and men the clear definition of what healthy sexual aggression looks like and left to women it becomes any sexual advance unless they approved of it in that instance is defined as abusive
4684836 more and more women are taking on the model roles men used to fill
4684837 are their more male victimizers of course so why arent we dealing with the roots which come from both parents and both sexes
4684838 okay so we can probably agree that this is going too far but the climate that makes such a claim possible is indication of the fact that feminism itself has gone too far
4684839 with the feminist movement even the definitions have been moved so that it is generally accepted that unwanted advances are now defined as sexual harassment
4684840 left to women it becomes any sexual advance unless they approved of it in that instance is defined as abusive
4684841 unless there is a healthy male role model to give guidance that will often be rejected by many of the loudest feminists there is no hope for a boy to grow up with a clear understanding of how to behave appropriately and how to channel all that aggression into positive outlets
4684842 the military is one of the last bastions of positive outlets to physical aggression but the sexual harassment training they receive is just as bad if not worse than what we are given in school
4684843 nobody not government not churches not schools and more and more not even parents are able or willing to give clear direction in this specific area
4684844 it is headed by feminist ideology which is giving no healthy conclusions to them
4684845 loving emotion is important nobody denies that but the feminization of our culture has resulted in the harm of our culture
4684846 and that the general rejection of masculine influence on society is harming the entire country thats why we will abolish peanuts in a school lunch menu for the sake of one child
4684847 there is a terrible lack of personal responsibility and a glaring absence of the sense of personal sacrifice for the majority
4684848 is it intuitive to masturbate against an unwilling woman in a supply closet
4684849 is it intuitive that 75 of girls between the ages of 2 18 and 50 of boys are reported to be molested
4684850 healthy sexual aggression is informed acceptable means of sexual expression rather than the current barrage of criticism and condemnation of their aggressive sexual nature
4684851 husbands love your wives just as christ loved the church and gave himself up for her
4684852 so husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies he who loves his own wife loves himself
4684853 that older women may encourage the young women to love their own husbands
4684854 a woman may slap her man punch him in the arm or throw a drink in his face but she is much less likely in most cases physically unable to beat him to a bloody pulp break his bones or throttle him around the neck
4684855 with the feminist movement even the definitions have been moved so that it is generally accepted that unwanted advances are now defined as sexual harassment
4684856 beanie i have been harassed on the job by a female boss she tried to make it a requirement for me to flirt with her and tried to fire me for not participating
4684857 i mean according to feminists men are animalistic and there is no appropriate sexual aggression it is the voice of feminism driving sex ed in schools sexual harassment training in the work place and the very language and definitions we use to describe sexual behavior in scholastic settings

4684874 people can find ways to reach their market without blogging or twittering but i think its a big advantage
4684875 it depends on the market but youve got to go where your customers are
4684876 i bought their argument that if you have something to say this is a good way to say it
4684877 and i felt like it was a good way to get more conversational with the market not just our customers or potential customers but everybody who has an opinion on the market
4684878 we invested the time and energy on day one creating a blog on a separate domain that would give us a platform to talk publicly about issues that we think are relevant
4684879 we are regularly getting what i would call inquiries from something that one of my guys has written
4684880 a couple of times a month were getting an inquiry that i dont think we would have gotten before
4684881 what other activity can i get that much discussion and penetration from out of 10 minutes of effort
4684882 the value of answering a technical question if youre a consultant and getting visibility is huge
4684883 im active on some other sites but linkedin is the only one that ive seen results from
4684884 its making the sales process more about your past work and less about how good you are on a phone call
4684885 if something catches my eye i make sure to respond
4684886 but i cant say that ive twittered something and a sale came through
4684887 its not a channel im comfortable doing a commercial relationship through yet
4684888 its much more about finding new opportunities weve never made a sale over twitter and im not expecting that wed do so
4684889 the fact that someone follows you on twitter doesnt make them a contact its not where i build relationships
4684890 after linkedin i probably drive more business out of twitter than out of anything else in terms of web 2 0
4684891 i still do more networking in the real world than i do online and i get far more business from that than ive ever got online

4684912 the claremont murders were just one of the great tragedies of western australia
4684913 i live in claremont its my electorate i know the families i know the effect on them and i know the effect on the surrounding community
4684914 the thoughts of many of the old timers are shattered in the new online casinos work released by prof labonville flott and it is high time for new ideas
4684915 i have a good deal with them i told them i will honestly tell them how i feel if i was really feeling it or hurting or anything we dont want any setbacks
4684916 thats the biggest thing i want to be ready for the first game of the season im really gauging it as well as the training staff and sean payton hes really watching me as im going and gauging how i feel and i told him i feel good
4684917 i feel very comfortable aside from terminology i have to learn that again
4684918 the concepts are the same from my first two years in the nfl so it feels really good getting back around and getting my feet on me
4684919 theres different footwork and different reads than when youre in the 3 4 defensive scheme different reads a little bit as far as the running back reads so its coming back to me and hopefully well get better as we keep going
4684920 its just getting him back into the flow of things
4684921 hes coming back off of a serious knee injury getting him back and seeing him get used to the contact again is the no 1 thing

4684924 i think many malaysian supporters would like to see it go down to the wire
4684925 less is more really it is microsoft went completely in the wrong direction with vista
4684926 i personally think that if you want a real hit on your hands strip down the vista os to bare bones optimise the heck out of the code and tune the baby for speed

4684928 both represent the first venues where we will provide in depth technical information about windows 7
4684929 mainly to open a line of two way communication between the windows 7 engineering team and windows developers
4684930 we as a team definitely learned some lessons about disclosure and how we can all too easily get ahead of ourselves in talking about features before our understanding of them is solid
4684931 our intent with windows 7 and the pre release communication is to make sure that we have a reasonable degree of confidence in what we talk about when we do talk
4684932 how has it come to pass that if i fire someone at 10 15 it is already on the web by 10 14

4684939 software has become not just employee facing but also partner facing and even customer facing there is far less room for error in such applications or in any of the applications with which they integrate if you nail the release on the first try you avoid the outrageous expense of fixing problems in production and you can devote those funds to delivering new business functions
4684940 when it comes to delivering superior software development organizations are faced with a number of challenges code complexity pace of change and constrained resources to name just a few

4684952 there are more than 2 000 verses of scripture that call us to express love and justice for those who are poor and oppressed
4684953 the religious right wants to say there is only one or two issues that reflect our values but as rick would say im sure poverty if there is 2000 verses in the bible about the poor that becomes a religious issue as well
4684954 he rick warren became fond of repeating that the bible has 2 000 verses dedicated to the poor

4685002 they took 81 out of my account but didnt give me my card i had to buy a single trip for 2 and next year these robbers are going to raise the fare again
4685003 so mr alatsaz you assume that if we were to debate we were to put a grumpy serious face and masquerade around like that as if that face is going to help us win the debate wow that is the most ridiculous assessment
4685004 well a debate is a war of minds and ideas it doesnt necessarily require a facial expression battle as well at least thats what were told by our coach and what we have experienced
4685005 what is art and what is pornography ladies and gentlemen we ought to make a line here between them here i propose a line which i think is valid if it lacks any scientific literary or critical values then bye bye we label you porn
4685006 yes they the art make you aroused and so what
4685007 and if your body didnt give you that response if you are not aroused i suggest you go to a doctor you might be frigid
4685008 do you believe in god bette because if you do this will not be complex you see god has done through all the work of sorting this for us
4685009 on that point maam excuse me george i would like to perform an intevention ladies and gentlemen miss porter here has clearly stated in the first place that whatever it is does it lack any scientific literary or critical value it directly belongs to pornography and that ladies and gentlemen is our main argument whereas miss buckleys major argument here comes from god thats the reason why i perform the intervention miss buckley if you attempt to bring up god on this topic then this debate would never exist in the first place ill tell you what were debating here is peoples perspective what people really think about the so called authorities that are banning art try and debate me buckley you know what they are they are just the latest reigning vigilante self appointed cultural watchdogs at the moment devoting countless hours and enviable resource to this bogus mission of stifiling creative expression in the name of patriotism and you know what it is ladies and gentlemen it is a distraction it is a wanton distraction because lets just be forthright and honest about what is truly unpatriotic abject poverty is unpatriotic the failure of our education system is unpatriotic lies told by presidents as justification for war is unpatriotic governmental deception corruption is unpatriotic it is unpatriotic that elected lawmakers failed to acknowledge and let alone address real desperation so miss buckley if you proceed this discussion using your present point of view then i am sorry i would have to resign george whether or not you decide to continue this debate considering the situation then i would have to leave this room ladies and gentlemen i am nurbaniyara muthmainnah and i am representing my teammates from the indonesian a team we admit and we concede that no matter how hard we try from every possible basis we cannot compete with god thank you for your attention and have a great night

4685014 sacamos algo positivo y hoy le vamos a traer algunos documentos a los concejales porque ellos nos prometieron el apoyo
4685015 los concejales van a solicitar una reuni n con la empresa y ver si se puede destrabar el conflicto
4685016 al igual que en la mayor a de los problemas el concejo deliberante es la caja de resonancia de los conflictos
4685017 el concejo no es el instrumento para resolver este tipo de problemas
4685018 como representantes de la comunidad vamos a demostrar nuestra preocupaci n porque una decisi n de despedir personal y dejar 120 sin empleo es una medida que genera conflicto por eso queremos escuchar la palabra de la empresa
4685019 tiene pasa dar varias conclusiones en primer lugar se le manifest la voluntad a los tenedores sobre la voluntad pol tica de resolver el conflicto a 20 meses de haber iniciado la ejecuci n de los expedientes
4685020 controlando los expedientes que no tengan hasta la fecha la verificaci n t cnica y partir de eso comenzar la cancelaci n de los mismos por las tres posibles situaciones de los expedientes que son los que tengan objeciones administrativas que se van a cancelar los que tengan objeciones t cnicas y administrativas que se cancelaran hasta la diferencia del perjuicio fiscal y finalmente los que las irregularidades sean de tal magnitud que se van judicializar

4685039 it is a global problem and it has severe consequences for ecosystems
4685040 it is starting to affect the resources that we pull out of the sea to feed ourselves
4685041 if we screw up the energy flow within our systems we could end up with no crabs no shrimp no fish that is where these dead zones are heading unless we stop their growth

4685043 we tested four different creams and found that all four of them increased tumor formation
4685044 its an interesting study in that it helps increase our awareness of the possibility of other factors that can influence the occurrence of skin cancer
4685045 its critically important that we dont jump to the conclusion that moisturizers cause cancer
4685046 we wanted to put the caffeine into some kind of an ointment or cream
4685047 its a super interesting paper in the sense that its addressing something thats part of our everyday lives
4685048 but its hard to believe theres a chemical in these moisturizers that acts as a carcinogen the way cigarettes do
4685049 moisturizing creams and other cosmetics actually have no toxicology testing requirements
4685050 many of the cosmetics companies used to do extensive testing to protect their customers

4685061 existe um governo eleito na ge rgia com o qual temos que falar e negociar
4685062 i write the code yea its working everything is presentable thats it
4685063 this impeachment process which can last months will be very damaging especially for the countrys economy the purpose of these talks is to settle the issue and there are many options under consideration
4685064 my belief is that the president does not intend to leave the country
4685065 i look forward to working with you to further develop the bonds of good neighborliness that unite our peoples and nations and to deepen the friendly relations that so happily exist between the two countries
4685066 we hope that election of the prime minister removes the last barrier to speedy formation of a government constructive action on key issues facing nepal and a start on the difficult but necessary task of drafting nepals new constitution
4685067 we look forward to the new government delivering to the people to meet their expectations for a prosperous future and taking forward the peace process including through creating the environment for the drafting of a constitution that secures peace stability and democracy
4685068 it wishes that the peace process will continue through the concerted efforts of all political parties so that the happiness and prosperity of nepalis will materialize at the earliest
4685069 we inquired from the police on the whereabouts of a youth who was taken away by the police they said they do not know anything about him but we know he is with them only there was a heated argument and then some officer ordered to open fire and then there was indiscriminate firing some of the people dived into the water to save their lives
4685070 it is time the disturbed areas act armed forces special powers act and other such acts be abolished and the troops are sent back i would also request the prime minister to immediately release youths of kashmir languishing in various prisons in the state
4685071 i appeal to all political parties to keep the long term interests of jammu and kashmir in view and come together to find a permanent solution to the problems of the state the sacred shrine of shri amarnath inspires all indians to march together this shrine is a shining example of our secular tradition where hindu pilgrims have been looked after for years by their muslim brothers
4685072 if he continues to stick to his position and does not resign it will create a situation leaving the government with no option but to ask the army chief to intervene and help resolve the political crisis
4685073 general kayani will be asked to intervene if the president does not show flexibility
4685074 the president is confident that they will not let him down to face a humiliating ouster at the hands of the political parties
4685075 the recent spate of news reports and rumours being spread that president pervez musharraf is resigning are totally baseless and malicious
4685076 this is terrible inexcusable behavior this man does not deserve to be president
4685077 patterns of suspicious activity in the country consistent with preparations for hijacking of planes or other types of attacks including recent surveillance of federal buildings in new york bin laden implied in u s television interviews in 1997 and 1998 that his followers would follow the example of world trade center bomber ramzi yousef and bring the fighting to america the fbi is conducting approximately 70 full field investigations throughout the u s that it considers bin laden related
4685078 if there is to be blame it properly rests here in this office and with this president and i accept responsibility for the bad as well as the good

4685083 every bureaucracy in this town is scared to death of an investigation mccain of course could only be referring to bush and his executive branch of the government since everyone in the democratic party supported the creation of the commission no one has really been held accountable by bush no one has lost their job i e bush hadnt fired anyone no one has even been reprimanded by bush nothing has happened as a result of september 11 unless responsibility is assigned then we cant cure the problem
4685084 the question we pose to the white house today is do you really want to allow this commission to be created

4685115 federal election laws stipulate that an event such as the one saddleback church is hosting must provide pre established and objective criteria for inviting candidates
4685116 the church must be reminded that it is not the master or the servant of the state but rather the conscience of the state it must be the guide and the critic of the state and never its tool

4685143 the things i thought were so important because of the effort i put into them have turned out to be of small value and the things i never thought about the things i was never able to either to measure or to expect were the things that mattered
4685144 obviously being 21 years old this is the first of this type of experience for me it was different im extremely excited to be a giant and i cant wait to get started
4685145 its been a long wait since the draft but well worth it to get him here
4685146 we need to bring in lots of players like him
4685147 thats what were doing i dont like to put a timetable on anybody and im definitely not going to put one here on buster all i can say is he has the ability and the makeup to become a team player in our organization that can help us win

4685155 we worked extremely hard we were extremely competitive in trying to sign him we offered a major league contract dollar wise we offered more than brian matusz got we were there doing everything we could to sign the player obviously were disappointed we were very pleased with drafting him and wanted to sign him
4685156 we gave them a major league contract in this process we gave them an out of box deal in this process and every other agent we were talking to was asking for the same thing but i can tell you the only time we ever got a figure from them was on august 12 that was the first time we got a figure from them and that was 9 million
4685157 we wanted to sign him we drafted him we liked the pitcher we really wanted to sign him we gave a tremendous effort to sign him
4685158 our intention the entire time was to sign the player we werent able to get an agreement at the deadline we worked very hard for it we went above and beyond our budget we went above and beyond the market brian matusz was the first pitcher taken in the draft he went fourth in the country to baltimore we went north of that offer to get a deal done and werent able to get it done the market for pitchers in this market was very clear we offered our pitcher more than anybody in this draft we wanted to sign the player
4685159 ive been a catcher a broadcaster a coach a manager i cant remember him throwing a wild pitch
4685160 i was running on that pitch you just cant get picked in a situation like that

4685192 but more often concern about his emerging overconfidence which is making it difficult to interact with him
4685193 you get a sense they are concerned that the al maliki regime has an inflated sense of his power
4685194 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
4685195 we have to be careful in each word we write
4685196 if we write something that isnt in favour of the militants resistance groups the military or the government then we are in a dangerous situation
4685197 for being iraqis we are in a more delicate situation because we dont have anywhere to hide or anyone to support
4685198 sometimes we have to hide behind foreigners to be protected
4685199 nothing is being done to protect journalists covering the iraq situation
4685200 it is becoming intolerable especially when you see that the proposed democracy is just for politicians but not for other professionals or ordinary iraqis
4685201 in addition to being easy targets to survive we have to accept working as journalists but having our names hidden while foreigners take all the credit by using our stories under their by line
4685202 they dont offer any protection and even if we are killed our families dont have the right of insurance as they have
4685203 my son was killed for speaking with a journalist about us elections
4685204 they made him two questions and it was enough reason for them to kill him he wasnt aware of the new law imposed in our district and was a victim of the daily violence in iraq where democracy is just an illusion
4685205 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
4685206 there was a reason once for these barriers a security reason but now its gone so why not remove them
4685207 this side used to be all restaurants now they are closed nobody sees them from the road nobody goes there
4685208 yeah were not going to be as secure as we used to be but in order to stimulate economic development we have to make a compromise
4685209 most of the complaints that were hearing have to do with inconvenience
4685210 closes people off to an extent but it also makes it safer
4685211 a true patriot is a lover of his country who rebukes and does not excuse its sins
4685212 police chief ghanim al quraishi gave orders to organise the fighting in this district hwaider very secretly
4685213 the 2nd battalion of iraqi police moved to hwaider whose people witnessed severe military clashes between the mehdi army and police
4685214 a big verbal quarrel took place earlier in the governors office between al quraishi who is a badr organisation member and followers of sadr

4685228 the challenge now is to take what we have built combine it with what we have come to understand about markets and then make it all available on a customizable homepage said sean lee ceo of buzz
4685229 we have been developing some very exciting database applications specifically built for ad agencies that centre around multi lingual and multi lingual semantic database search this cuts the cost and improves the efficiency of marketers that are looking to operate in all of asias markets that cover not only many countries but many ethnic groups languages and dialects with in each market
4685230 i know the academy of baseball betting design and production respects my work and im confident that i will win an award one of these days
4685231 i was completely flabberghasted i planned to attend the annual baseball betting award night for fun and the after parties but lo and behold i walked home with an award for best new analysis and statistical measurement in a baseball betting project
4685232 it is always very good to showcase local talent during important events so that others outside of our baseball betting industry can benefit from this special night
4685233 to win an award here really means something i happily dedicate this achievement to my wife and family who have put up with my work schedule for the past years
4685234 the most thorough manner to approach baseball betting is through a methodical analysis of trends upward and downward movement and of course changes in the consumer aread
4685235 i was hoping to get it down to three or four guys by now

4685241 were not looking for the neckroll 260 pound guy that cant move and runs straight ahead were looking for an athletic tough strong guy guys like kyle and eric those guys are hard to find theyre big and strong and have good feet thats the prototype that were looking for teich is not as big right now but hes got really good feet
4685242 im used to the wear and tear of getting pounded

4685254 this was a pre planned event that endangered his child
4685255 if he had chosen to land at an airport we would not be here today
4685256 the fact that you argue that they may not be able to prove their charges does not warrant their dismissal
4685257 we believe this offers a framework that would be win win
4685258 that allows us to close the business side of the deal and meets the needs of the public

4685260 i think theres a presumption that the railroad will be given a chance to make the merger work
4685261 it may come at a higher price for the shareholders
4685262 our number one priority is to provide the appropriate programming to meet childrens needs and if we can do that inside on our own for comparable costs then thats absolutely a great way to go
4685263 we believe we can do it but weve got a lot more work to do before we get there
4685264 it the program didnt live up to the billings of it
4685265 there was no program in place we worked through the problems

4685291 any geographic areas for which the executive has been responsible during the two year period before the date the executives employment terminates
4685292 virtually indistinguishable from the ones at issue here where the geographical limitation is defined with reference to the territories in which an employee worked prior to termination
4685293 long recognized that under the common law an employee including an employee at will owes a fiduciary duty of loyalty to his employer during his employment
4685294 the more specific duty that the employee not compete with his employer during his employment
4685295 a tort action exists against one who intentionally interferes with anothers contractual rights
4685296 i cant think of a more beautifully self involved gift then to send someone your own action figure
4685297 vaguely not really no i didnt expect it to run as long and as strong having done a lot of tv and seeing the nature of the television industry its rare when an audience comes out with so much passion its doesnt seem to happen in the television business all that often its been a really nice surprise
4685298 its more a series of what tv shows didnt make it would be the more appropriate question
4685299 i give him crap all the time and he takes it hes got a fan base too if we had a lot more money wed probably have him on the show all the time
4685300 i sleep with everyone and then i hate everybody and then i sleep with them again thats pretty much the way that one goes but stay tuned because its how you sleep with people thats really interesting
4685301 thats what we need a really good villain ess you know what thats a good idea im going to go pitch that story in about 5 minutes to brad wright laughter
4685302 this guy puts his worse foot forward when hes in a new situation and hes nervous about his new job that brings out the worst qualities in him as he gets to know them he opens up and shows new sides he has other qualities and hes really trying to turn himself into a good leader his most redeeming quality is that he really really cares about doing the best job that he can its just that hes not good at showing things really well as hes not good inter personally hes not a warm guy
4685303 when youre sent in to evaluate someone you dont want to buddy up to them because theyre under your microscope its been a career strength for him that hes not a cuddly guy hes the one who has come in gathered the data done the interviews and written a report that assigns blame points the finger at someone now hes the one who is going to have the finger pointed at him now hes the guy whos in the hot seat thats inherently the irony of that situation and inherently cool and interesting for me as an actor now i am on the playing field and i cannot simply sit in my armchair and watch the game
4685304 remember i come from star trek where we had a different rubber forehead every week so im not necessarily good at remembering the names
4685305 the writers are building in enough revealing moments often when im alone and theyve been very anxious to hear my input i had a suggestion that was put into the end of the third episode i thought it would be fun if when woolsey goes back to his room to relax he puts on a business suit and a tie and sits and listens to music and has a glass of wine but he dresses up to relax that to me would say there is a part of his old life that he misses the civility many men that live in a business suit hate it but i think there is something about him that that is his old uniform of 35 years and he misses it he likes the new job but he misses the civilized nature of having a crisp shirt on a tie a perfectly groomed suit and relaxing that way we play on that maybe two times so far its referenced a third time but now to show that he really feels comfortable in his new uniform that shows a man who is growing into his new job or filling amanda tappings shoes
4685306 in your time off if you want to go do a play you have the money to go do that you dont have to make decisions based on financial concerns because that part is taken care of so it gives you all kinds of freedom to do creative and different things whether its travel take time off write a book or do something with my children or go on an extended college tour i have the freedom to do all this other stuff because im now working steadily for seven months of the year but more than that star trek has given me a dedicated group of fans who like to watch me and they watch me in any other show i pop up in theyre particularly gratified to see me pop up in another science fiction show that they like anyway its been a win win for me and i also think im the first actor to play a regular part in both of the major science fiction franchises straddling two studio franchises like a colossus
4685307 they tease me and pull my hair and i think thats cause they love me like on the schoolyard when youre kids
4685308 thats the only thing that stressed me out i knew that no matter what people were going to be sad about it i had huge shoes to fill i just kinda had to let go of that and get it out of my head and do my own thing i feel better about it now especially since paul mcgillion is coming back
4685309 it was such an amazing time and all of our lives we were so very close but at the same time its so nice to be with a show that has their groove and its a well oiled machine everybody keeps saying that but its true its nice coming on to something where everybody knows exactly what theyre doing and its a very relaxed environment
4685310 kaylee was such a lovable character and i was really lucky to play that character thats all joss whedon i hoped that since people accepted her that they would give me a chance a little bit and i think they did last year at the comic con panel i notice people wearing the jayne hat and being there in the audience to support me and that made me feel really good
4685311 yeah the little engine that could i guess who knew we thought no one was watching us
4685312 shes quirkier and very loving more friendships this year and more warmth and possibly romance
4685313 romance makes the characters more real and shows tend to shy away from that

4685329 lets get this online casinos project underway and take cues from www whitehouse gov as needed
4685330 because my experience has been that online casinos companies such as these are one in a million sometimes the best of ideas are just not feasible simply because online casinos consumers like those found on www wired com or www auburn edu are not ready for a new paradigm
4685331 im happy to see that my collegue hoyle noonon believes in this project
4685332 this project will help all involved greatly and will move things forward dramatically
4685333 i see good things for this online casinos startup company
4685334 and you can bet the ranch that things are only going to get better
4685335 we need a few venture capitalists with guts and cash
4685336 i want this online casinos project to take off and go somewhere and your support in this online casinos event is a great start
4685337 were working hard to improve our search engine rankings because this will increase our nfl betting sales like never before
4685338 the thoughts of many of the old timers are shattered in the new nfl betting work released by prof yuricic sheeks and it is high time for new ideas
4685339 theres no such thing as a starving artist in this nfl betting production industry

4685341 my name is vermin love supreme and im running for president
4685342 in some ways if you know youre going to lose expressing your true beliefs is more important i think thats what you have with some candidates
4685343 maybe you have an issue that you really care about or you get a story written about you
4685344 winning is a long shot but it is a realistic possibility
4685345 ronald reagan didnt have a great chance of winning when he first started running jimmy carter had very little chance of winning when he first started running
4685346 the republican party left me the republican party is no longer the one i joined and worked with for three decades
4685347 it is no longer the party of small government and lower taxes it is a party that very clearly is illustrated by the bush administration that believes in absolute power residing in the executives
4685348 remove our economic security blanket that is costing the american people billions of dollars every month
4685349 the libertarians have actually become much more of a factor
4685350 they win some local elections and the greens win some local elections in small towns but even in a state like georgia where hes most likely to do well i doubt he gets even 5 percent of the vote
4685351 theyre the greatest years america had they were the last years we balanced the budget until nixon if america knew that all of our problems were coming from alcohol they would go dry overnight again
4685352 hes running because this issue is so important to him
4685353 its an attempt to get an issue you care about and give it some life
4685354 i really see successful third parties as correctives to failures of the major parties
4685355 when a major party fails third parties serve as safety valves which alert the major parties about their failures and give them a chance to respond
4685356 we would never do anything to hurt one of the movies or the series we love our fans
4685357 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4685358 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4685359 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4685360 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4685361 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4685362 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4685363 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4685364 i like mine with lettuce and tomato heinz 57 and french fried potatoes

4685371 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
4685372 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

4685410 that was the first preseason game and everybody was kind of working out the kinks
4685411 as we get into more of these preseason games more of the offense is installed and more of the defense is installed and youll probably see some more looks that might give you problems that you might want to take a look at its really kind of expect the unexpected
4685412 you kind of get that excited feeling the night before almost feel like its a game type atmosphere because there is some unexpectedness
4685413 were back at our home facility and thats nice being able to step out on these fields which look as good as theyve ever looked is nice its good to be back in new orleans and able to compete against another team
4685414 i felt him but you just step up avoid and do all those things youve done your entire life when guys are chasing you
4685415 he has such a good feel for the game he has a complete understanding of what theyre doing and what the defense is trying to do too
4685416 hes very mobile and he makes so many plays on the move when you play against him youve got to try to keep him in the pocket
4685417 weve installed our base stuff and we feel like we know it pretty well
4685418 whatevers thrown at us we feel like we should be able to combat with what weve been taught
4685419 families is where our nation finds hope where wings take dream

4685426 the other two guys in the threesome were struggling on that hole especially around the green and i had probably five to 10 minutes before putting
4685427 i just really tried to see it going in the hole over and over again
4685428 i called him and told him id hopefully be joining him down there
4685429 sure enough i sent him a text message after i qualified and said see you down there
4685430 robs game has matured enough now that when he needs to make birdies when he needs to score he makes it happen
4685431 hes such a competitor he truly just wills the ball into the hole its an amazing thing to watch
4685432 he doesnt show virtually any emotion on the golf course and i think thats a huge advantage for him that keeps his emotions in check and it can also be intimidating for his opponents
4685433 its so nice to see their hard work being rewarded

4685442 its really thrilling for me to do this production here because i have my roots here in the philippines i was 10 years old when my grandmother has fallen ill so i asked my parents to let me spend my summer vacation here to visit my grandmother in cebu at the back of my mind if she passed away i wouldnt be able to retrieve the story of my family
4685443 golden child is the title because the lead character refers to his daughter as his golden child or lucky charm in business or whenever he gambles

4685488 the crown that prachanda is given is a crown of thorn
4685489 there are serious challenges for the new prime minister and our own support to his government will be dependent on the maoists actions and their ability to address our demands
4685490 ethnic groups have the capability of bringing the country to a virtual standstill
4685491 we have seen the ethnic groups most notably the madhesi parties using strike to press their demands during the past year and they will do the same now if they are not given what they want
4685492 in the past maoists have branded these groups as terrorists and blamed the government for not being able to stop their actions
4685493 it will be interesting to see how they will deal with these groups
4685494 we will sit in the opposition and play an active role
4685495 the maoists are yet to abide by their past agreement to return seized property of the people and act like a democratic party
4685496 we talk about power sharing but the maoists want to keep all the influential ministries for themselves
4685497 we are concerned about concentrating too much power in the hands of a political party that has a separate armed unit
4685498 the maoists will need the support of nepali congress to draft the constitution as ethnic groups despite supporting prachandas candidacy for prime minister are likely to bargain on their demands to extract maximum benefits in their favour
4685499 people elected the maoists to see changes in their daily lives and they expect the new government to address issues such as inflation power and fuel shortage and tackle crime and deteriorating security situation

4685507 we want to avoid any armed conflict and we will not have armed conflict
4685508 thats not the solution to this problem but we have to stand up for freedom and democracy as we did in the darkest days
4685509 you know i think he spends less time on his presidential campaign these days and lots of time on georgia
4685510 and i really appreciate that because senator mccain has been fighting for freedom of georgia for many many years
4685511 that is horrifyingly similar to that taken by stalin and hitler in the 1930s
4685512 we are much more worried by georgian imperialism than russian imperialism

4685518 dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat bersumpahlah orang orang yang berdosa
4685519 aduhai celakalah kami siapakah yang membangkitkan kami dari tempat tidur kami kubur inilah yang dijanjikan tuhan yang maha pemurah dan benarlah rasul rasulnya
4685520 maka apakah mereka tidak memperhatikan al quran kalau sekiranya al quran itu bukan dari sisi allah swt tentulah mereka mendapat pertentangan yang banyak di dalamnya
4685521 kepada mereka dinampakkan neraka pada pagi dan petang maksudnya menampakkan kepada mereka neraka pagi dan petang sebelum hari berbangkit dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat
4685522 allah meneguhkan iman orang orang yang beriman dengan ucapan yang teguh itu dalam kehidupan dunia dan di akherat
4685523 kalau kamu melihat ketika pada malaikat mencabut jiwa orang orang yang kafir seraya memukul muka dan belakang mereka dan berkata
4685524 dari amrah binti abd al rahman dari aisyah isteri nabi saw bahwa orang orang yahudi bertanya kepada aisyah
4685525 wahai manusia mohonlah kepada allah dari siksa kubur sesungguhnya siksa kubur adalah haq
4685526 apakah kamu merasa bahwa telah diwahyukan kepadaku bahwa kalian akan disiksa dalam kubur
4685527 allah meneguhkan iman orang orang yang beriman dengan ucapan yang teguh itu dalam kehidupan dunia dan di akherat
4685528 seorang muslim bila ditanya di dalam kubur akan bersaksi bahwa tidak ada tuhan selain allah dan mohammad utusan allah
4685529 allah meneguhkan iman orang orang yang beriman dengan ucapan yang teguh itu dalam kehidupan dunia dan di akherat
4685530 kepada mereka dinampakkan neraka pada pagi dan petang maksudnya menampakkan kepada mereka neraka pagi dan petang sebelum hari berbangkit dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat
4685531 ayat ini adalah ayat paling asal yang digunakan istidlal oleh ahlu sunnah tentang adanya siksa barzakh di dalam kubur
4685532 kepada mereka dinampakkan neraka pada pagi dan petang maksudnya menampakkan kepada mereka neraka pagi dan petang sebelum hari berbangkit dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat
4685533 ada yang menyatakan bahwa ayat ini menunjukkan penyiksaan terhadap orang kafir di barzakh akan tetapi ayat itu tidak berhubungan dengan siksa bagi kaum muslimin atas dosa dosanya di dalam kuburnya
4685534 sungguh hal ini sangat sulit sebab surat ibrahim 27 dan al ghafir 46 adalah surat makiyah pemecahannya adalah sebagai berikut
4685535 ibnu haram dan ibnu habirah menyatakan bahwa persoalan ini terjadi pada ruh saja tidak menimpa pada jasad
4685536 kemudian ditiup lagi sangkakala lalu kami kumpulkan mereka itu semuanya
4685537 kepada mereka dinampakkan neraka pada pagi dan petang maksudnya menampakkan kepada mereka neraka pagi dan petang sebelum hari berbangkit dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat
4685538 dan dialah tuhan yang disembah di langit dan tuhan yang disembah di bumi dan dia lah yang maha bijaksana lagi maha mengetahui
4685539 kepada mereka dinampakkan neraka pada pagi dan petang maksudnya menampakkan kepada mereka neraka pagi dan petang sebelum hari berbangkit dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat
4685540 ada hadits hadits yang meriwayatkan tentang siksa kubur selain hadits hadits ini kemudian ia menyebut enam buah hadits yang diriwayatkan oleh bukhari pada bab ini sebagian diriwayatkan dari abu hurairah ibnu abbas abu ayyub said zaid bin arqam ummu khalid dalam shahih bukhari muslim atau di salah satu dari keduanya juga dari jabir abu said menurut ibnu mardawaih dari umar abd al rahman bin hasanah dan abd al amru menurut abu dawud dan dari ibnu masud menurut al thahawiy dari abu bakrah asma bin yazid menurut al nasaiy dan dari ibnu mubasysyir menurut ibnu abi syaibah dan dari selain mereka
4685541 para ulama berbeda pendapat dalam menetapkan jumlah minimal yang dapat menghasilkan ilmu kepastian
4685542 oleh karena itu kami berpendapat bahwa jaminan mutawatir adalah ilmu yang dihasilkan dari sebuah berita berita yang tidak menghasilkan ilmu tidak boleh dijadikan sandaran untuk berdalil sebab dalilnya sendiri telah jatuh ke dalam wijdaan persangkaan ini adalah syarat syarat yang telah diakui keabsahannya untuk menetapkan kemutawatiran sebuah berita
4685543 jikalah allah menghukum manusia karena kedzalimannya niscaya tidak akan ditinggalkan nya di muka bumi sesuatupun dari makhluk yang melata tetapi allah menangguhkan mereka sampai kepada waktu yang ditentukan maka apabila telah tiba waktunya yang ditentukan bagi mereka tidaklah mereka dapat mengundurkannya barang sesaatpun dan tidak pula mendahulukannya
4685544 dan kalau sekiranya allah menyiksa manusia disebabkan usahanya niscaya dia tidak akan meninggalkan di atas permukaan bumi suatu makluk yang melatapun akan tetapi allah menangguhkan penyiksaan mereka sampai waktu yang tertentu maka apabila datang ajal mereka maka sesungguhnya allah adalah maha melihat keadaan hamba hambanya
4685545 dan ditiuplah sangkakala maka tiba tiba mereka keluar dengan segera dari kuburnya menuju kepada tuhan mereka
4685546 aduhai celakalah kami siapakah yang membangkitkan kami dari tempat tidur kami kubur inilah yang dijanjikan tuhan yang maha pemurah dan benarlah rasul rasulnya
4685547 pertentangan antara ayat ini dengan hadits hadits tentang siksa kubur tidak mungkin dikompromikan dengan berbagai bentuk kompromi
4685548 dan pada hari terjadinya kiamat bersumpahlah orang orang yang berdosa
4685549 dan orang orang yang diberi ilmu pengetahuan dan keimanan kepada orang orang yang kafir

4685557 we have a lot of middle schoolers this year and thats good but there are also some high school kids
4685558 and i think the turnout is a little better this year
4685559 they tell us what they want to do and we try to accommodate them
4685560 these kids are very involved with this if they werent involved they probably wouldnt come its a great way for them to feel supported by their community
4685561 and we do see changes come about in these kids

4685566 it just never occurred to me until a friend suggested it
4685567 the library wasnt one of my usual stops but now we check out movies here all the time and i wonder why i ever paid
4685568 some people seem to be realizing that we have a lot more than books they can get movies at no cost or music sometimes you have to get on a waiting list for the newest releases but it is free

4685574 younger women dont seem to have an opinion either on mccain or obama
4685575 serious conversation gets going and everybody tends to join in in general both men and women are talking about it
4685576 you hear a lot of personal stuff we are one of the few professions that can legally touch you clients will tell us anything once you deal with a client we are like a family member
4685577 most people arent on board with or excited about either one of them we were joking in here that maybe we ought to just start all over
4685578 one comment i heard is that nowadays you have to be a big fundraiser to run for president thats a shame
4685579 a lot of my clients were disappointed when hillary was not going to run for president
4685580 id say the biggest thing im hearing now is about the price of gasoline and groceries
4685581 most of my customers are talking about gambling or hunting
4685582 they are all into the texas hold em game were way out in the boondocks out here weve only had a phone for 13 years
4685583 ive heard their music and we wanted to see them in person
4685584 this is our fifth year and the objective of these jubilees is to bring people downtown and create a real community event
4685585 and i think this is one of the best reflections on our community
4685586 when you can get a crowd like this out it really says something about the community
4685587 and events like the mayors jubilee allow us to talk to people and get out a lot of information about the veterans walk
4685588 what you do is once you find the dead animal i just threw it into the bag brought it home and wed bury it
4685589 the coyote was huge maybe 45 to 50 pounds and we found it dead in our front yard
4685590 it looked like it had been hit by a car it was sad to see but a little weird to think of him wandering around in my front yard
4685591 home school is less books and more hands on and a lot of discussion
4685592 we hang out it was just the two of us it will be hard
4685593 ive never been to school before but i think it will be somewhere between tough and fun
4685594 i never met my teacher last year but i could talk to her i never even saw her
4685595 i met one classmate from online at the end of the year exams
4685596 he had a huge list of things to do every day it was tedious
4685597 i do think that it was a good transition between home school and public school
4685598 it was a big part of my identity we didnt have books when we studied weather the kids and i took a blanket out on the back lawn and laid down and watched the clouds and talked about them they learned a lot from life
4685599 there was so much flexibility if we wanted to take off and go down and watch the new bridge being built we did it if we wanted to begin class a bit later in the morning we could
4685600 when they were ready there is no talking them out of it
4685601 this time will be easier for me than when they all grow up and leave home this is like a transitional empty nest i only am empty from 7 a m to 3 p m
4685602 i am really happy to be here i am the afghanistan champion
4685603 this is my first time at the olympics there is no problem with the scarf no one embarrassed me
4685604 the whole iraq team for instance is here by invitation
4685605 i am not happy with the result i was scared of a false start
4685606 i am very happy this is the challenge of a lifetime i thank the lord to be here at the games
4685607 i hope that this year will be better for the relations between israelis and palestinians
4685608 the only thing i can tell you at this time is that the offer from the toll road was rejected by the membership
4685609 or else i will come unto thee quickly and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent
4685610 yea the light of the wicked shall be put out and the spark of his fire shall not shine the light shall be dark in his tabernacle and his candle shall be put out with him
4685611 and will remove thy candlestick out of his place except thou repent

4685613 thy body also is full of darkness take heed therefore that the light which is in thee be not darkness if thy whole body therefore be full of light having no part dark the whole shall be full of light as when the bright shining of a candle doth give thee light

4685640 men have extra sexual desires which a single woman alone cant satisfy
4685641 if you go into a drug store to buy condoms the ones they sell are mainly suited to men with the average penis length of 14 5 centimetres 5 51 inches but a lot of people have penises that are smaller or larger than that
4685642 we thought why not come up with a condom that fits the man rather than vice versa this would represent a revolution in the condom market

4685667 if youre looking to make good money in the online casinos field you need an internet presence and a great website
4685668 im floored this online casinos news is shocking but also somewhat exciting to hear
4685669 i can say with little doubt that this online casinos argument is sound
4685670 and i believe this will be a cornerstone in online casinos thinking
4685671 me relaj al ver que casi lo hab a hecho
4685672 estoy en la final que es lo importante un poco decepcionado pero bien pens encontrarme un poco mejor ahora tengo tres d as para organizar mis esquemas y sensaciones me falt ritmo solamente eso tendr que hacer un par de ajustes

4685681 closest supporters friends since you are among our closest supporters i want to make you aware of some problems senator cornyn is experiencing with the houston

4685688 at the present time i dont believe we can afford to spend the money
4685689 our part 69 000 is a small amount when you consider what it would cost future councils down the road
4685690 in the coming budget year i would encourage us to keep it in the forefront
4685691 not in a tone of anger but more to say what needs to be said
4685692 comrades the content of this bill is s comrades this s has got to stop
4685693 we need to tell our labor politicians that what they did was wrong we need to tell the community that the industrial movement is poles apart with parliamentary labor on this issue
4685694 we need to tell labor politicians that we expect to retain their genuine labor values not trash them
4685695 it is my hope above all hope that every single delegate to this convention will stand shoulder to shoulder and side by side with the workers and support his censure motion
4685696 i was not prepared to stand by and watch the cost of the scheme grow thereby reducing the states competitive advantage maintaining the status quo was not an option
4685697 i think that its time our labor politicians recognised that if they want to be in accord with the general labor populous then theyve got to consider the trade unions and they cant continue with arrogance
4685698 expect confusion the first week because even though we sent out passenger bulletins and weve been talking about if a long time there will always be some people who dont realize whats happening
4685699 during construction there will be virtually the same number of parking spaces as pre construction then post construction virtually the same number as pre construction
4685700 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4685701 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4685702 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read
4685703 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4685704 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4685705 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic

4685708 both candidates in a different way have a religion problem
4685709 this event gives each of them a chance to talk directly to those concerns
4685710 in michigan every percentage point could make the difference this year so it could be very helpful to obama to be at this event and try to resonate with evangelicals
4685711 obama talks to evangelicals in a way thats unusual for a democrat and theres been a lack of enthusiasm for mccain in michigan but i expect most evangelicals will still vote republican
4685712 saturday could be a very big day in determining whether republicans continue to have a hammerlock on this important group of voters
4685713 i have a purpose and that purpose i think is to live a life based on judeo christian principles and honor and integrity
4685714 in time i came to see faith as more than just a comfort to the weary or a hedge against death but rather as an active palpable agent in the world and in my own life
4685715 many of us would rather watch a noisy demonstration of miracles signs and wonders than have a quiet bible study yet we are faced today with the sad reality that our untempered zeal is a sign of immaturity our adolescent craving for the wild and crazy makes us do stupid things its way past time for us to grow up
4685716 true revival will be accompanied by brokenness humility reverence and repentance not the arrogance showmanship and empty hype that often was on display in lakeland
4685717 a prominent pentecostal evangelist called me this week after bentleys news hit the fan
4685718 im now convinced that a large segment of the charismatic church will follow the anti christ when he shows up because they have no discernment
4685719 no they give you an injection but you are still awake
4685720 well when my wife has a baby i am going to make sure i am away in china on a business trip

4685723 that the young are always at the centre of the herd where they are protected the old buffalos move to the outside of the herd so they can offer themselves to their brothers the wolves and keep the young safe
4685724 i am becoming just like those old buffalos my life is all for the people now
4685725 o great spirit whose voice i hear in the winds and whose breath gives life to all the world hear me i am small and weak i need your strength and wisdom let me walk in beauty and make my eyes ever behold the red and purple sunset make my hands respect the things i have made and my ears sharp to hear your voice make me wise so that i may understand the things you have taught my people let me learn the lessons you have hidden in every leaf and rock i seek strength not to be greater than my brother but to fight my greatest enemy myself make me always ready to come to you with clean hands and straight eyes so when life fades as the fading sunset my spirit may come to you without shame

4685733 yo no tengo el certificado porque me he saltado sem foros
4685734 no puedo hablar demasiado tengo que concentrarme en la conducci n
4685735 m s importante de lo que pueda decir la estad stica era un excelente anotador pero con el paso de los a os ha enfocado su juego hacia otras facetas en pek n ha jugado una media de once minutos y no ha lanzado ni una vez a canasta pasa muy bien defiende much simo y da orden al juego
4685736 un futuro mvp es muy creativo tanto en el bloqueo y la continuaci n como abriendo el bal n a los aleros su temporada ha sido espectacular no es muy alto pero s muy fuerte posee un centro de gravedad bajo que beneficia sus movimientos lleva el ritmo del equipo
4685737 junto a paul el mejor base de la nba mueve al equipo tira bien desde fuera penetra y pasa muy bien en ataque lo tiene casi todo no se sale nunca de tono tiene muy buenas piernas y eso le permite defender con garant as
4685738 ha salido de una lesi n hace poco y eso le ha perjudicado es muy r pido tiene algunos problemas para tirar pero en pek n ha llegado f cil a la canasta sale como una bala y si da el primer paso antes que t m s vale que reces
4685739 es el jugador con m s talento del mundo y el alma de esta selecci n hace mucho m s que anotar un aspecto que si es necesario sacrifica para defender m s es el que m s transmite de todos
4685740 es muy buen defensor con unos brazos muy largos que le benefician a la hora de interceptar balones como ricky rubio es muy r pido no lanza mucho pero s tiene buenos porcentajes puede jugar de cuatro le gusta jugar de poste de ah que en la nba est sobre los diez rebotes de media
4685741 es su mejor tirador el m s puro aunque tambi n puede jugar por dentro lo utilizan para tirar desde las esquinas tiene algunos problemas de movilidad lateral a la hora de defender
4685742 su f sico es nico en el mundo posee la velocidad de un dos maneja el bal n como un base y tiene la fuerza de un cinco es un buen tirador aunque a rachas y penetrando posee una fuerza descomunal
4685743 es un jugador muy talentoso le gusta mucho correr al contraataque a veces pasa del rebote defensivo para pedir un pase r pido buen reboteador ofensivo
4685744 una bestia sin ser enorme posee un f sico privilegiado a dos o tres metros del aro es imparable es un grand simo intimidador hay que conseguir que no se acerque a esa zona
4685745 es un jugador ambidiestro que puede jugar por igual y con la misma eficacia en los dos postes bajos es muy buen reboteador y adem s posee un buen lanzamiento de cinco o seis metros no tiene el protagonismo que merece por su talento
4685746 mi ex compa ero es muy dif cil de marcar a cuatro o cinco metros del aro su primer paso hacia la izquierda y botando con esa mano es muy r pido propio de un base le gusta correr al contraataque por la calle central y lanzar en gancho desde tres o cuatro metros en pek n est en unos porcentajes de tiro muy superiores a los que en l son habituales
4685747 intent concentrarme en el 200 estilos pero el dolor que se me qued en el cuerpo tras la espalda fue insuperable
4685748 posiblemente sea mi perdici n pero he almorzado y he cenado en el mcdonalds todos los d as desde que llegu

4685761 cuando llegu no lo esperaba estaba muy cansado y sin jugar mi mejor tenis ste ha sido un d a importante aun si pierdo tendr una medalla para m y para espa a eso es una cosa incre ble
4685762 por mi mentalidad considero que soy m s un jugador de equipo que individual
4685763 los deportes de equipo me gustan desde peque o y lo que siento cuando juego as es totalmente distinto a cuando juego para m
4685764 cuando juego en el extranjero tambi n represento a espa a pero es en competiciones como sta cuando representas a tu pa s al ciento por ciento
4685765 entr y tuve la misma sensaci n que pudieron tener los gladiadores al salir a la arena del circo de roma
4685766 no he sabido estar a la altura y me he llevado una gran decepci n
4685767 estaba seguro de mis posibilidades ten a la t cnica bastante ajustada pero no he sabido solventar la situaci n estaba para hacer 20 50m sin ning n problema y no he sido capaz
4685768 ha sido un golpe muy fuerte ten a muchas ilusiones no me he llevado una decepci n tan grande desde hace muchos a os debo mirar al futuro y a o a a o plantearme si voy a seguir o no compitiendo
4685769 nada hace m s feliz al diablo que ver la poca ropa de las mujeres en las olimpiadas
4685770 you give me love and help me find the sun every time i was down you will come around and get my feet back on the ground
4685771 i need to perform better than i did and i know that is the expectation but ive always thought skating was the biggest part of my game and last season i couldnt skate like i can
4685772 as dijo jehov no aprend is el camino de las naciones ni de las se ales del cielo teng is temor aunque las naciones las teman
4685773 this is a worrying trend and the mic its youth wing and the social strategic foundation yss have decided to meet the police to find a solution
4685774 were inviting indian youths from all quarters to also come forward with their own proposals on how to solve this pressing problem
4685775 a plat ia se animou e se emocionou com m sicas como
4685776 oh look another priceless work of profound art from the renaissance whose equal will never again be known whats over here
4685777 political and press offences will be tried openly and in the presence of a jury in courts of justice
4685778 but i have to be honest i would be surprised if arkansas did not have something similar
4685779 kak i noticed that girls buttocks are bigger than boys
4685780 so i think that when girls eat their stomachs dont grow big because all the food goes to the buttock so the buttock is bigger
4685781 no he has a longer full name he has a middle name
4685782 hmmm i dont know so what is his full name
4685783 imagino una final en la que asafa saldr fant sticamente le veo liderando la carrera a los 10 metros a los 20 a los 30 y hasta los 65 y los 70 pero no creo que sea lo suficientemente fuerte ni que pueda abrir suficiente distancia para mantener lejos a gay y bolt
4685784 s que asafa ha dicho que si est primero a los 70 metros nadie le alcanzar debe decirlo cu ntas veces dije yo eso antes de que me ganara bailey s c mo se siente y no s c mo podr mantener lejos a bolt
4685785 asafa caz a bolt me dice la gente y lo que veo yo es que le cogi cinco metros de ventaja y que bolt le recuper cuatro y medio
4685786 eso ser importante quiere decir que si bolt hace la peor salida de su vida y asafa la mejor de la suya como pas en estocolmo aun as ser una carrera cerrada y no creo que mucha gente vaya a apostar en su casa a que asafa ganar a bolt en esas condiciones
4685787 por su patr n de zancadas y porque nadie pens nunca que alguien con su estatura pudiera correr esto pues le costar a arrancar luego hizo 9 72s simplemente es el que tiene m s formas de ganar puede hacerlo viniendo desde atr s y si toma la delantera todo se habr acabado
4685788 han dicho que ganar bolt no estoy seguro de que la pierna de gay aguante los que arrancan bien arrancar n bien los finalizadores les pasar n a media carrera y bolt ganar porque es el que mejor acaba s lo l puede ganarse
4685789 nada hace m s feliz al diablo que ver la poca ropa de las mujeres en las olimpiadas
4685790 cuando vengan los colegios de los ni os y las escuelas y el autob s y todas esas cosas seremos perfectamente conscientes de que hay una crisis importante
4685791 debo de estar incubando una gripe ya se sabe los aires acondicionados
4685792 normalmente a estos ritmos yo voy meando pero esta vez me he hinchado nunca me he sentido en carrera he estado sin sensaciones nada no me lo explico este deporte es as de injusto
4685793 seguir con pascua y en el 1 500 hasta el europeo de barcelona 2010
4685794 se trataba de gastar lo m nimo y me han llevado a ritmo mis objetivos eran que las piernas funcionaran y han funcionado pasar a la final y he pasado y ahora que dios me ayude
4685795 lo digo porque es que me encuentro muy bien muy bien suelo ser prudente en lo que digo pero esta vez siento algo dentro de m llego en muy buena forma
4685796 est espectacular pero eso se acaba pagando o por lo menos lo pagamos las personas normales
4685797 si hago 23 4s en el primer 50 puede que consiga abrir hueco suficiente para llegar el primero
4685798 como juvenil empec a nadar para estados unidos el relevo consegu buenos resultados pero quer a competir en pruebas individuales y en 2000 aparecieron phelps y crocker no hay nada como ellos en la competici n y si ganan oros a nadie le importa lo que phelps haga aqu en estados unidos ser olvidado la semana que viene en mi caso ganar una medalla una final para serbia ser a distinto nunca me har rico haciendo este deporte pero si quiero hacer algo positivo en serbia me lo agradecer n como en ning n lado tenemos talento para cualquier deporte el famoso talento balc nico
4685799 el que est preocupado soy yo me preocupa lo que no veo lo que esconde yo he hecho mi mejor tiempo no s si podr rebajarlo otra vez l ir m s fuerte
4685800 la carrera de ma ana por esta madrugada ser la m s importante de todas
4685801 una de las cosas que tendr que hacer es empezar los primeros 50 metros m s r pido me gustar a llegar al viraje en menos de 24 segundos hice 24 2s en la semifinal y 24 4s en la serie as fui un cuerpo por detr s y cog las olas de los contrarios cuando tengo que salir a la superficie y abrir el agua se me hace muy duro pasar a trav s de las olas hasta ahora estos tipos crocker y cavic han pasado por los 50 unas cuarenta cent simas por delante tengo que acortar la diferencia
4685802 beforehand bob his coach said it would be good for me if i lost when he said that i was fired up i said im going to go for it
4685803 when i saw the replay when i did take that extra half stroke i thought that had lost the race
4685804 but i guess when i took that half stroke that was what i needed im at a loss for words
4685805 im extremely happy i was a little nervous before the race but i think that was my best race ever
4685806 thanks but its time to put up or shut up
4685807 i just want to be able to get a good nights sleep and to live in my home without these monstrosities hovering over me
4685808 is it worth destroying families pitting neighbor against neighbor father against son
4685809 i love that im curvy but im on this major kick to try and lose weight especially in my butt
4685810 im just so over it when youre posing on the red carpet and the paparazzi shout turn around turn around it gets a little offensive
4685811 indias commitments under the current terms of the proposed arrangement do not justify making far reaching exceptions to international non proliferation rules and norms
4685812 before india is granted a waiver from the nsgs full scope safeguards standard it should join the other original nuclear weapon states by declaring it has stopped fissile material production for weapons purposes and transform its nuclear test moratorium into a meaningful legally binding commitment
4685813 if nuclear testing is to be deterred meaningful penalties must be available
4685814 if nsg states do agree to supply fuel for indias civilian nuclear sector they must avoid arrangements that would enable or encourage future nuclear testing by india
4685815 otherwise you and your government may become complicit in the facilitation of a new round of destabilizing nuclear tests
4685816 yet the arrangement would give india rights and privileges of civil nuclear trade that have been reserved only for members in good standing under the npt
4685817 it creates a dangerous distinction between good proliferators and bad proliferators and sends out misleading signals to the international community with regard to npt norms
4685818 in the absence of a suspension of fissile material production for weapons by india foreign nuclear fuel supplies would free up indias relatively limited domestic supplies to be used exclusively in its military nuclear sector thereby indirectly contributing to the potential expansion of indias nuclear arsenal
4685819 to support measures that would avert further damage to the already beleaguered global non proliferation and disarmament regime
4685820 has several important implications for the design of tax transfer programs and the welfare evaluation of taxation

4685841 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
4685842 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
4685843 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
4685844 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time
4685845 so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
4685846 i get the complaint of oh i wish i could see that
4685847 there was nowhere i could find that was just safe where maybe a slip of the finger would take us somewhere where i dont want the kids to see or hear

4685856 no queremos ser conocidos s lo por la corrupci n la ilegalidad y el narcotr fico

4685858 paraguay tiene a sus hijos en el mundo y hoy es tiempo de agradecer la hospitalidad de los pa ses que los alojan

4685866 la amenaza y la intimidaci n no son formas aceptables de conducir la pol tica externa en el siglo xxi es necesario respetar la soberan a y la integridad territorial de georgia
4685867 rusia en cuanto garante de la seguridad en el c ucaso tomar cualquier decisi n que respete sin ambig edades la voluntad de estos dos pueblos cauc sicos
4685868 el punto clave de partida de las negociaciones para solucionar el conflicto de osetia del sur y abjasia debe ser el respeto a la integridad territorial
4685869 es injusta la presencia de los militares rusos en territorio georgiano es necesario cumplir el plan de paz de la uni n europea para que las tropas rusas dejen georgia
4685870 significa que debe imponerse inmediatamente el alto el fuego y que las tropas regulares rusas tienen que abandonar el territorio georgiano
4685871 la soberan a de georgia sobre abjasia y osetia del sur es inapelable
4685872 el plan no prev un nuevo estatus pol tico de abjasia y osetia del sur pues su contexto se basa en las resoluciones del consejo de seguridad de la onu que reconocen la integridad territorial de georgia y que formalmente rusia acepta
4685873 necesitamos observadores y fuerzas internacionales imparciales en las regiones en conflicto
4685874 life is the chief cause of death do we ban life
4685875 the krv has no business to raid any place or to beat people they have beaten people with rods and taken away their mobile phones if the krv got to know of a rave party they should have informed the police they have no power to raid and arrest they are doing things like this just to create fear and extort money

4685882 goddammit ili hidi kuri hidi for heavens sakes the police have better things to do as a tax paying citizen i sure would hope that my money be spent towards
4685883 the woman was gangraped because she was provocatively dressed and she was easy meat
4685884 because the laws are slack and people with influence can get away with anything its high time to be strict and enforce the law
4685885 changing the laws in this fashion will ensure that politicians and sons of rich people will continue to snort and binge finding their way around the law whereas people without that level of influence will not have that privilege
4685886 you can listen to recorded music and you cannot listen to live music is something which is not understandable how can the police say that listening to music in a club and having a drink lead to crime this has nothing to do with the live band the attitude of the police should be questioned here
4685887 why dont you sit home and drink after the scheduled time
4685888 you are decent and will keep up certain standards but what about the rest of the drunkards who go wild in local bars and run amok the city the types like thugs uneducated

4685893 this is the start of my 23rd year i have never dealt with anything like this with a magnitude of this degree
4685894 when this happened the coach should have packed up the bus and brought the boys home and called the parents immediately
4685895 im not scared my goal is to better my personal best
4685896 in the heats there are people with a lot of experience
4685897 do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal for where your treasure is there your heart will be also

4685906 este proceso de separaci n proporciona un arma poderosa para el estudio de la estructura de una manada ya que si dos voces tienen frecuencias instant neas proporcionales podemos suponer que se trata de dos arm nicos diferentes producidos por un mismo lobo y si no las tienen pero coinciden en el tiempo podemos asegurar que las emiten individuos distintos lo que nos permite estimar el n mero m nimo de lobos que han aullado o ladrado en el coro
4685907 podemos distinguir el n mero de voces que se escuchan cuando a llan a la vez pero si no suenan simult neamente desconocemos si son emitidas por el mismo individuo o no

4685995 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4685996 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4685997 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us

4686010 when youre in a place of distress you try to glom on to someone elses solution but no one knows your life like you do
4686011 when i saw the pain in my childs eyes i realized i needed a whole new skill set to handle my new life
4686012 this was more about what we wanted to do as opposed to what our families wanted to do
4686013 the couple is a bit older and their personalities are more developed so they have more of a sense of who they are and they have a better sense of the kind of ceremony they want in the second marriage they dont have the pressures of either parents to have the wedding that the parents want a younger first time bride mom is planning the wedding and influencing the style the mature bride knows who they are and what they want

4686015 brides arent being married in the basements of their churches anymore
4686016 these weddings should be planned out six eight even 12 months ahead

4686024 without the threat of court everyone is able to think outside the box and create solutions that are unique to their situation not necessarily what a judge will do but what will work for the highest good of all involved
4686025 the wife went to a very contentious very difficult lawyer i gave my client a copy of my book collaborative divorce and he gave it to his wife she had been frightened initially after reading the book she talked to one of my colleagues she liked him better than her original lawyer we formed a team of experts my client is a very generous man and this gave him a context in which he could express his generosity

4686044 gender stereotypes trump race stereotypes in every social science test
4686045 the deal is that women generally fall into two alternatives they are seen as either nice but stupid or smart but mean
4686046 contact doesnt undermine these stereotypes and it might even strengthen them
4686047 many people dont believe seeing women as kind or soft is a stereotype theyre not going to question it because they believe its a good thing
4686048 the measure of a civilization is how it treats those who have hurt it

4686050 are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4686051 we zijn hier graag en we willen hier nog heel lang blijven maar je zult ons niet horen zeggen dat brussel de enige interessante stad van belgi is ook andere steden hebben hun kwaliteiten jammer dat het overgrote deel van de vlamingen uit de provincie niet hetzelfde denkt over brussel dat gaat zo ver dat het soms aanvoelt alsof ik iets mispeuter door mij goed te voelen in brussel
4686052 mijn moeder was van westende mijn vader was een nederlander hij is opgegroeid in een streng protestants milieu en toonde a l van jongs af een voorliefde voor grafische kunst als knaap zocht hij geregeld het gezelschap op van een glasschilder uit de buurt later ging hij in de leer bij een glazenier in den haag en volgde hij lessen aan de academie uiteindelijk is hij in brussel terechtgekomen waar hij werkte bij twee succesvolle glazeniers steyaert in schaarbeek en spreters in laken genoeg werk dus zo heeft hij onder meer de glasramen van de abdij van ter kameren gerestaureerd
4686053 mijn ouders woonden in jette in de essegemstraat schuin tegenover het huis van magritte in 1936 zijn ze naar oostende verhuisd waar ik ben geboren toch bleef mijn moeder brussel een warm hart toedragen ooit wilde ze terug
4686054 in oostende woonden we iets buiten het centrum ons huis stond alleen lang was er zelfs geen bestrating maar ik was er graag die ruimte en de nabijheid van strand en zee gaven een gevoel van vrijheid in de zomer gingen we niet zo vaak naar het strand zeker niet als pubers voor ons was de winter strandtijd zeker als het lekker stormde
4686055 voelde ik me dus goed in oostende dan kan ik dat van brugge waar ik plastische kunsten heb gestudeerd minder zeggen wat het juist is joost mag het weten maar die stad ligt me gewoon niet
4686056 niet dat hij de stad zo goed kende het ging van het werk naar zijn kamer van zijn kamer naar het werk vijf dagen per week en tijdens het weekeinde kwam hij naar huis naar bredene luc kende antwerpen zelfs beter dan de stad die hem werk verschafte toch is het brussel geworden nadat we getrouwd zijn angst boezemde het me niet in de twee jaar dat ik na mijn studie in izegem gewerkt en gewoond heb zakte ik met vrienden soms naar brussel af het was de kliek van roeselare zon beetje de provos van vlaanderen van wie er een aantal aan het rits studeerden brussel was toen misschien wel niet de plezantste stad maar wij maakten het plezant nog steeds vind ik het merkwaardig dat zoveel vlamingen bang zijn voor brussel ook in mijn familie ikzelf ben nooit bang geweest er is me ook nog nooit iets overkomen wel hebben we n keer inbrekers over de vloer gekregen maar ja een opengewaaide voordeur heeft nu eenmaal iets uitnodigends voor wie slechte bedoelingen heeft dat ik nog nooit ben lastig gevallen zal wel met uitstraling te maken hebben zeker al ga ik niet beweren dat brussel overal even veilig is er zijn wel degelijk een aantal wijken die moeilijk zijn absoluut
4686057 langs de waterloosesteenweg hier niet ver vandaan elf jaar lang hebben we er gewoond toen werd het ons wat krap twee hoog geen tuin zelfs geen terras n drie zonen sander jasper en wouter
4686058 dat we in de buurt zijn gebleven was louter toeval we hadden al zowat overal rondgekeken maar het was altijd iets te klein te duur te dit te dat tot ik op een dag naar de gb boodschappen ging doen en hier in de abdijstraat een te koop bordje zag hangen onmiddellijk getelefoneerd dezelfde dag nog komen kijken en een optie genomen drie verdiepingen en een sous sol ruimte voor een atelier en werkplaats plus een tuin geen seconde hebben we getwijfeld
4686059 het is hier altijd rustig zelfs op het spitsuur hebben we amper of geen last van het verkeer met dank aan de appartementsgebouwen van de jaren 20 van de vorige eeuw dikke muren die de hele hoek afschermen
4686060 het is hier echt zalig hierachter is een soortement hogeschool voor theologie met een parkje dat waarschijnlijk nooit zal verdwijnen je hebt hier om de hoek ook park tenbosch misschien wel het mooiste park van brussel dat was vroeger de ommuurde moestuin met serres van een van de eigendommen van solvay waar nu de indiase ambassade is op een bepaald moment is er sprake van geweest er appartementsgebouwen te zetten maar toen is heel de buurt in actie geschoten met succes we zijn nu ook aan het ijveren voor eenrichtingsverkeer in de straat afwachten wat het wordt
4686061 het park was indertijd heel wild en gelukkig hebben ze daar bij de heraanleg rekening mee gehouden zodat het niet te gecultiveerd is geworden het is echt een luxe om zon mooie groene zone vlak bij je voordeur te hebben zoiets verwacht je niet in een buurt als deze we wandelen er dan ook geregeld door op weg naar de bushalte of de stad onze jongens crosten er graag met hun fiets rond tot het helaas niet meer mocht ergens begreep ik het wel prettig was het niet dat gedoe voor de oude dametjes die er dagelijks op een bankje komen zitten
4686062 ze heet van majken tot prutske het eerste boek dat ik illustreerde was jij majken toch het laatste prutske van stijn streuvels vandaar tussen die twee ligt een periode van 21 jaar 138 boeken daarvoor was ik vooral met collages bezig bewerkt met olieverf grote afmetingen half figuratief de overstap naar illustratie kwam er door de aanwezigheid van steeds meer kinderboeken in huis die aanstekelijk werkten
4686063 ik heb het altijd graag gedaan ik werk ook nog altijd met pen en penseel in plaats van met de computer over gebrek aan werk heb ik zeker niet te klagen er is zelfs sprake van een overproductie van kinder en jeugdboeken je zou bijna zeggen dat iedere schrijver denkt kinderverhalen te kunnen schrijven ik begin er ook steeds meer over te denken het schilderen weer op te nemen maar terug naar het grotere werk is toch weer een hele stap
4686064 hier in de buurt wonen nogal wat franstalige illustratoren contact met hen heb ik niet jammer n merkwaardig want het is tenslotte een zeer klein wereldje bij de jongeren merk ik wel een mentaliteitswijziging die maakt het allemaal niet veel uit of het frans of vlaams is maar de ouderen je loopt elkaar tegen het lijf op een boekenbeurs in pakweg parijs vanwaar ben je antwoord van elsene je woont vlak bij elkaar maar om elkaar te leren kennen moet je naar parijs gaan waanzin we gaan naar duitsland naar itali naar overal en maar uitwisselen maar hier niet het zou misschien geen slecht idee zijn om een gezamenlijke tentoonstelling in brussel organiseren om de boel een beetje open te gooien gelukkig maar dat er in brussel ook sectoren zijn waar de grenzen wel vervagen het kunstenfestivaldesarts is daar een prachtig voorbeeld van de kvs en het kaaitheater doen ook hun best al hoor je dat sommigen er niet mee opgezet zijn omdat het in hun ogen niet vlaams genoeg is begrijpe wie kan
4686065 wij manifesteren ons niet echt als de bewuste vlaming we spreken onze taal de jongens zijn naar nederlandstalige scholen gegaan en daar houdt het een beetje mee op wellicht speelt mijn nederlandse afkomst daarin ik ben niet naar hier gekomen met het idee ik ga hier als vlaming in brussel wonen dat gevoel is pas gekomen toen ik hier eenmaal was en moest vaststellen tiens ze zijn hier precies tegen ons de buurt was volledig franstalig om op het gemeentehuis je identiteitskaart te krijgen verliep alles in het frans maar dat is veranderd je ne comprends pas das verleden tijd op het gemeentehuis zijn ze praktisch volledig tweetalig en als het niet gaat dan halen ze er iemand bij voor mij allemaal geen probleem hoor frans engels spaans en zelfs duits als het nodig is
4686066 ook de buurt is al een beetje vervlaamst hiernaast woont een vlaamse familie in het huis daarnaast een half vlaamse familie
4686067 enorm de evolutie die brussel heeft doorgemaakt in de vier decennia dat we hier wonen de stad was soms vuil het enige wat ze deden was afbreken afbreken en nog eens afbreken weinig blijheid zat er in brussel nu is die er wel wonen in brussel is met de jaren leuk geworden bovendien merk ik dat steeds meer jonge mensen er iets mee willen doen met die stad
4686068 toen wij hier kwamen wonen langs de waterloosesteenweg was het geen bijzonder gezellige buurt je had er wat bedrijfjes voor auto onderdelen veel garages meer niet en dan ging plots de quincaillerie dicht een leuke winkel in allerhande ijzerwaren waar je van alles kon krijgen waarna een restaurant er zijn deuren heeft geopend het eerste van vele waardoor het straatbeeld levendiger is geworden met soms een vleugje snobisme dat wel
4686069 een buurt kan weer opleven h ik denk dat het met flagey dezelfde kant zal opgaan nu het plein eindelijk in een nieuw kleedje zit al vind ik het resultaat persoonlijk een beetje koud ik heb het plein nog gekend vol met bomen met de kiosk en het frietkot daar schiet niets meer van over het is een enorme vlakte even wennen dus maar er zit iets in al die banken leuk en als de fonteinen spuiten en de glazen luifel er zal zijn dan kan het er al helemaal anders uitzien
4686070 natuurlijk zijn er dingen waarbij ik de wenkbrauwen frons de architectuur kan bijvoorbeeld zoveel beter er zijn heel weinig nieuwe gebouwen die de moeite waard zijn fantasieloze steriele glazen torens dat wel maar voor de rest als er dan toch iets moois bijkomt dan valt het dubbel op neem nu het nieuwe gebouw naast delvaux in etterbeek aan het vroegere arsenaal rode baksteen kleine ramen n met de omgeving maar tegenover verwezenlijkingen als deze staan dan weer miskleunen van je welste zoals dat operettedecor tegenover het centraal station waar vroeger zon mooie ruimte was ik heb altijd het gevoel dat die gebouwen in elkaar gaan klappen maar goed ik hoef er niet tegenaan te kijken
4686071 met de leegstand is het dan weer de goede kant aan het opgaan maar het is lange tijd huilen met de pet op geweest die panden aan de achterzijde van de munt bijvoorbeeld die er door speculatie jarenlang verwaarloosd hebben bijgelegen midden het centrum vlak bij een van de meeste prestigieuze operagebouwen van europa dat was toch schandalig en dan maar zeggen brussel het hart van europa met het flageygebouw was het eigenlijk ook zo jarenlang hebben we gevreesd en velen met ons komt dit ooit nog goed zon mooi gebouw waar zo lang niet naar omgekeken werd erg was dat gelukkig maar dat ze het gered hebben
4686072 voor de rest is er bitter weinig waaraan ik me stoor ja dat er van die grote autos rondrijden dat hoort toch niet in een stad die leefbaar wil zijn vroeger vloekten de mensen ook dikwijls op de hondenpoep maar dat is veel verminderd wij losten dat op onze manier op de jongens staken daar vlaggetjes in en het hielp nog ook globaal genomen kan het allemaal toch nog schoner maar al is brussel verre van perfect je staat er allemaal niet echt bij stil omdat je het zo gewend bent je moet er ook niet te moeilijk over doen dat nonchalante van brussel ik denk dat een buitenstaander het sterker aanvoelt dan iemand die hier al lang woont
4686073 ik ben er dol op al wandelend de blik omhoog zie je zoveel meer je ziet niet alleen alles je ruikt ook alles indertijd gingen we iedere zondag op wandel in het zoni nwoud met de kinderen zalig dat bos is een geschenk dat je er zomaar bij krijgt als je in brussel komt wonen in de zomer is het er lekker fris in de winter als het dan al eens wil sneeuwen is het fee riek ook mijn vader kwam er dikwijls toen hij nog in brussel woonde ik heb zelfs nog een heel oude kaart van hem van het zoni nwoud niet echt een stafkaart maar het lijkt erop die is echt wel goed gebruikt die hangt bijna helemaal aan flarden
4686074 ikzelf ben er voor het eerst geweest toen ik zestien was of zo we waren met de school een tentoonstelling in het psk komen bezoeken en s middags mochten we ook eens kennismaken met het zoni nwoud het was herfst de kleurenpracht sloeg ons met verstomming dat beeld is me altijd bijgebleven
4686075 health it industry leaders came to the governments defense in reaction to a report criticizing the federal governments efforts to promote health it adoption
4686076 divorce is identity jarring and it is important to step back from the old person in order for the new one to emerge
4686077 charming intelligent attractive and seemingly safe or so everyone thought
4686078 i got the house but he got the hot new wife
4686079 i was happy that he married her because in my case it was like we had grown apart
4686080 he was so upset that he came all the way to illinois to follow me
4686081 it depends on how long theyve been divorced sometimes theres other stuff going on but often jealousy everyone once theyre separated or divorced they dont like to see that person with another person we all kind of look like he belongs to us even if theyre divorced
4686082 when they have kids theyre always going to be connected to that some women stay dependant on their ex husband when they get remarried and call them up when they are newly married and i think they call them up just to upset them in the new marriage
4686083 i have called him before about it but one of the things is the kids were very angry at him for a long time they were upset because they felt that he had to choose
4686084 the first paper i ever gave on climate change was trying to disprove that increases in greenhouse gases could be causing these observed trends in temperature
4686085 i was a sceptic the starting point was that this cant be happening what we actually found was the more and more we looked the more and more agreement there was between greenhouse gas increases and warming in the lower atmosphere and cooling in the stratosphere which is the pattern under climate change
4686086 i become frustrated because there is no requirement to be truthful in an opinion piece
4686087 it is amazing to me that rather than going to csiro the national academy of sciences in the us the australian academy of sciences or other scientific organisations from around the world that are all consistently providing the same evidence a significant proportion of the federal shadow cabinet and many others in the liberal party and national party and other interest groups are collecting information not from reputable sources but from websites which may or may not be funded by a right wing lobby group or a fossil fuel company which says there is a conspiracy but im not surprised people like to hear information that confirms their underlying beliefs
4686088 if you dont believe them you really should go read what the original scientific papers say
4686089 i had this dilemma first of all when i was approached that its stupid because they are not going to listen and they dont care but then i thought about it a little more
4686090 its better to be engaged and try to do it from the inside as part of the process than to snipe from the outside and to be ignored
4686091 it is probably becoming more reasonable to say the state government is no longer burying its head in the sand but it might just be looking in the other direction when some important decisions need to be made
4686092 i am very very concerned that it will have negligible impact for the first five to 10 years
4686093 we were effectively tossing coins and finding nine out of 10 are coming up heads and thats over 29 000 coin tosses
4686094 on a scale of 1 10 how important is marketing yourself and others
4686095 dan allah tidak menjadikan pemberian bantuan kemenangan tersebut melainkan sebagai khabar gembira bagi kemenanganmu dan untuk ketenteraman hatimu kemenangan tersebut adalah pertolongan dari allah yang maha perkasa lagi maha bijaksana
4686096 dan ingatlah tatkala tuhanmu memaklumkan bahawa sesungguhnya jika kamu bersyukur di atas nikmat ku pasti akan ditambahkan lagi nikmat itu dan jika kamu mengkufurinya maka sesungguhnya azab aku tersangat pedih
4686097 golongan yang diberi kuasa untuk memerintah di muka bumi ini hendaklah mereka memperkukuhkan hubungan dengan allah mendirikan sembahyang dan menjaga kepentingan golongan bawahan menunaikan zakat dan menegakkan yang makruf membasmi yang mungkar dan berserahlah kepada allah yang kepada nya kembali segala urusan
4686098 ini adalah suatu kurnia dari tuhanku untuk menguji daku apakah aku bersyukur atau aku kufur kepada nya dan barangsiapa yang bersyukur maka sesungguhnya dia bersyukur untuk kebaikan dirinya dan barangsiapa yang kufur maka sesungguhnya tuhanku maha kaya lagi maha pemurah
4686099 dan sesungguhnya allah telah menunaikan janji nya kepada kamu ketika kamu mengalahkan musuh kamu dengan izin nya di awal perang uhud sampai kepada saat kamu lemah dan berselisih faham sama ada hendak terus mematuhi perintah rasulullah ataupun melanggarinya setelah allah menguji kamu dengan memperlihatkan kemenangan yang sementara
4686100 ive kind of accepted the house is going to look like a house with young children again until we find another solution to the problem
4686101 parents hurt when their kids hurt and when there are grandchildren involved that elevates it even more
4686102 your childs divorce what to expect what you can do
4686103 even if you dont approve of what your child has done your role as a parent is to say i support you what can i do to help you
4686104 the biggest one is collecting child support through income withholding when they get paid their child support gets paid that has literally doubled collections in the u s
4686105 if you become educated and know your legal rights you can guide your case through the system
4686106 i recommend people use the government because they now have these new tools income withholding and passport suspension and they can attach commissions and bonuses through automation you dont have to wait for a caseworker to do something
4686107 i always go into evaluating with a couple or individual that all marriages are worth working for because you wouldnt have gotten married if you hadnt had common values or goals or if it was never really good
4686108 its important that you become friends with someone before you ever marry them because when you are friends you get to know each other better before you become intimate
4686109 i married a farmer he would talk about farming i was a city girl there wasnt a relationship with that even though i wanted to learn more about that part of his life even though i tried trying was not good enough i didnt feel like we had anything in common
4686110 people in our culture are emotionally spiritually and philosophically immature ive been practicing divorce litigation since 1974 and almost without an exception all those hundreds of clients ive had theres this sense that the reason theyre wanting to get divorced is due to some level of unhappiness theyre experiencing which they project to the other person
4686111 both of them have grown but in different directions 10 years later those marriages very often were entered into the wrong reasons
4686112 those arent the strongest marriages their values and goals are not the same anymore but that didnt happen all at once it happened by ignoring the small problems for many years
4686113 i was starting to hurt for the last 10 metres
4686114 it was my last individual race and i just wanted to finish as strong as i could
4686115 he wont have to get a job ever he can live off this for 50 years
4686116 im so excited i can hear my national anthem play im so proud itll be exciting back home
4686117 if anyone would have said before the games that id win two golds and break the world record id have laughed in their face
4686118 la prima notte del dottor daniele industriale col complesso del giocattolo
4686119 some attorneys say couples stay together until the beginning of the school year while others say they wait until after graduation is over
4686120 personally i dont have a clue why people divorce at certain times of the year more than others
4686121 generally the calls fall off just before thanksgiving and pick up again on january 2
4686122 the calls tend to come in on a fairly even keel until about june 1 when vacation starts
4686123 for some divorcing in the fall prevents the children who are home during the summer from becoming more aware of fights or problems that may occur once the couple files for divorce
4686124 they think miracles will happen during the holidays especially when children are involved leving said the legal services commission recognizes january and february as the busiest months for divorce
4686125 what skills do you possess thatll help you meet the requirements of this job
4686126 play therapy is the best therapy for children because children do not communicate as well as adults by talking they use play to express themselves
4686127 this is a non threatening approach they are not asked their feelings or opinions but are expected to play
4686128 a lot of the things that they say comes from the play itself in terms of projecting feelings and thoughts
4686129 a play therapy room is a room filled with toys these toys include toys that will help address issues of children such as abuse neglect divorce school failure depression anxiety hyperactivity social skills grieving or other needs
4686130 most of the time you follow the children i dont bring up the topic when theyre kids they will take you where you need to go
4686131 a child leads the therapy sessions at their pace when they are ready to address an issue it will become a part of their play they resolve the issue in their play with the guidance of a trained play therapist and the issue disappears from their play
4686132 sometimes what is a good idea is to have them draw a house a tree and a person drawing with a pencil and getting an idea of how they see themselves view their home and surroundings and whether theyre well grounded or not if they have windows in the house to let light in those kinds of things are helpful in learning where they come from in terms of their family
4686133 another thing i ask is to draw their family and position in the family
4686134 yeah dad how bad is it to put diesel gas in the car
4686135 hello dear you know how youre always saying remember to open the garage door before you back out and we all laugh at you well i forgot to open the door the door is a mess and the back of the van is all banged up and worst of all i cant get the door to go up or down im stuck
4686136 so the pair bonding gene is weak in most mammals but not all its pretty strong in humans and stronger in general in female humans
4686137 as humans we have a broad spectrum of choices in front of us do we act like animals or do we separate ourselves from the animals for a higher role do we chose our baser urges or shun them and try to contain our actions within boundaries that are for our as a species betterment
4686138 i have heard a couple of people one i have known personally say that if africa were to accept monogamy as a social norm aids could be wiped out or at least curbed there and these are not christians or other religious missionaries they are agnostic or atheists and scientists and researchers who have been on the ground in africa studying this our behaviour whatever drives it or limits it affects our health and viability as a species
4686139 religion and morals help us decide what is acceptable and unacceptable science as a religion offers poor conflicting advice on how humans should behave this is highlighted in the contradiction between a what feels good and b what is best for us
4686140 the standard cross cultural sample describes the amount of extramarital sex by men and women in over 50 pre industrial cultures
4686141 studies have found that about 10 15 of women and 20 25 of men engage in extramarital sex
4686142 like those of the monogamous prairie vole and unlike those of the non monogamous montane voles human oxytocin receptors are located in several dopamine rich regions of the brain suggesting that oxytocin is embedded in our reward circuitry
4686143 but i think and i know you disagree or at least want the scientists opinion on it that it does hurt people maybe not that night but maybe the next morning or a few days later or when someone gets sick or when the condom breaks the emotional impact of sex is more than the immediate feeling of pleasure
4686144 i agree wholeheartedly that with financial and procreative independence monogamy begins to decline i dont like it but there it is
4686145 this behaviour is good or at least acceptable for us to engage in and but this isnt
4686146 in every divorce each partner must make a critical choice you can act out your immediate feelings and get short term emotional satisfaction or you can manage those feelings and pursue long term interests you can almost never do both
4686147 listen to medicines leaders discuss the issues that matter to you tune in on your computer or download the shows to your ipod or other mp3 player you can even so you wont miss the next episode
4686148 ok so for everybody who was standing in the rain when you get home get some vitamin c amp cuddle with someone
4686149 holidays are built around family so there are a set of traditions routines and expectations the change in those underlines the change in the family structure it sort of rubs it in
4686150 what do you want to do when you grow up starting the next chapter of your life
4686151 and so theres a loss there too depending on what the traditional celebrations were
4686152 i wonder if any holiday can live up to that
4686153 we have these ideas that the holidays will be a wonderful time
4686154 they are a special time of year but the holidays are stressful too particularly when they are a reminder of friends family a relationship a future and you are facing them by yourself the holidays are supposed to be a time of coming together and when you have just come apart you feel like you dont belong
4686155 kalau bagi kat mamat tu habislah dengan dengan saya kena pindah kat pulau ketam
4686156 cut it in half put some cheese in the middle youll love it
4686157 the problem of foods with traditional roots is that people associate them with the poor
4686158 for other people to like them its going to take some effort
4686159 psychologically divorce is the equivalent of lifting a 100 pound weight over the head
4686160 though you might dub your former partner a failed husband he could be a successful father
4686161 there is no substitute for fixed schedules everyone particularly the children needs to know what is going to happen and when
4686162 most of the young men and women from my divorced families looked a lot like their contemporaries from non divorced homes most were successfully going about the chief tasks of young adulthood establishing careers creating intimate relationships building meaningful lives for themselves
4686163 you guys arent ready to divorce isnt it worth exploring the possibility of being together do you thing help might be in order as opposed to just calling it a day
4686164 we bring an expert in to deal with whatever issues crop up
4686165 when they are coming in they like to be heard
4686166 no matter who left who not matter who was cheating on whom they want to be heard
4686167 they love to see what is really happening to people
4686168 i dont know if it is because divorce is prevalent and if you marry that desire with the need for real situations that desire might author this kind of trend
4686169 was released this month said viewers are fascinated with the kinds of relationships in distress on reality television
4686170 a lot of the dysfunction on tv is serious dysfunction
4686171 they arent showing the run of the mill were talking severe to the core seriously screwed up lives
4686172 i think people get a sense of hope it depends on the show of course sometimes we like to watch things that have nothing to do with our lives because it is a good escape
4686173 but whether we like to admit it or not people like to watch drama we dont necessarily want it in our own lives we get a little adrenaline fix from watching these shows we get a sense of self righteousness
4686174 the political will is there to change the way we do business so dramatically in this country
4686175 what you have outlined in fact is a goal that may not be achievable
4686176 should there be a surcharge on jet fuel cost for private aviation which is expanding exponentially in this country and it leaves a very large carbon footprint
4686177 utilities are having a hard time keeping up with population and demand growth building every kind of power plant they can coal natural gas wind meeting all new demand in the next few decades just with renewables would be extremely difficult and expensive doing that and replacing all current coal and gas power plants in ten years is preposterous
4686178 one of the first things that i would tell them is dont be in a hurry to get into a relationship i think thats one of the biggest problems
4686179 there is a sense of emptiness and a want to fill that void and they just miss that relationship the whole relationship idea
4686180 people are not trying to be with the person they were just with and they are going in the opposite direction
4686181 often people get angry at themselves their ex or the world
4686182 people e really need to pause and deal with their own stuff
4686183 spend some time on yourself getting to know yourself getting comfortable with yourself perhaps pursuing things you didnt have time for because of the relationship
4686184 what would it take for you to have no regrets as you are breathing your last breath
4686185 it thats reading a stack of novels at home curled up under a blanket you go for it
4686186 there is so much that can be done these days
4686187 take a class do pottery see friends deepen your relationship with your self spiritual relationships or relationships with others
4686188 so many of the people i work with are post divorce
4686189 everything in the house screams i live alone and im going to be that way forever

4686211 belize offers romance and adventure and is located only one hour and 50 minutes away from miami houston and dallas by airplane convenient flight connections are available from most u s cities
4686212 however you slice it its pathetic its perverse it makes marriage into a joke and why exactly is the patron saint of yentas and bored housewives promoting this sort of garbage are ratings getting bad
4686213 what about an open marriage is a marriage i believe a marriage is something you do to be with one person for the rest of your life
4686214 how can you say your wedding vows and then say its ok if you want to have a relationship with someone else i will be here while you do this and when you finish im not sure i understand
4686215 people usually get territorial about the people theyre sleeping with and then of course theres sexually transmitted disease
4686216 personally i dont understand why a lot of people get married
4686217 my wife and i have been married almost 10 years now she does things that are very irritating at times when shes done most things that irritate me turn out nice
4686218 and if i dont do anything it turns out nice painting the room pink for example i didnt like it didnt want to do it but it turned out nice
4686219 if she was to go out and find a boyfriend that would be another story because thats a violation of our contract we had when we spoke our vows
4686220 i dont think it trial separation always leads to divorce but its not something that i personally recommend
4686221 it appears a lot of people who get separated do get divorced because they get used to living on their own again and arent ready to share again it depends on how much people are ready to put into the relationship
4686222 if today i wanted to voluntarily worsen my situation what are all of the things that i could say or not say do or not do even think or not think to worsen my situation
4686223 id like it if you would do but i dont think youre capable
4686224 there is always something to love in anybody when you look with an eye that seeks to appreciate
4686225 it was really stressful moving with children because you dont know in advance how its going to affect their lives not knowing your way around not having the family support group there before you all these things create stress for children and their well being
4686226 not knowing whats going to happen you just try to plan for the best go to the right school live in the right town and live in a good neighborhood you try your hardest to make sure you do whats right for your kids
4686227 my experience with it is its usually its a very difficult circumstance separating a parent from kids
4686228 im seeing a guy right now whos doing terrible that the kids arent going to be in the house where they were born
4686229 the isolating of the house which happens quite a bit for financial reasons is a very different adjustment for everybody and my experience is people try very hard to not disrupt the kids lives but because of finances that often ends up happening
4686230 it always feels like a step backwards children had a house a room its where my friends are its a comfort zone so needing to move is the biggest symbol of the financial difficulties that could happen after divorce
4686231 the economic realities of the divorce kids and parents struggle with that often mom has to go back to work
4686232 its part of the overall picture of what youre going through in divorce theres so much sadness for a child whose parents are divorcing
4686233 its not always the loss of the parent or the noncustodial parent not there its the whole security blanket of the life theyre so used to it if theyre teens its the familiarity of their surroundings
4686234 ive got one situation where a mom was trying to escape a very controlling alcoholic father and going back to where her family was she moved across states its a very angry protective move on the mothers part

4686237 to have this kind of agricultural assault this activity is poisoning the parks
4686238 there is no question as i and other researchers find that boys and girls from two parent intact families perform better academically than boys and girls whose parents divorced
4686239 but i was surprised to learn that girls whose parents divorced do better in school than girls from similarly troubled families whose parents went to the brink of divorce but remained married
4686240 since in most cases mothers have primary custody there may be a mother daughter bond that forms as a result of a divorce that daughters respond to in a positive way compared to what would have happened if the parents had remained married
4686241 my research suggests that policy makers ought to be less concerned with whether or not parents legally dissolve their marriages and more concerned with helping them overcome the types of problems that cause them to contemplate divorce in the first place
4686242 unless the intervention can resolve the issues that got the family to the point of considering divorce it will result in considerably lower academic achievement for the daughters involved
4686243 there has been some research suggesting that when boys lack a male role model in the home which often happens after a divorce they may be more affected than their sisters and act up but my study shows that the effects are not permanent
4686244 the typical approach used by other studies is to compare children whose parents divorced to children in traditional two parent families
4686245 the problem is that its hard to control for the differences between these two types of families to ensure that youre not picking up all the things that cause the parents to divorce rather than the effect of the divorce itself
4686246 at the same time were seeing our national security experts saying were highly vulnerable with 70 percent of our oil coming from foreign countries the largest reserves being in the most unstable region of the world the persian gulf

4686262 a new report from the union of concerned scientists offers the most comprehensive documentation to date of how exxonmobil has adopted the tobacco industrys disinformation tactics as well as some of the same organizations and personnel to cloud the scientific understanding of climate change and delay action on the issue according to the report exxonmobil has funneled nearly 16 million between 1998 and 2005 to a network of 43 advocacy organizations that seek to confuse the public on global warming science
4686263 the consequences of climate change are very real and very negative but cheney is not convinced of that he believes not quite as much as senator james inhofe that this is a hoax but that the earth has been changing since it was formed and to say that climate change is caused by humans is incorrect

4686268 many feel that divorce is more stressful and impactful because with a death even though there is a lot of anger and sorrow and grief the remaining spouse most of the time can say that they did not cause the death their spouses death was not in their control
4686269 although all of the grief and loss stages are there additionally people have to handle with great angst that somehow they had done something differently or not done something differently it could have changed the course of the marriage

4686273 as a pastor i knew you could learn a lot about a mans character based on how he treats his family barrack is a strong man of christian faith who has been married to his wife michelle for 16 years and he is the proud father of two beautiful daughters he understands the pressure families are under and what it takes to help families thrive throughout his entire career sen obama has stood by families including his own and as president hell stand by yours
4686274 the husbands mother or father may feel they have a loyalty to their son and may be betraying him by staying friends with the wife even though they cared for her

4686280 the reality of real day to day marital obligations take hold the wife no longer agrees to the same freedoms for her husband as she did when he was her boyfriend and the husband chafes at the restrictions lamenting that she is not the same woman he lived with
4686281 girls are taught that men are not necessary as fathers except physically and men are taught as boys that they will lose their children and have to pay child support so fewer people are getting married in the first place
4686282 they vacation in groups and they get on the bandwagon and get married in groups
4686283 i am really honored by the suggestion that some have made that i consider taking a position of some kind in the next administration

4686290 addressing both the challenges and significant opportunities that humanity is facing requires significant innovation in technology business and building and we are extremely excited to hear mr gores timely exploration of the intersection of these industries
4686291 by facing and removing the danger of the climate crisis we have the opportunity to gain the moral authority and vision to vastly increase our own capacity to solve other crises that have been too long ignored we must ensure that entrepreneurs and inventors everywhere on the globe have the chance to change the world

4686304 after repeated complaints they finally installed air conditioning in the sleeping quarters however most of the equipment was so old that it didnt work
4686305 the food is the worst thing weve had the same two courses for dinner for a year sometimes there hasnt been enough for everyone those who have arrived last havent got anything to eat
4686306 we never get noodles or dumplings all we get is rice
4686307 in the end the pupils got enough to eat even if the diet was extremely monotonous
4686308 the test performance of the opening ceremony was worst of all the pupils had to remain in the stadium for 51 hours they were hardly fed there was nowhere to sleep some managed to sleep on the seats but they didnt get more than a couple of hours at most
4686309 but the organizers have promised them an olympic certificate thanking them for their effort they will not receive pay nevertheless i think that the majority will think that it was good to do what they did for the olympics and their country
4686310 the performers for chinese character parts went into the models underground at 2 p m and after getting in there they could not come out
4686311 the underground area was so hot there were 897 people there and they had to wait until they finished their performance
4686312 so altogether they had to stay there for six to seven hours and they could not even go to the toilet so they all wore nappies

4686325 elo elo lam sabact ni deus meu deus meu por que me desamparaste
4686326 o centuri o que estava em frente dele vendo que assim expirara disse verdadeiramente este homem era filho de deus
4686327 o seu aspecto estava mui desfigurado mais do que o de outro qualquer e a sua apar ncia mais do que a dos outros filhos dos homens era desprezado e o mais rejeitado entre os homens homem de dores e que sabe o que padecer e como um de quem os homens escondem o rosto era desprezado e dele n o fizemos caso
4686328 e eis que estou convosco todos os dias at consuma o do s culo
4686329 porque eu estou bem certo de que nem morte nem vida nem anjos nem principados nem cousas do presente nem do porvir nem poderes nem altura nem profundidade nem qualquer outra criatura poder separar nos do amor de deus que est em cristo jesus nosso senhor

4686332 por todo o dinheiro da europa eu n o gostaria mais de ver um ateu morrer
4686333 carregando ele mesmo em seu corpo sobre o madeiro os nossos pecados para que n s mortos aos pecados vivamos para a justi a
4686334 muitos touros me cercam fortes touros de bas me rodeiam contra mim abrem as bocas como faz o le o que despeda a e ruge derramei me como gua e todos os meus ossos se desconjuntaram meu cora o fez se como cera derreteu se me dentro de mim secou se o meu vigor como um caco de barro e a l ngua se me apega ao c u da boca assim me deitas no p da morte c es me cercam uma s cia de malfeitores me rodeia traspassaram me as m os e os p s posso contar todos os meus ossos eles me est o olhando e encarando em mim

4686337 e aquele que me enviou est comigo n o me deixou s
4686338 para que possais saber e compreender que o pai est em mim e eu estou no pai
4686339 desde esse tempo come ou jesus cristo a mostrar a seus disc pulos que lhe era necess rio seguir para jerusal m e sofrer muitas cousas dos anci os dos principais sacerdotes e dos escribas ser morto e ressuscitado no terceiro dia
4686340 mas a respeito daquele dia ou da hora ningu m sabe nem os anjos no c u nem o filho sen o somente o pai
4686341 eis o fogo e a lenha mas onde est o cordeiro para o holocausto
4686342 deus prover para si meu filho o cordeiro para o holocausto
4686343 quando der ele a sua alma como oferta pelo pecado ver a sua posteridade com o seu conhecimento justificar a muitos por isso eu lhe darei muitos como a sua parte
4686344 porque o reino dos c us semelhante a um dono de casa que saiu de madrugada para assalariar trabalhadores para a sua vinha e tendo ajustado com os trabalhadores a um den rio por dia mandou os para a vinha saindo pela terceira hora viu na pra a outros que estavam desocupados e disse lhes ide v s tamb m para a vinha e vos darei o que for justo eles foram tendo sa do outra vez perto da hora sexta e da nona procedeu da mesma forma e saindo por volta da hora und cima encontrou outros que estavam desocupados e perguntou lhes por que estivestes aqui desocupados o dia todo responderam lhe porque ningu m nos contratou ent o lhes disse ele ide tamb m v s para a vinha
4686345 logo pela manh entraram em conselho os principais sacerdotes com os anci os escribas e todo o sin drio e amarrando a jesus levaram no e o entregaram a pilatos
4686346 porque o reino dos c us semelhante a um dono de casa que saiu de madrugada para assalariar trabalhadores para a sua vinha
4686347 saindo pela terceira hora viu na pra a outros que estavam desocupados e disse lhes ide v s tamb m para a vinha e vos darei o que for justo
4686348 chegada a hora sexta houve trevas sobre toda a terra at a hora nona
4686349 tendo sa do outra vez perto da hora sexta procedeu da mesma forma
4686350 hora nona clamou jesus em alta voz elo elo lam sabact ni que quer dizer deus meu deus meu por que me desamparaste
4686351 tendo sa do outra vez perto da hora nona procedeu da mesma forma
4686352 ao cair da tarde por ser o dia da prepara o isto a v spera do s bado vindo jos de arimat ia ilustre membro do sin drio que tamb m esperava o reino de deus dirigiu se resolutamente a pilatos e pediu o corpo de jesus este baixando o corpo da cruz envolveu o em um len ol que comprara e o depositou em um t mulo que tinha sido aberto numa rocha e rolou uma pedra para a entrada do t mulo
4686353 e saindo por volta da hora und cima encontrou outros que estavam desocupados e perguntou lhes por que estivestes aqui desocupados o dia todo responderam lhe porque ningu m nos contratou ent o lhes disse ele ide tamb m v s para a vinha
4686354 ele ver o fruto do penoso trabalho de sua alma e ficar satisfeito o meu servo o justo com o seu conhecimento justificar a muitos porque as iniq idades deles levar sobre si
4686355 no dia seguinte subiu pedro ao eirado por volta da hora sexta
4686356 chegada a hora sexta houve trevas sobre toda a terra at a hora nona
4686357 e porque v s sois filhos enviou deus aos nossos cora es o esp rito de seu filho que clama aba pai
4686358 o que seria do mundo se todos fossem bem ajustados haveria um tedio sem fim
4686359 i knew in my heart he was cheating but he swore he wasnt
4686360 and its so easy to believe someone who is lying when they are telling you what you want to hear
4686361 they were all calls to a specific girl all ones from a specific girl
4686362 i printed it out and he couldnt deny it then
4686363 now that i am actually filing for divorce i want to make sure i have them
4686364 if you asked me 10 years ago how often i saw that in a case i would say not often
4686365 if you asked me now i would say often its rampant
4686366 it consumed days and days of depositions days and days of court time
4686367 i like to consider myself an expert but every case i learn something new
4686368 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4686369 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4686370 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4686371 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4686372 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4686373 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4686374 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4686375 you almost always lose contact with your parent because you dont see them as often you lose the sense of security that you previously had
4686376 children of divorce a practical guide for parents therapists attorneys and judges
4686377 you dont have to tell a young child that this is the most horrible thing thats happened
4686378 you can try to protect the child from the bad feelings that are floating around
4686379 its safe to say that divorce is no longer a major factor in presidential politics
4686380 it was a major problem for nelson rockefeller in 1964 though not his only problem
4686381 but one of the major problems rockefeller had been his recent very public divorce
4686382 any country that abandoned catholicism had to abandon marriage as a sacrament
4686383 a contract was only valid as long as both parties agreed to it
4686384 absent a huge run up in coal prices a fusion power breakthrough or some unforeseen technology it seems impossible
4686385 my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 percent of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem
4686386 challenging your 2 year old to finish college by the time she is 12
4686387 if al gores silly challenge on renewable energy was simply a trojan horse to get people talking about how to move forward on fighting climate change and addressing our long standing energy policy issues im all for that and am happy to help
4686388 its not just about being online and saying wouldnt it be great if
4686389 said chris hughes the 24 year old co founder of facebook who now directs obamas online organizing strategy
4686390 if the howard dean campaign was the wright brothers then obama was apollo 11
4686391 we knew that the internet and internet alone is not going to win elections if our people on the internet were not also organizing on the ground were not going to be effective
4686392 its about building a progressive movement in this country that has a future
4686393 they liberals are developing community and we are really not doing that
4686394 the right just doesnt get it and were missing the boat
4686395 four years ago it was pretty much the dark ages for progressives
4686396 but the new tools showed that you dont need 1 500 staffers to contact 10 000 people technology makes it all scalable and much quicker
4686397 thanks to all of the people who have made this remarkable movement possible
4686398 is bringing a great new hope that we can reclaim the birthright of this nation
4686399 only if you think that not doing so almost immediately would result in an uninhabitable planet
4686400 ive never been to strasburg railroad but im looking forward to it i heard there will be lots of other kids there our children will have fun meeting new friends
4686401 tell us about when you went there for your special day
4686402 be careful aaden remember we got rid of the high chairs last week in the garage sale to help out those less fortunate than us
4686403 jon is still sleeping he drove all night the poor guy hes really wonderful about helping out with the kids around here so im letting him sleep in until its time for us to leave
4686404 good morning honey here is your coffee just the way you like it
4686405 oh dont worry about that no need to cry over spilled juice
4686406 daddy has his face all stuck in a funny look he looks just like when we finish laughing in bed
4686407 remember those spikes in the back that poked you in the eye when you hugged me
4686408 you were thinking you had to look a certain way because you were on tv
4686409 and because i was unfairly asking you to be blonde like you were when we met im sorry i ever did that
4686410 after all that intensive therapy i now know that i am responsible for my self esteem and i can look however i want to what happened in the past stays in the past
4686411 i was hoping we wouldnt be the only ones here its always nice to be with family but its nice to meet other people too
4686412 these people are nice enough to arrange special things for us lets always be polite
4686413 i want my special boy joel to hold my hand today you be mommys big girl and well discuss that when we get home and walk with cara
4686414 this is personal family time and we think it is important to have the privacy to bathe our kids and say our prayers just the ten of us
4686415 women of divorce mothers daughters step mothers the new triangle
4686416 since women today have more choices than in the past the notion of having a child on ones own represents just one option
4686417 the more divorces that you have especially bad divorces the more difficult it is for young people to envision themselves in a happy marriage
4686418 if a woman is a positive reliable role model and establishes family rituals routines and traditions that are firm then her children will not be in that next generation of troubled children
4686419 with no legal father the child has no claim to an inheritance that would otherwise and automatically go to the child if the father dies without a will something like 70 percent of the population dont have wills
4686420 i salute the single parent who honors and nurtures the precious life of a child even if they must do so alone
4686421 betrayal is the next thing that can happen to a shaky relationship when betrayal happens to you it happens for you
4686422 you must invest in attention and maintenance from the moment you begin to love
4686423 if not for the betrayal they would have gone on and on
4686424 its a sign its a signal it can shake up a routine marriage and marriage can get very routine it needs constant attention
4686425 what are you willing to change so this doesnt happen again
4686426 you need to let the other person know how you feel
4686427 do you want to stay with someone who doesnt care how you feel
4686428 the victim role is a terrible role to show your children
4686429 while people will feel sorry for you for a time eventually theyll get tired of your sad story
4686430 youre exhausted you get sick you do stupid things you either act anger in or act anger out when you act anger in you stuff your anger you may smoke or drink or do other things that are bad for you when you act anger out you do things that can get you arrested
4686431 im in the self help business i want to see people take control of their lives i tell them to go back to school reinvent your life become something extraordinary then you become a winner and youre triumphant
4686432 you have to say im not liking how i am feeling and i am going to do something about it
4686433 if youre in a marriage where youre afraid to tell your mate what you spent or who you went to lunch with if you dont have an honest marriage with a flow of communication that is meaningful youre living a life thats a lie and youre planting the seeds for infidelity
4686434 after that deep friendship is established its that deep friendship that we take into our golden years together
4686435 the answer is not to change the cheaters behavior the answer is to change your own behavior
4686436 the best time to set up boundaries is at the beginning of a relationship
4686437 theres more pain then there is pleasure then its time to go
4686438 if you leave a cheater and youre angry youre going to bring that into every relationship you have
4686439 ini kerana pas telah lama berjuang di atas landasan islam saya pun tak faham mengapa orang umno tidak mahu menyertai pas apa yang tidak kena bagi umno tehadap pas
4686440 lagi pun muzakarah yang dimaksudkan sebelum ini hanya lahir daripada datuk seri abdullah ahmad badawi dan bukannya keputusan parti umno itu sendiri
4686441 muzakarah hanyalah kehendak perdana menteri dan bukannya umno kalaulah kita adakan muzakarah atau muqabalah tiba tiba perhimpunan agung umno tidak bersetuju presidennya tak boleh buat apa apa
4686442 saya amat menyokong sekiranya umno dan pas bubar dan kita tubuh satu parti baru dan parti tersebut hendaklah berlandaskan islam
4686443 bagi dewan ulamak kami bersetuju memberi mandat kepada pemimpin parti seperti presiden timbalan naib dan setiausaha bermuqabalah dengan umno
4686444 o que seria do mundo se todos fossem bem ajustados haveria um tedio sem fim
4686445 today former vice president al gore put forward a framework of a plan that is focused on global warming and climate issues my plan is aimed squarely at breaking the stranglehold that foreign oil has on our country and the 700 billion annual impact it has on our economy we import 70 of our oil and that number is growing larger every year vice president gores plan does not address this enormous problem it is clear that he and i have two different objectives and our plans should be viewed with that in mind
4686446 i believe that elements of any realistic plan to reduce our deadly addiction to foreign oil should encompass the following
4686447 its time for us to take responsibility for the problem weve created and act now the federal government should provide the leadership to clear the way for action and private enterprise should build the infrastructure to get it done only in that way can we recapture our energy destiny
4686448 mein freund ist gegangen seine schuhe stehen nicht mehr bei der t r

4686452 as a frequent guest in the emerson household thoreau entertained the children with magic and fun he constructed a dollhouse for the emerson girls that is on display today the following is a story about how thoreau came up with the idea of booties for the chickens so they would not destroy mrs emersons roses
4686453 it is the only time that spousal support can be denied when it would otherwise be paid
4686454 the one that sticks out most in mind is if you have documented history of abuse
4686455 the richer person would normally have to pay the poorer person support but if you can prove he is a bum and that means there has to be a documented history of abuse police coming to the house doctors reports you know a real paper trail of proof then it could result in the judge not ordering support
4686456 when the friendship interferes with your relationship at home thats an emotional affair
4686457 in an emotional affair you check out mentally from the marriage you are mentally gone because you are so busy wrapped in what this other person is doing thinking and feeling you are making decisions based on how the other person will feel about them emotional affairs are very dangerous they really are because often you dont know you are in one until it is too late
4686458 the madonna and alex rodriguez situation is a public announcement of a private situation and we are hearing one of three sides to a story we dont know if alex and madonna were having an affair of any kind but we do know that most men and women would not appreciate their mate slipping in and out of another persons home at any time let alone after midnight
4686459 money sex and kids stop fighting about the three things that can ruin your marriage
4686460 the issue is disrespect toward your wife and family you can have an innocent crush on someone and it doesnt need to become disrespectful married people especially parents need to grow up emotionally and learn self control if youre a celeb and acting in ways the paparazzi can document as out of bounds thats not respectful to your wife and family
4686461 there is some blockage already in the marriage you take each other for granted and that is where the whole thing begins
4686462 you find a connection with this other person there is a thing that happens in your head where you start to believe that this other person is so much better than your spouse in various ways when that comparison thing happens that is the moment of betrayal after a while part of you is actively withheld from your spouse and reserved only for this other person
4686463 emotional affairs are often first steps out of the existing relationship they can rob the current relationship of richness and chances for happiness
4686464 i came to realize that marital infidelity was a commonplace occurence on the sporting scene
4686465 any career that puts you in a position where you are going to have access to adoring members of the opposite sex and situations where every whim is going to be catered to in terms of sexy vacations clubs etc you are going to face temptation this is why there is so much cheating that goes on during business trips and conferences there is a sense of freedom and excess that is not normally there
4686466 one thing that i learned from the interviews is that these women are strong
4686467 if they dont know what the lifestyle is like they quickly learn and then they develop strategies to manage that ongoing stress
4686468 money power and celebrity are all aphrodisiacs they draw out temptation like months to a flame the problem is compounded because the sports figures are on the road for protracted periods often without their spouses
4686469 infidelity is any more frequent amongst athletes than it is among the general population
4686470 some athletes are used to getting a lot of adoration and attention and some have impulse control issues
4686471 the thing about celebs whether they are sports figures or not is that civilians throw themselves at them for better or for worse famous people are made to be americas royalty before they know it the celebs buy into all the adulation they get and they begin to believe their own press sports personalities in particular are body consious and their hormones drive them as well as their fans
4686472 because some professional athletes have devoted so much time and energy to their craft they can be a bit undeveloped when it comes to sustaininga mature and mongomous relationship
4686473 pro sports is an area where grown men are encouraged not to be emotionally adult its not necessary emotional maturity should make a better player not a worse one but a sports star is making money for a lot of people so they can often indulge his or her baser instincts
4686474 conservative estimates say 60 percent of married men and 40 percent of married women are unfaithful to their partners at least once in their lives and they are not all rich or famous you cannot prevent anyone from placing your mental emotional and physical health at risk if they decide they want to cheat on you but you can sit down and discuss your expectations and boundaries and have a plan for when a partner is tempted and dont kid yourself many good decent people get tempted they just dont cheat
4686475 set up some ground rules before stuff happens such as i know that you will be offered and tempted by other women etc you are certainly free to act on those impulses because i cant stop you but the first time you do i will have you move out the second time we will go to counseling and you will go to some kind of 12 step program to focus on this behavior you cant control i hope you dont have a problem with that then the key is to do what you say you will do
4686476 set boundaries and let him know if he crosses them youll leave and take his money with you
4686477 maybe sneak away and call one another or try and infuse your relationship with a bit of excess such as a night out at a club or a naughty night in once in a while so certain things dont seem like once in a lifetime opportunities
4686478 regardless of what is being offered and by whom there is never an excuse to betray your partner
4686479 if youre so tempted youre losing sleep i would highly suggest seeking out a good therapist to work on your issues because its not about your partner
4686480 but there are plenty of temptations in all walks of life to stray or not depends on four things your personal self respect the respect you have for your mate the boundaries you set and the way you communicate your expectations
4686481 if you are tempted put yourself in your mates shoes how does that feel
4686482 i have never seen an opportunity for the country like the one thats emerging now
4686483 at the least the have a lot of hatred of anybody who is enjoying life
4686484 what a way to begin parenthood each of the couple is still married to different partners that means they must still navigate the legal and emotional wranglings of former spouses and in the mans case a child that can be exhausting and debilitating
4686485 the couple connected under the stress and duress of war time most difficult is that when they return home they might not even know each other how do two people who came together to assuage the horrors of war create consistent and supportive parenting this will probably be laras most difficult assignment yet
4686486 i have counseled judges surgeons attorneys actors writers and many visible and highly accomplished people when emotions sex children parenthood and intimacy are involved many people make impulsive irrational and damaging decisions
4686487 nobody likes to read about themselves like that especially the way its been sensationalized
4686488 i hated it but im just going to rise above it and keep going
4686489 its a very public airing of the marital dirty laundry its humiliating its embarassing
4686490 to have the other woman pregnant it complicates it even more
4686491 some states take fault into account in their financial awards
4686492 television and other visual media have elevated many working journalists to almost celebrity status in the publics mind for logan to risk putting herself in the middle of a media circus thanks to her extramarital affair her pending divorce and that of her beaus as well the unexpected stork arrival was a bit reckless and didnt show much foresight in terms of her career and position
4686493 end the current marriage before you let an affair dictate your next step
4686494 and whatever you do try not to babymake with the new guy until you are divorced it makes for an awkward story to tell the little one
4686495 money sex and kids stop fighting about the three things that can ruin your marriage
4686496 keep your personal life to yourself that will make it much easier to leave your divorce stress out of the office
4686497 its too expensive to talk to your attorney and you need somewhere to blow off the steam
4686498 as a counselor i have lawyers who refer divorcing clients to me i can help them calm down stop them from acting out which has severe repercussions in divorce and help them decide how to talk to the mediator the judge their family members and in laws and their children about the situation
4686499 when you get in your car at home shut the car door on the divorce give yourself that drive time to escape the divorce problems
4686500 you dont want to miss any more work than you have to the good news is you may not have to
4686501 judges recognize that people need to work in fact money is generally the main issue in a divorce if there is a legitimate reason to put the case on the 3 p m calendar as opposed to the 9 30 a m calendar a judge is likely to do so if your case is on the 9 30 a m calendar it is very likely that there are lots of other cases on at the same time so it may take hours to have your case called when you are on the 3 p m calendar your case may be the only one on so you could be in and out
4686502 if child custody is disputed it is not uncommon for a litigant to have to meet with the childs attorney and or court appointed expert again it never hurts to ask for appointments convenient to your work schedule if you ask for an evening appointment it is possible you will get one
4686503 the current model isnt as effective as it could be
4686504 we can even do better with a more holistic approach to treatment that gets to the root of the problem which may be different in individual cases treatment should be individualized not one size fits all
4686505 it shows you how the person who is perpetrator uses economic control control over the women power plays to get at the woman and so almost all the batterer intervention programs are based on this
4686506 if you look at surveys you will see that our society does not share the belief that its ok to beat up your wife
4686507 our model for prevention is a harm reduction model which is based on research on treatment intervention effectiveness and the effectiveness of practical steps that can be taken when a break up the most dangerous time for homicide is planned or has been carried out
4686508 interviews with wives who were almost murdered indicated three fourths had alcohol and other drug problems
4686509 marriage provides continuity and it gives you another person to share life events with
4686510 and someone to give your day to day struggles meaning
4686511 people like the feeling of the safety and security that comes along with a lifetime commitment
4686512 it becomes a part of something that is socially sanctioned socially encouraged
4686513 one of the most socially sanctioned ways to do that is in a marital relationship
4686514 after divorce people may look at the experience as something that failed but they dont give up on that goal to be married
4686515 if it failed they might think maybe we werent compatible but i am not incompatible with marriage
4686516 and marriage has always been a way to achieve that
4686517 regardless of the trouble people miss companionship they miss having someone to settle in with some to be with at night
4686518 we are social beings we are social animals and we need that companionship
4686519 i know that weve got more coming i know we do but its nice to be the first one
4686520 i was a little bit heavy on my feet but i kept wrestling just like my coaches always tell me to do keep wrestling no matter whats going on and whoever stops wrestling first is the one wholl be done
4686521 theyre both very proud of me they both grew up in vietnam theyre both proud of where they came from and theyre both proud to be canadian too of course
4686522 so for them to be able to come here to china to watch me wrestle at the olympic games
4686523 i am a photographer because i have a choice you are an office employee because you dont im pretty sure too you cant afford photography equipment
4686524 expensive enough all your kids will go without food and milk for two years minimum
4686525 consider not looking down on people im sure you wont be happy if i tell you that you are just a corporate slave who cant even afford a small high end digital camera or even if you can you still have to ask all the gods to give you some talents
4686526 as the ceremony got under way with a dramatic drummed countdown viewers watching at home and on giant screens inside the birds nest national stadium watched as a series of giant footprints outlined in fireworks processed gloriously above the city from tiananmen square
4686527 what they did not realize was that what they were watching was in fact computer graphics meticulously created over a period of months and inserted into the coverage electronically at exactly the right moment
4686528 as a result only the last footprint visible from the camera stands inside the birds nest was captured on film
4686529 i wish our govt would do more for the society

4686531 this engine is tuned to maximize the increased torque to improve performance where the driver needs it most in standing acceleration and passing
4686532 to help manage the extra torque the lincoln mkss six speed automatic transmission is equipped with a stiffer torque converter that delivers an immediate throttle response and a more connected feel
4686533 divorce almost always wreaks havoc with the credit reports and credit scores of both spouses
4686534 the damage bleeds over into the childs application process because lenders will pull both credit reports if the child is applying jointly with a parent
4686535 money sex and kids stop fighting about the three things that can ruin your marriage
4686536 if parents keep their childs welfare in mind and make it clear to their lawyers that the childs college education money is important they can mitigate the problems
4686537 if the child lives with the higher income parent the child may not qualify for financial aid for example even if the child would have qualified had he or she lived with the lower income non custodial parent
4686538 in situations such as these the childs primary residence matters a great deal
4686539 for example public institutions usually use whats called a federal formula for financial aid
4686540 with the federal formula they usually look mainly at the custodial parents income and assets
4686541 what will impede the custodial parents ability to qualify for more is that a parent does have to factor in child support if any as part of his or her income
4686542 child support usually extends to at least adult age meaning 18 years but sometimes depending on the divorce settlement it might extend to years after that like up through college
4686543 and the schools really look over these applications with a fine tooth comb
4686544 this one really drills into what the familys finances are
4686545 if the child is applying on their own then its a non issue
4686546 financial problems among couples are one of the main reasons for divorce in this country today
4686547 these days escalating mortgage payments are exacerbating the divorce problem
4686548 some couples will remain together to avoid the economic pressures of the recession
4686549 even in a down economy the statistics from the clerk of courts offices still report that tens of thousands of couples in southeast florida are filing for divorce each year that is a lot of divorces
4686550 in fact an argument can be made that modification actions increase when the economy is doing poorly
4686551 when california went through a prolonged recession in 1990 to 1994 we saw the number of divorces go down dramatically
4686552 couples put aside their differences and hunkered down to fight to survive the recession together hardly the incidence of domestic violence went up considerably the dv domestic violence cases were always heard at 8 30 am so the judges could be in court by 9 am for their regular calendar during the early 90s often court wouldnt start until 10 am there were so many dv cases to be dealt with each day
4686553 what i see in this current downswing is that people going through divorce are in a do it yourself mode downloading forms from the internet reading books on divorce and working with mediators and therapists instead of going the adversarial route
4686554 what i see these days is people are putting off the finalization of the divorce until the housing market gets better or if one of them has become unemployed until he she gets a job they must stay in the same house because they cant afford the expense of two houses or cant buy another house until this one sells
4686555 there are still are many couples who are in marginal marriages who do not care if they can afford to get divorced they are fed up with their relationship and want out no matter what the circumstances
4686556 has the divorce rate dropped amongst the super wealthy i doubt it
4686557 at what point do you say theres something wrong with our relationship
4686558 he seems to be bunting in his relationships not putting his best effort into recognizing a true soul mate as opposed to her skin deep assets or her notoriety if he wants to be in the game for the long term hell need to be a homerun hitter that means a relationship that goes the distance
4686559 if your mate has cheataholic tendencies if he needs constant attention needs to feel constantly admired and adored theres nothing you will be able to do to make that relationship work
4686560 if you find somebody who is unable to be alone that tells you that youre just filling a void
4686561 from the publics point of view it seems both of them having wandering eyes
4686562 c rod is trying to claim shes entitled to things that go beyond the prenuptial agreement
4686563 he needs to cover home base better all good baseball players know home is the most important base to cover but for a long time now a rod has been way out in left field hanging with other women ignoring the wife and their new baby no one stole home base he gave it away no hits no runs major errors
4686564 he was living in her shadow when a partner is living in someone elses shadow the relationship doesnt have a chance in hell
4686565 they may not know the details but they know something
4686566 did he really think nobody would notice he was cheating on his wife a wife thats so well known i think there was some part of him that wanted to get caught
4686567 peter cook has done everything wrong he could do his addiction to pornography makes him a laughing stock to the world using a web cam to focus on yourself masturbating is as creepy as it gets
4686568 i think daddy has fallen out of love with me
4686569 i always come from the journalistic perspective to protect the publics right to information but that right has to be tempered by the question the right to know what
4686570 to my mind the details behind the breakdown of a marriage are not covered under that right and serve no functional purpose
4686571 to embarrass her soon to be ex husband and publicly force him to ante up for his philandering deeds
4686572 the problem is that he is the father of their children and even if he is the biggest louse this side of the pacific the kids dont need to hear or read about it in the mainstream media i fear that brinkley has made a crucial tactical mistake and her kids will sadly pay for it
4686573 you should always be emotionally aware of everything going on between you and your spouse
4686574 this is particularly important if you have settled into a routine in your marriage
4686575 take into consideration what types of information they disclose about their divorce to friends in the community and family because these types of details can come back to haunt you in the long run
4686576 children should never hear this its not fair to them you can understand why she wants to get him back but at what price
4686577 being reared in a family where the father betrayed the vow to the wife and kids
4686578 the mother betrayed the vow to protect and prepare children for the best life possible by airing all the scandal
4686579 you have to remember what got you to this situation so you dont get into the same situation again the forgiveness is for yourself
4686580 perhaps one of the lessons for this woman is to develop depth behind superficiality shes a gorgeous woman but that only goes so far
4686581 telah difirmankan juga siapa yang menceraikan isterinya harus memberikan surat cerai kepadanya tetapi aku berkata kepadamu setiap orang yang menceraikan isterinya kecuali karena zinah ia menjadikan isterinya berzinah dan siapa yang kawin dengan perempuan yang diceraikan ia berbuat zinah

4686584 for everything god created is good and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving
4686585 you know those many hours youve played to get better at the game well fuck you and fuck skill
4686586 hello my name is elane it has been 412 days since my last well you know
4686587 i think that people like this topic because its considered taboo and exciting the idea of an outside element to your routine whether it be alone or with a partner is a bit naughty on the fringe as it were
4686588 sex is one of if not the most popular and controversial topic in the world sexuality and anything related to it has been villified and shamed for centuries which has made many view sexuality a guilty pleasure instead of a necessary healthy and normal aspect of the human experience
4686589 forums and blogs which allow people to discuss their fears worries desires hopes dreams anxieties and limitations freely without the worry of rejection or being forced to wear a scarlet letter are extremely helpful tools in my opinion
4686590 when someone finally has the courage to say what many feel but are too afraid ashamed or shy to express there is often a sense of safety created for the rest of us to be a little more authentic about who we really are under the surface as long as the members of the online community are respectful of one another and keep the conversation productive there are many positives to be found by joining an online roundtable discussion
4686591 sex and lack of a big topic during divorce even people who had bad sex in marriage have feelings on the sex subject for me going without sex is just as hard to deal with as the loneliness i was confused hurt and insecure could i ever have good sex again with my newfound emotional baggage could i give a woman sexual pleasure again i think we all need an outlet for our sexual frustration as much as we need an outlet for our anger and depression sex toys are a way for dealing with that
4686592 as presents upon divorces and breakups of my girlfriends it really is a safe way to explore your sexuality when theres no man partner or emotional attachment involved the only attachment you want sometimes is of a man made variety you dont always need to be held sometimes you want to put your date in the drawer when youre done
4686593 in reading the posts i found names for devices i never knew existed im a guy i always thought single function single purpose but thats not the case its a whole new world and like little alice were curious about what really is out there in wonderland
4686594 domestic violence prevention services seem to be protecting more men than women in providing an escape route for the women
4686595 in 1976 1304 males were murdered by their wives or partners and 1587 females were killed
4686596 in 2005 that number dropped to only 329 men were killed and 1181 females
4686597 its often difficult to immediately determine who is a victim of child abuse and who is a victim of parental wars
4686598 people get angry and tend to kill people they know and love
4686599 it could be argued that divorced parents are under lots of stress but that same argument can be made for married parents for a variety of reasons from substance abuse to financial problems and mental illnesses or any combination
4686600 but not every trauma experienced by one person is as traumatic to someone else people handle things differently so it is important to consider how a person perceives the stress and how equipped they are at coping with it in assessing the risk
4686601 if you or your ex has blown up and lost control with your kid even just once thats a clue you need help
4686602 most people are the same day in and day out even though they have changes in mood they act in a certain predictable way that is their baseline
4686603 if you your ex or another primary caregiver for your child begins acting in ways that does not fit their baseline behaviors then it is time to be cautious
4686604 if you feel your feelings moods and or actions are way off your baseline then pause and figure out whats going on and then deal with it go for counseling and get a professional assessment before you take action on other issues
4686605 divorce is too close to home for you to be an impartial interrogator
4686606 your questions are more likely to be leading than fair
4686607 the child isnt being manipulative normally children desperately want to please their parents and will answer your questions according to what they think you want to hear
4686608 even refusing to go visit or talk to the other parent doesnt necessarily mean anything is amiss most of the time it means the kid is angry over the divorce blaming one parent or trying to please the parent they are with at the moment which is all pretty normal
4686609 if your child is showing symptoms of problems such as depression withdrawal irritable mood difficulty sleeping changes in appetite changes in behavior or friends then seek counseling to determine the nature and the cause of the problem
4686610 a professional can sort out what is and is not happening to your child
4686611 if you perceive an immediate threat to your child then call the police or child protective services they can investigate and take immediate action
4686612 child help has all masters level child counselors working the phones 24 7 they can listen to your concerns and guide you from there
4686613 sometimes children are not comfortable discussing one parent to the other when one or both are obviously upset from the divorce so they can call the hotline and talk about things privately which can calm them or get them the help they need whichever is the case
4686614 as for shared parenting over the holidays the most important thing is to keep the kids interests in mind
4686615 that may mean spending time with your ex if you get along well enough sharing your kids with your ex so they get to be with both parents over the holidays or simply agreeing to let your kids spend the holiday with your ex for their sake
4686616 july 4th should be a holiday set out in your parenting plan if its not you need to follow your regular schedule unless you can come to another agreement
4686617 the 4th of july like any holiday can bring up painful memories of happier times especially if you have children
4686618 with the pain comes a choice you can acknowledge the past for what it was and value the good times you might have had together and then let go or you can torment yourself with the shoulds we should still be a family today he should be ashamed of what hes doing to us i should be over this by now it should be easier for me to move on but it isnt you get the idea
4686619 what do i want my childrens memory to be about their childhood
4686620 most adults see july 4th as a minor holiday but to kids its a big deal fireworks are exciting as is staying up late to see them so dont minimize the importance of the day
4686621 holidays will continue to be an annual event let go of anger and resentment as you find meaning in the new life you are building with your children make an effort to get caught up in the pleasure of this wonderful moment
4686622 the holidays are supposed to be a time of coming together and when you have just come apart you feel like you dont belong
4686623 as hard as it may be have a conversation about the holidays with the other parent children need the structure and security of knowing where they are going and when remember it is the child who suffers in the long run
4686624 everyone has unique needs when it comes to life insurance after a divorce someones needs and the needs of their beneficiaries such as their kids will change based on their divorce settlement the divorce decree might stipulate which parent needs to maintain life insurance and what level of benefits is required this might be something your attorney should negotiate for during the divorce process
4686625 the process for changing the beneficiary related to a life insurance policy is very simple call the insurance company and request the appropriate form once the form is signed and returned the change to the policys listed beneficiaries will be finalized
4686626 if the beneficiary is a child a trust should probably be set up
4686627 everyone should have life insurance there are different types of life insurance that service different purposes term policies for example are exclusively for protection whole life insurance policies offer protection and financial accumulation you need to sit down with an insurance expert and understand what your needs are if youre acquiring life insurance for protection you need to know what youre protecting and why
4686628 we have found that women tend to be underinsured when it comes to life insurance people seldom consider all of the costs associated with caring for and raising young children thinking about ones own death is sometimes difficult but life insurance is really about protecting your loved ones and providing what your beneficiaries might need should you not be there for them
4686629 life insurance should be part of someones total financial plan
4686630 not in favour of traditional marriage and i pray that we wont get stuck with him
4686631 your divorce rate increases approximately four percent if you have a daughter as a first child instead of a son
4686632 we dont know what the effects of having multiple girls might be we did compare families who had two daughters with families that had two sons what we discovered was that a couple with two daughters is more likely to have a third child trying to have a son
4686633 we dont believe there is any difference between races but its hard to compare divorce rates across races
4686634 women whose first child is a boy are four percent more likely to remain married than those whose first child is a girl in general the better the womans education the later the fertility the lower the divorce rate
4686635 overall a first born daughter is significantly less likely to be living with their father compared to a first born son
4686636 i dont think the people of the city of detroit should be represented by a person wearing prison clothes or wearing a tether
4686637 the focus of our convention should be on barack obama and how the party intends to get america back on track not on a distraction involving the troubles of one individual
4686638 the nomination of senator obama at the democratic national convention will be a historic event however im focused on running the city and i dont want anything to distract from that extraordinary moment
4686639 the focus should remain on uniting the party and leading our great nation in a different direction
4686640 thats up to him in terms of all the things he has to deal with
4686641 hes a credentialed delegate and hes entitled to be there
4686642 i want to first acknowledge your great mayor kwame kilpatrick
4686643 thats not the kind of change the american people are hoping for
4686644 apabila mereka bertiga maka seseorang di antara mereka hendaklah mengimami mereka

4686646 unconventional denver is an autonomous chapter of unconventional action a network of anarchists and anti authoritarians organizing against the political conventions happening this summer
4686647 dnc disruption 08 is an online clearinghouse for radical and progressive groups organizing against the democratic national convention
4686648 im elated ultimately we knew the judge was going to come to this conclusion when youre a police officer and your job is to fight crime when youre sitting the defendants seat thats a difficult seat to be in
4686649 is there a way to make the feature work on an entire project or solution
4686650 when people are displaced due to armed conflict they feel they are still not safe in their homes so as expected they would rather stay in evacuation sites
4686651 our assistance is not enough and we are aware of that
4686652 aside from food and medical assistance these people obviously need psychological intervention
4686653 at night we can still hear gunshots an indication the rebels are still there not far from baliki
4686654 we assure our people that the military will stay as long as the threats from moro rebels remain
4686655 i was scared i didnt have a ton of money and i didnt know how i was going to pay for an attorney i didnt even know how much an attorney was going to cost me the whole process was just devastating
4686656 i didnt know where i was going to get the money but it seemed like the best option at the time
4686657 if the parties are willing to negotiate compromise and agree the costs can be reasonable if they decide to litigate the costs can be considerable
4686658 keep emotions in check and work toward a respectful settlement to avoid litigation
4686659 that is all separate and the client is responsible for that
4686660 i just wanted to get it over with and thats not how i should have gone about it
4686661 the truth is i lost out my daughter lost out all because i was scared of those legal fees
4686662 if you want rape to be legal then dont vote
4686663 bush failed to secure nearly 400 tons of known deadly explosives in iraq and now they may fall into the wrong hands to be used to blow up airplanes level buildings and detonate nuclear weapons
4686664 but hey whatever ive got all your cell phone numbers now anyway
4686665 born again christians are more likely than others to experience a divorce even more disturbing perhaps is that when those individuals experience a divorce many of them feel their community of faith provides rejection rather than support and healing
4686666 not everyone professing membership in an evangelical church is necessarily a person born again you would have to determine if they were born again many people are members of a church but are not born again this issue is conversion not simply church membership
4686667 ive never seen divorce statistics arranged around comparative religions the general finding is people who are faithful members of their religion who marry someone of the same faith tend to have a lower divorce rate than others
4686668 the findings by the barna group that evangelicals have a higher divorce rate doesnt distinguish strongly faithful evangelicals from others
4686669 and it also doesnt distinguish levels of education the big factor in divorce is a persons level of education the higher the level of education the lower the divorce rate thats one reason atheists have one of the lowest divorce rates atheists tend to be well educated
4686670 i would distrust the barna report for various reasons we academics have various questions about their methods both response rates of polls and how they categorize various groups and types they do not report all the info wed normally like to see telling about possible non response bases and they seem to have biased ways of defining and categorizing at least some groups evangelicals tend to gobble up their findings uncritically
4686671 its all about what we call selection that is only those who get married are at risk of divorcing and middle america and people in the south continue to marry at rates above those in the west and northeast so when you talk about geography and divorce you have to also think about geography and marriage
4686672 when people talk about evangelicals or catholics we often make the assumption that these are regular church or mass attendees
4686673 im also surprised about the jewish number found in the barna group study but here again it likely reflects the high number of reformed jews in the u s many of whom dont practice lots of jewish traditions
4686674 age at marriage is the number one predictor of divorce couples who marry at 18 or 19 years old dont know what theyre doing and lack the social skills we once had for making marriage work many who marry young have marriages that dont make it
4686675 typical of criticism we get all the time from the public we use the american association of public researchs standards like most everyone else in the business
4686676 help church leaders and officials in government agencies if things on the divorce front is getting better or worse if you dont have this kind of tracking information you dont know if our culture is improving
4686677 i wish i had having a safety net or money set aside is smart to do
4686678 theres an old saying love is grand divorce is twenty grand
4686679 the best time to get divorced is when you have nothing no kids no property he takes the cd player she takes the tv and they drive away in their leased car
4686680 can run anywhere from 1 820 uncontested divorce to hundreds of thousands of dollars theres always britney spears who paid over 1 million to her attorneys for her custody case
4686681 thethe average cost to litigate a contested divorce in california is 45 000 per side ive seen more women break down and cry in my office after hearing my fee structure than i can count the men generally control the finances and use that power to try and squeeze the women financially many say theyd rather give it to a lawyer to teach the wife a lesson than hand it to her
4686682 couples divorcing in this market should really consider ways to cut costs mediation can reduce costs in some situations do your research
4686683 i knew they already loved him and he loved them
4686684 although you may be happy for your new marriage your kids may not be
4686685 it takes a very unselfish child to welcome this new person just because his or her parent is happy
4686686 you have to understand that children go through different developmental stages and they move at different rates
4686687 your childs divorce what to expect what you can do
4686688 so while the categories are approximate you can more or less expect there will be some pattern of behavior in each of these different stages
4686689 mom theres a man in the kitchen and hes wearing your robe the single mothers guide to dating well without parenting poorly
4686690 dating for dads the single fathers guide to dating well without parenting poorly
4686691 but your child needs to know that just for now this is the person that you want to get to know better
4686692 with your childs permission you may begin to bring this person to athletic and school events
4686693 you may also include the new person in more intimate family events such as a family trip or thanksgiving dinner
4686694 children at a very young age are clingy to the nurturing parent so in a sense you have to introduce that other person so the child seems comfortable and doesnt see that person as a stranger
4686695 imagine a world where technology helps solve the toughest problems facing us today
4686696 divorce is such an unsettling situation and the worst thing about a life changing event is just being told it is going to happen rather than being given a warning or being allowed any input
4686697 it makes you feel like you are just being thrown around as a kid i think its really important especially when your world is in such turmoil to be given a voice and to be listened to
4686698 the book is really supposed to be a quick handbook for making the most out of divorce and making it so that its the least of your problems
4686699 one of my earliest frustrations was just feeling like i was out of the loop
4686700 all these huge changes were taking place and totally adjusting my life in every respect but i wouldnt hear about it until it was actually happening
4686701 but if theyre having a discussion about your schedule you have the right to know and to make your voice heard
4686702 as early as it was appropriate i tried to let max be the one who made a fair balance around time with parent issues which until he was fully in charge had been fairly contentious
4686703 in many ways his book arose out of the power he was given to discover what worked best for him as he grew up
4686704 id honestly say that my parents divorce is one of the best things to ever happen to me in my entire life thats the good news
4686705 on the other hand divorce can make you wake up one morning realizing how much everything sucks
4686706 he says divorce is not easy but he is a survivor and has much to say about the bright side that can appear
4686707 the best thing i think about stepparents is that on one hand you know they have to be authority figures because they are still parents
4686708 but they also dont have to be parents all of the time they can be friends and you can have a kind of relationship that can maybe be a lot more relaxed than the one you have with your parent
4686709 i was very lucky to always have that i know that not all kids are so lucky
4686710 i know that sounds like a clich thing to say
4686711 but so much of the frustration that comes with divorce parental relationships or relationships in general is from miscommunication or assumptions about communication and its so important to just say whats going on to really make it clear and have that back and forth communication between two people
4686712 now that your significant other is not there and your darling daughter or special son is willing to take on those babysitting duties or to begin the meal stop right there before you head down a road to trouble it is perfectly okay to ask an occasional favor from your children but dont make the mistake of using them for your support system
4686713 children will have issues after a divorce and they must go through a readjustment phase just as you are when you ask them to take on responsibilities that they are not prepared for their first thought is that they must pitch in to help and they cant disappoint you
4686714 you come home late and a hot meal is so appealing remember your childs role is to be a child who is now growing up in a newly divorced household they must learn how to adjust to their grief about the situation make new friends if a move is eminent and care for their educational social and family needs you should be the one offering the support to them
4686715 instead of insisting on dinner being ready when you come home pick up a dinner on your way home if babysitting is a problem there are now centers that you can use to drop off a child for a couple of hours use this time to discover new survival tactics so that your life becomes easier to manage additionally by taking on these new tasks you are discovering how strong you can become which will help you in your healing process
4686716 you can have them help with small chores and occasional projects just remember that they will also need some tender care to help the healing process so try new things and explore different traditions a fresh outlook on life for all makes the trauma much less daunting
4686717 forcing kids to become the other parent after a divorce is one of the big errors parents make that is often overlooked in divorce discussions
4686718 confiding in them about adult matters asking them to spy on your ex and report back to you and giving your children adult responsibilities all burden your children emotionally psychologically as well as physically
4686719 your child takes on roles your spouse used to perform because you cant afford to hire an adult when children have to give up activities with friends sports school etc so they can take care of younger siblings clean the house and in other ways be the surrogate parent there is usually an emotional price to pay parents need to understand this and weigh it heavily when making post divorce decisions
4686720 these children miss out on their childhood and on forming healthy peer friendships because theyre too busy managing adult matters
4686721 this can result in the child becoming stuck in a particular developmental age unable to be self sufficient while their peers mature and experience age appropriate events around them
4686722 or it can lead to the child growing up too quickly and ultimately regressing back to a childhood state acting reckless and irresponsible once the child reaches adlthood oftentimes these children have a need to be perfect and are unwilling to take chances or make mistakes or they feel so overwhelmed empty and unfulfilled that they become depressed withdrawn or anxious
4686723 i think that a lot of people feel dissatisfied with their attorneys its a common problem and one i think stems from a lack of communication
4686724 if you are unhappy with your attorney talk to him or her if you dont like the way your attorney is handling the case say something dont just keep your mouth shut and fume express your concerns and see if they can be worked out one big complaint people have is that their attorney does not return their call when you leave a message say why you are calling or what it is you need a message just to call you will likely be ignored but a message that says my ex hasnt paid me child support in three weeks and can you do something will get a response
4686725 people need to remember that their divorce attorney is not their friend and that they have a business the purpose of which is to make money
4686726 never make a phone call that isnt followed up with a written note beginning to recap our conversation of such and such date where you stated you would commence discovery file a motion for contempt etc
4686727 this will be useful later in both tracking requests and deciding whether or not the attorney is doing his or her job
4686728 first of all its going to end up costing you more since the new attorney will need time to get up to speed so you will essentially pay twice for some things
4686729 also it is not entirely up to you if you can change attorneys your attorney has to get permission from the court to withdraw from the case if the court believes a new attorney will cause unnecessary delays permission might not be granted
4686730 the best resource for finding good lawyers is other people who have gone through the experience
4686731 where do you find recommendations contact local organizations such as the ymca womens resource centers catholic charities or jewish family services ask them if they offer divorce support groups and if they have the names of lawyers who have been highly recommended in the past make an appointment with these recommended attorneys most attorneys will give you free 10 minutes of their time
4686732 eighty five percent of people should divorce with little or no lawyer involvement other than the mediator they work with fifteen percent of the population is high conflict and want to fight so they will make some lucky shark divorce lawyer rich but the rest of couples need to avoid divorce attorneys if they want to keep their home and maintain any kind of viable co parenting relationship
4686733 how it feels to have a gay or lesbian parent
4686734 with all the kids i talked with the divorce was the greater issue not the parents sexual orientation
4686735 the first wave involves the gay or lesbian spouse coming out the second wave is when the straight spouse deals with the situation which can take some time and the third wave involves telling the kids so the family is dealing with the issue at different times and from different perspectives which makes it very complicated
4686736 but that is all the information that needs to be said when they are first told
4686737 at that time parents need to say that they are open to any questions the children may have whenever they want to ask them its important to not make the homosexuality a big deal
4686738 the worst thing that could happen is that nothing is ever explained to the kids
4686739 kids are affected by the family breakup more than the fact that their dad is gay or mom is a lesbian
4686740 however those in middle school or above are affected by antigay attitudes then its their turn to go into the closet adolescents have the hardest time dealing with their parents disclosure since they too are going through sexuality changes
4686741 if one or both parties are still feeling angry bitter guilty or hurt they will be unable emotionally to fully invest in the new relationship
4686742 part of achieving that closure is to remember that there were two of you in your previous marriage and own the fact that the dissolution of a marriage is rarely 100 percent caused by just one partner
4686743 exactly how do they feel they failed in the first marriage getting past the initial honeymoon period to really know how they each deal with real life issues together is key to preventing failure
4686744 in addition taking time to really feel in ones gut how this partner is different from the previous one can be reassuring if this partner does not feel different then possibly some individual or premarital counseling can be helpful

4686754 back in the day john mccain was the sort of politician who would stand first in line to call out this sort of swill
4686755 john briefly compromised his principles to support flying the confederate flag and he paid a steep personal price and deeply regretted that he could have been tempted from the path of righteousness
4686756 as a clarification i should say that i said i like mccain hes a good guy who for the most part has been decent over the years

4686801 there now you look just like your grandpappy used to
4686802 it was just too painful to consider i was too vulnerable and yes im glad i waited until i was more open and less judgmental
4686803 katie was only five when we broke up and truly worshipped her father
4686804 he had no interest in competing for my affections not that he ever could seeing her reaction made me consider giving up dating altogether
4686805 already they are upset and confused as to their own feelings in regard to their parents new situation not to mention their roles in it seeing their parent with a new partner terminates any hope they may have that their parents will eventually get back together
4686806 sometimes divorced parents will rush the process of commitment they strive to recreate the life they once had and are seeking comfort and the need to have someone in their lives again unfortunately that desire may obscure their ability to see clearly
4686807 lessening any anxieties both theirs and yours is going to be important to you
4686808 dont expect them to be on their best behavior 100 percent of the time remember they are going to be wary of this new person in your life for a reason their family life has already gone through some drastic changes and they are wary about more changes to come
4686809 while teen girls may talk what they say may be hurtful they may use words as well as actions as a way to rebel about the situation your job is to do a lot of listening and to ask them questions how do your children feel about the transition are they confused angry or hurt where are their fears
4686810 there are already too many secrets in the divorce process
4686811 i opposed my son moving there dads house didnt have any rules but did have lots of dollars available
4686812 when a child chooses one parent over the other some parents may experience feelings of rejection disloyalty and abandonment
4686813 conjuring up old wounds and reminders of a failed marriage
4686814 the longing for a loving and supportive connection with that parent
4686815 an effort to fill the empty void in their life that they may not be currently receiving from the relationship with the custodial parent
4686816 this usually becomes an issue when the child reaches adolescence and is trying to reduce the amount of conflict in their current home and or hopes there will be fewer rules and more freedom at the other parents home they may simply fall prey to the common wish for the other side where the grass is always greener
4686817 it was just an ugly time my fear for my other childrens safety escalated he began doing mean things i was almost glad that he went
4686818 once custody has been awarded the rule is that there must be a significant change in circumstances in most states a child simply wanting to be with the other parent would not be considered a change in circumstances
4686819 the test is what is in the best interests of the child
4686820 there are not a lot of detailed judicial guidelines so as to give judges a tremendous amount of discretion as what is in the best interests of the child based upon the testimony that they have heard in most states if the child is old enough and mature enough to express an opinion in the custody the court will give their opinion weight old enough and mature enough is generally considered to be around ten or twelve years of age as the child gets older the weight given to the opinion becomes much more significant
4686821 couples are most commonly concerned about the well being of their children
4686822 the disruption of the childs home and lifestyle particularly when having to transfer between two different households at various times of the week

4686826 divorce can have a tremendous impact on the behavior of children
4686827 many parents ask which scenario offers children the best outcome staying together for the familys sake while sacrificing the parents personal happiness or separating at the expense of the childs development and well being

4686831 military individuals are human beings with similar marital issues as the civilian population military couples have communication problems pertaining to money sex family and spirituality
4686832 if the individual is the one who is leaving then freedom and relief are the most prominent issues there is also the issue of future relationship with ones ex spouse financial responsibilities alimony support and entitlements to retirement
4686833 the simple answer is probably you enlisted in the military and youve been in the service six months and youre wife wants a divorce if you have no property children or a pension your situation is pretty well covered under the service members civil relief act however when you get into a divorce for a career military person who has accumulated a pension things get more complicated in these cases federal law overrides all state law concerning military divorces under federal law if a career service person has been in the military for 10 years or more a portion of his pension is paid directly from the military to the ex spouse if the service person has been in the military less than 10 years the pension money is paid to the soldier and he in turn is required to send a portion of his pension to his ex spouse

4686839 children dont want to compare their parents or choose one over the other
4686840 they simply want your permission to love each of you
4686841 you may have a legitimate grievance about your ex spouse but there is no reason to share this with the children if they are not hurt by the behavior in question

4686850 were trying to show the diversity of detroit musicians theres a lot of talent in this city even more than i realized to be honest
4686851 at first i would make the point clearly when introducing a band that quiet was very important
4686852 sometimes theyre a little talkative but i dont worry about that most people are there to hear the music
4686853 theres no question that divorce can sometimes exacerbate or cause depression
4686854 divorce destroys the whole dynamic of the family thats one of the worst side effects the family is the nucleus you were hoping would be there through the years divorce destroys it forever
4686855 their parents marriage represents security to children and the loss of it is significant
4686856 for a parent the divorce is a final break in their relationship with the other parent a child needs to understand that even though parents are divorcing they are not divorcing the child so try to help your children realize that even though your relationships have changed youre still their father and mother
4686857 young children dont really understand a divorce they just know theres been a significant change and they are very reactive to what their parents are feeling
4686858 developmentally theyre at a time when friends really important to them so if the divorce impacts where they live its going to really affect them
4686859 when your perfect partner goes perfectly wrong a survivors guide to loving or leaving the narcissist in your life
4686860 whether the guy is a narcissist drunk controller bi polar or just a jerk looking at your own health in the relationship is what really matters and certainly for that of your kids who are destined to grow up and repeat the pattern
4686861 these may help you to gain a clearer understanding of how a narcissist acts somatic narcissists may have more behaviors related to their bodies while the cerebral ones will be more intellectually oriented
4686862 not all of these behaviors will necessarily show up in each person and in fact many of us will likely have some of them ourselves but if you have checked off a vast majority of the boxes on this list the odds are in your favor that you are on treacherous ground
4686863 fathers can overcome some of the long term consequences of divorce by cultivating a close connection with their children
4686864 handling situations where there isnt an etiquette rule is about understanding how to combine manners with three fundamental principles that form the basis of how we get along with each other demonstrating respect showing consideration and being honest
4686865 its especially risky for men not to be connected with family
4686866 when men start to become disconnected from family they are more likely to get involved in behaviors that are going to be harmful to themselves or to their family they dont have the institution that was providing their life with meaning and direction the men really hit hard by divorce tend to be those who dont have a large support network in place
4686867 men in depression after divorce its big women are better able to assess their emotional state and more likely to get help depression for men is more closely tied to the loss of children than it is to the loss of the marriage as a result they may tend to remarry quickly to deal with this but that tends to compound the problem because the children wonder if this marriage will be successful
4686868 many children feel that one parent is responsible for the break up of their home since most children dont want a divorce they may feel angry for a while by and large this works itself out as the child matures little ones who feel theyre responsible for the divorce often work that out for themselves children get more measured views as they get older
4686869 what about the kids raising children before during and after divorce
4686870 adolescent may feel they dont want to celebrate days honoring parents because theyre angry with both of them i dont think they should try to change that
4686871 men tend to be very competitive and territorial but when theyre parenting the same child they need to think about being on the same football team not opposing teams
4686872 what is the one thing i can do to acknowledge the male father figure children need to understand there is only one dad and one mom and that will never ever change but that doesnt mean the other male in their life doesnt have good qualities they can benefit from
4686873 it can be tough to do it but its important stepfathers feel awfully neglected on fathers day if your kids dont learn good relationship skills from you than how will they know how to have a good relationship in their future
4686874 its painful to write out that check every month because it reminds you of the failure
4686875 our value in this society is about how much money i make and how much i owe
4686876 in other countries its about how much of myself i give to others and how much i am loved by them
4686877 o que seria do mundo se todos fossem bem ajustados haveria um tedio sem fim

4686941 well lands yes jane atkinson told me they seen you down at the feed store buying up plants left and right we gotta get em in the ground dont we

4686943 lord love a duck you been keeping those biddies in the house
4686944 i didnt really think the chicken thing through ms prouty
4686945 the old coop over there is falling apart so i was going to go into town today and see if i could get some boards and chicken wire to patch it truth is i dont know what im doing or how long were staying so well maybe mr walker will take them back
4686946 sending poor violet home with all them plants and chickens you know good and well she dont know what shes doin

4686950 honey dont none of us know how long well be here do we
4686951 a big part of it was that we shared a child
4686952 but i also felt and feel strongly that the extent to which i was unforgiving was harming me it is always the person who nurses the grudge or hatred who suffers and it would have made it difficult to live with equanimity
4686953 when an affair leads to divorce the person whos been cheated on usually feels humiliated bitter and enraged
4686954 this is not a favorable setting for the two people to remain friends and in fact the evidence is that divorces caused by infidelity are one of the least favorable settings for people to remain friends
4686955 whats often not understood is that forgiveness is a process that requires the best efforts of two people
4686956 the person seeking forgiveness has to work hard to earn it that usually means going through a very long period of eating crow listening at length to how his partner has been hurt living with her anger facing the enormous cost of the affair and he or she has to take specific and often hard measures to earn back her trust but even if he does the utmost to earn forgiveness his partner has to have a talent for forgiveness this includes the ability to regain trust when its been hurt
4686957 i hope the best for her in a theoretical way
4686958 but i am not sure i could ever trust her given that she kept a secret of that magnitude from me
4686959 storms cant hurt the sky a buddhist path through divorce da capo press lifelong books unites the disparate paths of marital discord self help and spirituality or maybe not so disparate our conversation with cohen about his own path and the rocks along the road follows below
4686960 storms cant hurt the sky marks what might seem an unusual transition what were the personal circumstances that caused you to write it are there connecting threads between the genres
4686961 boombox is a literary novel and now storms is a combination of memoir and self help
4686962 storms cant hurt the sky was inspired by my own experience of going through a divorce and struggling to figure out how to transform that painful experience into a more positive one
4686963 wondered aloud unfortunately if claire and i might be better off going separate ways
4686964 lessons if thats the right word of buddhism that can help anyone who finds themselves in a troubled relationship or is trying to deal with the pain of a break up does therapy sometimes put marriages that are already at risk over the edge
4686965 when discussing disability insurance it is important to distinguish between coverage offered through an employer which is known as group long term disability ltd insurance and coverage that individuals purchase on their own called individual disability income idi insurance
4686966 telling the spouse can be more damaging than keeping it in
4686967 who has counseled many patients in all stages of affairs
4686968 people often see themselves as victims when they go out to cheat they feel they are not getting enough attention that no one cares about them
4686969 the initial response is almost always intense anger and an incredible sense of abandonment
4686970 they will carry with them an attitude that says i am less than
4686971 they start to believe that all people cheat they will always be abandoned may unwittingly reflect that scenario and recreate it
4686972 often i have a patient tell me how guilty they feel about cheating
4686973 it is very different if the spouse already knows or will find out
4686974 it is so easy to disconnect when you are exhausted
4686975 it was not my top priority to pay attention to him
4686976 divorce shakes the whole foundation of your life and puts it on sand that blows in the wind
4686977 its a time of upheaval which means its the perfect opportunity to understand what matters most to you as well as what causes you to stay stuck so you can go about creating a life around your own unique passions and strengths
4686978 a divorce is a death its one of lifes great losses people want to start creating their new life right away but before they can move forward they have to work through the denial the grief the anger rage and depression that are part of divorce recovery
4686979 the single most difficult thing to do is to be able to fully accept what is versus what you think should be could be or might have been
4686980 survival mechanisms are all the ways you know how to be and get things done in your life
4686981 theyre not necessarily good or bad right or wrong theyre a way to manage your present and move forward but they arent the most empowering way to live your life
4686982 thanks for the great job youve done protecting me from failure disappointment and rejection but right now youre keeping me from stepping outside my comfort zone and thats where my goals are outside my comfort zone
4686983 realize you have gold nuggets you were born with and focus on the good rather than where youve failed
4686984 now look in the mirror and tell yourself you see those five things

4686988 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad we are also informed and believe that the ad was broadcast on television in ohio and pennsylvania the fact that it appears on the internet means it also reaches an audience well beyond those states
4686989 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on iser claims the mccain campaign has a track record of using music without permission made them stop and he used an abba song and a frankie valli song its ridiculous and its setting a terrible example
4686990 its shocking that they dont even attempt to get permission theres no copyright difference between using a song to sell cars or by people running for president the music industry continues to suffer due to lack of respect for intellectual property rights and a candidate for president has a duty to lead by example and ensuring their campaign does as well the copyright protections are derived from the constitution itself
4686991 jackson browne a woman beater has been druggy musician objects to a war hero using his song
4686992 we have sued the ohio republican party as well and we have been informed and believe that mccain and his campaign were well aware of the ad
4686993 is not politically motivated its a copyright infringement lawsuit pure and simple but the fact that sen mccain has used this song in a hit piece on barack obama is anathema to jackson
4686994 wow all the leftists disparaging the service record of one of our war heros amazing not surprising though
4686995 isnt it funny whenever someone scores a point against the republicans the only response they can make is to trash the character of the person scoring
4686996 the suit claims that use of the song violates the lanham act by falsely implying that browne is associated with or endorses the mccain candidacy the suit also claims the commercial violates brownes right of publicity under california law
4686997 we have a society where things arent going to well
4686998 were mired in an unpopular war and a depressed economy many gamers who are in their twenties and thirties feel politically disenfranchised gaming is an escape a way to decompress
4686999 this generation wants to participate which is why gaming along with social networking venues like is so popular as opposed to movies or tv which are passive activities
4687000 most gamers dont look like celebrities but like so many people they want to be celebrities with gaming you can try on a new identity or multiple identities and the other players dont know this its anonymous
4687001 videogame companies spend millions of dollars to produce these games and they are purposely designed to be compulsive repetition creates habits and these games challenge motor skills and cognitive skills by rewarding players with harder and harder levels you cant stop you are motivated this way to go on to the next kill
4687002 when someone is caught up in a compulsion he or she leaves other things out even their relationships when a compulsion goes on week in and week out its because the gamer would rather be caught up on that than address any of their lifes problems including the issues in their marriage
4687003 according to an analysis of campaign contributions by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics democrat barack obama has received nearly six times as much money from troops deployed overseas at the time of their contributions than has republican john mccain and the fiercely anti war ron paul though he suspended his campaign for the republican nomination months ago has received more than four times mccains haul despite mccains status as a decorated veteran and a historically republican bent among the military members of the armed services overall whether stationed overseas or at home are also favoring obama with their campaign contributions in 2008 by a 55 000 margin although 59 percent of federal contributions by military personnel has gone to republicans this cycle of money from the military to the presumed presidential nominees 57 percent has gone to obama
4687004 no big surprise being that most white evangelicals are prejudiced at least and outright racist at worst
4687005 three times as many evangelicals 12 percent are undecided this year as in june 2004 in 2000 that number was only 5 percent
4687006 sunday morning has been known and still is as the most segregated hour of the week
4687007 this isnt about what evangelicals think its about what theyll be told to do if they thought for themselves they wouldnt be evangelicals
4687008 evangelicals who are politically or socially active especially conservatives seem to be increasingly upwardly mobile suburban highly educated and with above average incomes contrary to many popular stereotypes
4687009 many in the christian right tend to get their information
4687010 we want to all be loved and needed and find that prince charming you can be very educated very attractive feel good about yourself but we all have susceptibility no matter how high our self esteem is
4687011 if a person is coming onto you wants all of your time is the perfect sexual match with lots of passion its hard not to be seduced by that you may not notice that the person is taking over your life by the time you look back and notice it you are already sucked in
4687012 they try to become a fixture in someones life and promote dependency what happens over time they start to take away your independence and become more controlling more critical they cripple your self esteem until you are doing the dance they want you to do
4687013 phoenix rising how to turn a devastating breakup into the best thing that ever happened to you
4687014 in my relationship i wasnt aware of it until the last year i really thought everything was my fault
4687015 i thought if i could just straighten up and fly right everything i did was wrong it was like if i cleaned the house i couldnt clean it well enough he would say i left streaks on the floor and if i was home cleaning the floor then i was wrong for not taking the kids to the park if i took the kids to the park then why didnt i clean the house i was being held to impossible standards
4687016 its called stockholm syndrome back in 1973 in sweden bank robbers broke into a bank and strapped explosives on their captives by the time the police broke in the victims were worried for the safety of the captors
4687017 the captives are actually trying to come up with a way to endear themselves to their captors to keep them safe in the case of a woman in a controlling relationship she is subconsciously trying to keep herself safe
4687018 kerry himself is already implementing the lessons of 2004 the massachusetts senator launched a website wednesday truth fights back challenging the assertions in corsis book
4687019 believe obamas senior aides must figure out how to effectively and directly respond to the book
4687020 initially wanted to respond directly to the charges but his top circle of advisers after heated debate counseled against it former senior advisers have said in the subsequent weeks that august as the national media picked up the story and began constantly looping the ads kerrys campaign reversed itself and went on the offensive today within kerrys circle and outside it the view is that the response was too late
4687021 recent reports on obamas florida spending which easily overwhelms john mccains suggest that the sunshine state remains at least at this point the democratic nominees top pickoff target for 2008 much as it was for john kerry in 2004 and al gore in 2000
4687022 heres the math since the start of the general election season obama has dropped 6 51 million a full 18 percent of his overall ad spending and by the largest chunk of change allotted to any one state to broadcast 10 000 commercials on florida television mccains total disbursement 0 zero ads meanwhile chicago has sent more than 200 full time staffers and signed up at least 150 000 online volunteers to man the states 35 field offices the most of any battleground mccains local staff is a quarter of the size and much of it is shared with the state party
4687023 if obama can win florida on nov 4 which george w bush carried by five points in almost guaranteed to win the white house
4687024 the simple fact is that at least two of the candidates mccain is thinking very seriously about picking as his second in command tom ridge and sen joe lieberman i conn who are publicly in favor of abortion rights a third potential candidate former massachusetts gov mitt romney was supportive of abortion rights until a few years ago although he has now adopted a solidly pro life position
4687025 but there isnt a whole lot of love lost between the two groups would mccain picking a pro choice vice president inflame these critical voters who have largely held their collective tongues to this point or will ardently pro life voters make a pragmatic decision and stay behind mccain under the belief that the arizona senator would be a far better president for the issues important to them than would obama
4687026 i can remember being one of a small group of people who came to bill ayers house to learn that alice palmer was stepping down from the senate and running for congress
4687027 there are several reasons why its important for couples to meet their counselor halfway and why it often doesnt happen
4687028 making love playing power men women amp the rewards of intimate justice
4687029 his view centers on fairness and who has power to initiate change
4687030 when a couple encounters relationship difficulties both partners need to work with the therapist toward healing
4687031 typically however the woman in a heterosexual relationship and more generically the partner with less power moves more willingly toward the therapist and toward change her initiative may preserve the relationship for a time but with a now even more lopsided power arrangement at this point there remains little hope for the partnership when both partners meet the therapist halfway however together they set the foundation for fairness with this initial step toward fairness they activate the potential to heal their bond
4687032 a common concern for couples without children who are divorcing is that they have adequate financial resources to live comfortably and that there is fair distribution of assets
4687033 each spouse wants to make sure that they are able to maintain their lifestyle
4687034 this is often difficult for a spouse who has not worked outside the home for an extended period of time
4687035 childless couples contemplating divorce frequently center on self examination and establishing healthy emotional boundaries for future relationships
4687036 a primary concern is repeating the errors in the broken relationship in the next relationship
4687037 this can be a well founded concern if they did not make sufficient effort to fully assess and own their share of responsibility and blame it all on the other person instead
4687038 some couples who are divorcing feel concerned about losing mutual friends and family
4687039 we try to see if we can work out ways in which both partners can feel comfortable sharing mutual family members and friends more often than not this can be arranged by creating schedules not unlike the parenting visitation schedules described above
4687040 if family were attached to the former spouse they may sorrowfully divorce that person from their lives out of loyalty to their own but with misgivings as well
4687041 divorced people need to be aware that change begets more change as valued others are impacted some even picking social sides with one ex partner and forsaking a continuing relationship with the other
4687042 for many clients they feel like they cannot engage in relationships again
4687043 the hurt and lack of trust they feel makes the idea of dating and getting involved with someone new very difficult
4687044 reestablishment of their personal identity minus the inclusion of a former partner and becoming comfortable with the self as an individual
4687045 the best advice is to make no major personal changes for at least three four months devoting that time to self examination and recovery
4687046 then take new freedoms and make new changes with deliberation and moderation not with impulse and excess
4687047 has testified about her research before the house select committee on children youth and families in washington d c
4687048 children who go through multiple divorces are not as well adjusted as children who endure only one divorce
4687049 parents who divorce repeatedly tend to be impulsive choose bad partners and lack the ability to sustain relationships so the children of these parents tend to grow up with a built in role model disadvantage in addition to multiple divorce handicap
4687050 multiple divorces can make the practicality of a childs relationships with adults and with peers more challenging because there are more settings that the child is identifying with more settings that she considers home
4687051 what really complicates this is where there are limited economic resources this makes addressing a childs need for continuity and security a lot harder as children grow up under these circumstances they are more likely to lose the opportunity to develop secure social networks and skills that kids from more financially secure families and less disrupted families find easier to gain
4687052 these children also develop some special skills they learn how to get along in diverse situations how to problem solve they learn independence for many children of divorce including multiple divorces their resilience means that they will move forward like other kids
4687053 kids gain this competence at a cost because it takes a lot of strength and focus to handle these situations given that children of multiple divorces are especially likely to come from poorer families their challenges continue as they move into adulthood and they need support for getting a solid college education in order to help them reach secure positions in life
4687054 what children experience more than repeat divorces is the repeated loss of new adult figures in their lives sometimes significant ones
4687055 as their parents date and perhaps live with romantic partners after their first divorce young children can quickly form attachments to these new figures in their lives the loss can be wrenching when the romance breaks up my advice to single parents is go slow for your children and probably for yourself too
4687056 i knew at the wedding that the marriage wouldnt last
4687057 demographers have known for a long time that different background factors are associated with an increased risk of divorce
4687058 is it an issue that better educated better off people are recognizing the benefits of marriage is it that they have better marriage and family options or is it nothing to do with that people are more able to put things off for tomorrow more able to go to college save invest in marriage like they would an education
4687059 i guess the question is would you arrange this marriage for yourself
4687060 la tir al suelo d ndole patadas arrastr ndola y tir ndole de los pelos

4687064 it was like taking every emotion you ever had and putting it on the tumble setting in your clothes dryer
4687065 id just completed my military career and she was starting to get traction in her own job so for a year and a half we went off in different directions working different shifts i was giving her an opportunity to grow just as she had given me during my career i loved her i trusted her if youve only been married once you dont know what to expect
4687066 her bags were already packed shed left them by the door
4687067 i was angry at myself for being played the fool
4687068 feelings of betrayal are justified the straight spouse must now adjust the perception of his or her life to a new reality
4687069 many people dont know if theyre gay when they get married
4687070 even if they admit to themselves that they are gay they ask themselves should i do what is best for myself or what is right for my family
4687071 they feel they are sacrificing something many dont want to hide it anymore
4687072 the straight spouse is that chalk line on the crime scene
4687073 when id heard i was relieved to find out what had been wrong why he had been unresponsive and got depressed during our marriage
4687074 one third will break up right away within a year
4687075 another third will stay together for a while but then eventually separate the last third will try to work it out but within three years only half of these marriages will succeed if they do its because these partners feel its no elses business
4687076 the main concern is how to reduce the pain of the children as much as possible
4687077 thats their language playing video games it was a challenge to combine a serious issue like divorce with a video game
4687078 when i see the effect the game has on children i think there are so many more that need it
4687079 on the one hand moose has to finish the game and on the other he cant bring his parents back together
4687080 i think we came up with a very nice solution
4687081 zipland provides a safe place for kids to work through some of their feelings in a subversive atmosphere that is fun
4687082 most kids like video games and heres a very healthy useful one the children felt safe practicing in the journal until they had the courage and skills to transfer them to the parents directly
4687083 in one emotionally powerful session he admitted he was scared because he feared he might not be able to stop hurting her and would kill her
4687084 when we used the zipland game he stayed with the journal lots and mostly wrote angry angry angry and we processed that intense anger and brought in his father for several sessions too
4687085 children need to eventually learn skills to speak directly about their feelings
4687086 my work generally and ideally involves various family members together the game can be used in advance of that touchy work to prepare children who always fear their parents will be mad at them if they tell them how angry they are that their family has changed forever
4687087 if it feels like homework to them theyre more likely to resist
4687088 with a computer game its something they want to do
4687089 that seems to be the most appealing part of using the game
4687090 it gives us an opportunity to talk about issues we didnt talk about at 14
4687091 he hasnt been slotted as a convention speaker yet which is curious since gore is one of the partys superstars and its most effective spokesperson on energy and the environment are they holding off because hes a finalist for veep and i have two pretty good sources who say gore and obama are actively exploring an administration slot for al
4687092 when intercourse is suddenly a possibility again relationship issues can emerge or resurface as can dramatic differences in libido the bottom line is that couples should try to regard these drugs as an opportunity to renew their sexual relationship while realizing that ed drugs are neither a mandate to have intercourse nor a panacea for every problem in the bedroom
4687093 the medication works only if the man is feeling sexual desire for his partner
4687094 viagra should be a tool for a couple not just him couples should work together to solve their sexual problems but sometimes that doesnt happen thats my biggest problem with viagra
4687095 if someone is going to take viagra my advice is that they talk about it with their partner before getting it possibly they should even go with their partner to the physicians office to find out how to best use it
4687096 a lot of men will use it and have sex but they leave out the woman
4687097 there is certainly the possibility that a husband could have an affair after taking viagra however as a couple gets older and they spend their lives together an affair late in life doesnt necessarily mean the end of their marriage but it can complicate thing
4687098 monogamy is a morality case a man cannot fit into
4687099 the biological differences between men and women do not get us very far in terms of understanding affairs
4687100 both men and women have different levels of societal permission
4687101 women are more likely to connect with loneliness they are more likely to enter into affairs when they are already done with their marriage
4687102 men are much more likely to say their marriages were fine
4687103 clearly once an affair is entered into some dissatisfaction starts
4687104 they report feeling off track and that they miss admiration and appreciation especially sometimes they can get involved with a woman who will be all about them and give them back some of those old feelings
4687105 one third of people in the singles dating scene were attached and lying about it
4687106 we have the neglected housewife the woman who likes married men and the woman who believes all the best guys are taken
4687107 is that a costume or is that what they normally dress like
4687108 well what the hell are you doing here you dont belong
4687109 organized truthful willing to listen to my advice and take it and willing to work together with me to achieve their goals
4687110 im not a psychologist and i dont want to be one if a client is unsure about whether or not she wants a divorce she needs to make the decision before coming to see me using me as a sounding board on her marriage is not the best use of my time or her money
4687111 i encourage each client to use our first meeting to tell me about his case and to learn about the divorce process its time commitment and its costs i also have an opportunity to lay out the options and the potential consequences of each decision the client can then take the paperwork home and reflect
4687112 you know whats funny i honestly didnt see him as being nearly as controlling until we separated
4687113 he cant seem to accept the fact that he doesnt and cant influence what i do who i see and how i act
4687114 i totally see it now but at the time i didnt i think part of it was that it looked perfect from the outside looking in i dont know if i was the classic example
4687115 i lived in wealthy community i had a gorgeous house i didnt realize
4687116 many times the person who is being controlled doesnt even know it they think they are the ones doing something wrong
4687117 i see that dynamic a lot where the abused person is taking the blame it gets worse as time goes on the longer you are in it the more it erodes your self esteem and the weaker you get consequently the weaker you get the stronger they get and their control issues come out more and more
4687118 it can get dangerous when someone doesnt respect you then they can objectify you and do anything to you and justify it
4687119 the commuter marriage keep your relationship close while youre far apart adams media april 2008
4687120 theres a difference between critical and nasty no one likes critical and maybe its not pleasant but its not terrible or out of line on its own
4687121 but when it gets nasty when you are reduced to being a bitch for not doing something they want you to do then you arent worth anything
4687122 it was 9 30 at night he met them outside and he made all kinds of crazy stories up he came up with this great story about how i would never be happy and about how i eventually attacked him and they arrested me
4687123 literally this is about making another person crazy its like they hypnotize the people around them they mesmerize you into believing that everything they say is the truth and make you question your own instincts
4687124 this isnt about how fast someone can download a full length movie
4687125 speed matters to our economy and our ability to remain competitive in a global marketplace rural development telemedicine and distance learning all rely on truly high speed universal networks
4687126 the test results demonstrate the critical need for the senate to pass s 1492 the broadband data improvement act to move the u s toward a national broadband policy
4687127 earlier this year the house of representatives passed a similar measure the broadband census of america act to support the collection of data about broadband deployment
4687128 construct an infrastructure with enough capacity for 10 mbps downstream and 1 mbps upstream by 2010
4687129 we are the only industrialized nation without a national policy to promote universal high speed internet access and it shows
4687130 most of our speed test users logged on with broadband connections such as dsl modem or fiber people with dial up connections didnt take the test because it took them too long so even these dismal statistics paint a rosier than reality picture of connection speeds across the country
4687131 now is that time for all good men and women to come to aid of the country the people the planet and the truth
4687132 isnt it getting colder of course it is because sun spot activity has stopped almost entirely now global warming advocates sound like george bush 5 years ago they say global climate change and rarely global warming what could be more hypocritical report this comment
4687133 you need to go back to a 19th century lifestyle of candlelight and mule power
4687134 a common law marriage in colorado is valid for all purposes the same as a ceremonial marriage it can be terminated only by death or divorce
4687135 unless the parties were in a common law marriage prior to1939
4687136 although california does not recognize common law marriage in its state if you were previously married through common law in another state and later move to california california will recognize your previous marriage
4687137 you must establish that your state acknowledges common law marriage and produce a valid marriage certificate
4687138 basically if the other party challenges the divorce you may have to make a motion for a separate hearing for the judgeto determine whether there was a valid marriage in another state once this has been adjudged the matter will continue as a regular divorce
4687139 there must be an evidentiary hearing which involves hearing testimony showing documents prior to the actual dissolution of a marriage case
4687140 to be avalid marriage in a non common law state if the parties met the requirements of the common law marriage state the burden is going to be on the person who wants to assert that there was a common lawmarriage in place
4687141 prepare yourself for some difficult hurdles based on the case law you are going to have to bring either a palimony claim or a claim for quasi contractual relief meaning you are going to have to ask the court to provide you with equitable relief based on contract principles not on statutory principles of equitable distribution alimony etc
4687142 we took three days and the criticism lasted weeks and weeks it looked like we spent five weeks lying on the beach and we spent two hours
4687143 i already knew about port charlotte because my parents and my sister lived here
4687144 i knew the weather was great and things down here were a lot cheaper
4687145 we recommend that the person wait a year before making another big life change like moving
4687146 sometimes they hope by moving out of an area with their children then magically their life will change oftentimes that doesnt work
4687147 im going to community college full time working full time and being a mom full time this past semester i was on the deans list at school
4687148 im in my sophomore year and hope to graduate next summer with a degree in early childhood education i want to open my own preschool after graduation
4687149 people ask me how good the local schools are and how bad is the crime rate i tell them they can find all that kind stuff on the web
4687150 massachusetts will lead the way in reducing the emissions that threaten the planet with climate change
4687151 pension issues are complicated and have many pitfalls for the unwary pension plans are the trickiest issues in divorce
4687152 normally in a pension division through a qualified domestic relations order the spouse is entitled to half of the pension accrued during the marriage
4687153 the first spouse to get their qualified domestic relations order qualified wins the second order that is qualified can only divide the benefits that remain after the first order is addressed
4687154 a defined benefits pension is where you know exactly what the future benefits will be a defined contribution pension is one that is contributed to often a 401k where amounts are deposited monthly into an account pensions in many large companies also have a savings stock purchase plan executives have additional pensions
4687155 with the401 k type plan the non employee spouse is receiving a lump sum of money that will either remain in the current plan or may be rolled over into their own plan
4687156 the most unique aspect of a government pension is that it usually exists for the employee in lieu of social security and as such when the benefit is being divided it must be weighed against any social security benefit that the non employee spouse may have in many governmental pensions there is a provision that only one spouse may receive a benefit in certain circumstances an ex spouse may lose what has been given to them by the court by virtue of their ex getting remarried
4687157 military and government pensions are governed by their own set of laws and are entirely distinct from private sector pensions
4687158 it is imperative to work with someone with experience a mistake may not be clear for many years and by that time it will be way too late to fix the situation
4687159 its important however to remember that retirement assets have not necessarily been taxed yet
4687160 stop to the extent possible any contributions while the divorce is going on if at the end of the day you are going to be losing a portion of the account it is best to stop contributing to that account
4687161 there are survivorship benefits if the decree is properly drafted it would include these
4687162 rosen suggests caution when the company of thepensioner supplies forms
4687163 it is tempting to use the forms provided by the company to divide pensions watch out lawyers for the pension plan draft those forms they are drafted to protect the plan not the employee and not the spouse
4687164 it is possible for an expert to tell you based on life expectancy and the terms of the pension what that eventual benefit may be worth this is important if you wish to negotiate the value of this pension against other assets for example while a pension may only pay 1 500 a month upon retirement given your life expectancy this may result in that pension having an actual value of hundreds of thousands of dollars
4687165 normally shared pensions are pooled an actuarial study can also be done and look at the present value of the benefits and then trade them off on a case by case basis
4687166 it would be a terrible time trying to get in and out of ashby street
4687167 we have to come up with some new way of doing business
4687168 pretty much everybody on the street here was pleased with that
4687169 i feel sorry for the businesses but weve been living here for almost 50 years
4687170 youre driving down main street and a car or truck could pop out every 100 feet just about
4687171 it didnt create a problem back when it was horse and buggy traffic but with 18 000 cars a day it creates a problem
4687172 when the streets closed off it kind of makes that next to impossible
4687173 what do i think about my future as a gay man
4687174 jika mahu saya bersumpah dengan nama allah insya allah saya akan lakukan
4687175 saya mencabar mereka memberikan bukti bukti sebelum menuduh dan mengaitkan saya
4687176 saya sedia menerima apa sahaja hukuman jika dibuat mengikut undang undang yang adil
4687177 saya akan tunduk jika mereka boleh memberikan bukti tuduhan terhadap saya
4687178 jika mahu saya bersumpah dengan nama allah insya allah saya akan lakukan
4687179 saya telah bertanya kepada ulama ulama mereka melarang saya bersumpah
4687180 mengapa kes ini dibangkitkan sekarang kerana kita maju ke depan kamu main drama sivaji the boss kita main drama sivaji the boss
4687181 tetapi ia diulang dengan jahat dan dengan fitnah yang kejam kita tidak terima ini
4687182 saya akan bongkar habis habisan siasatan polis tidak seteruk tahun 1998 1999 tetapi akan beri kerjasama penuh untuk siasatan
4687183 kalau ada bukti saya telefon dan surat yang saya hantar kepada amerika syarikat saya boleh diambil tindakan
4687184 hi its me just having a laid back sunday and hoping you are too give me a call when you get a minute
4687185 he was certainly different than anyone ive ever dated and miles away from my ex who was a banker fun was what was missing from my marriage and thats the main quality the magician had he made me laugh and i felt really comfortable with him it felt great and there were no warning signs hed make himself disappear
4687186 often times men would rather remove themselves from a relationship than confront whats going on they dont want to be perceived as the bad guy what they fail to recognize is that by not acknowledging the situation that bad guy moniker becomes a self fulfilling prophecy its important to keep in mind is that the reason he dropped the ball has nothing to do with you
4687187 the magician and i were dating for about six weeks when all of a sudden he disappeared i kept my contacting him to a minimum because i didnt wan to be one of those annoying women it was the not knowing what happened to him that drove me crazy i kept thinking it was something i said that turned him off
4687188 a bayh pick would have the feel of bill clintons 1992 successful choice of al gore
4687189 if there lives a member of congress who knows more about the environment he or she isnt talking much less writing
4687190 so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh so gore by the early 1990s had demonstrated the seriouness of purpose intellectual depth and willingness to act that foretold the impressive career that would follow and bayh
4687191 im all about biden for many reasons the first being hes the most qualified
4687192 he has excellent experience he has been in the senate since 1985 and he serves on the armed services committee
4687193 in late june polls conducted by the wall street journal nbc and fox opinion dynamics using entirely different samples both showed sen clinton giving sen obama a 3 bump pushing him over 51 for the first time when the two of them were paired against sen mccain and gov romney
4687194 most recently in nationwide polling on july 22 23 a fox opinion dynamics poll showed a more dramatic bump of 8 with sen clinton as sen obamas vice presidential running mate in a head on match it was sen obama 41 to sen mccains 40 this was before the intense media coverage of his european trip but with exactly the same sample when all voters were presented with the choice of an obama clinton ticket vs mccain romney the results were obama clinton 48 7 and mccain romney 39 1
4687195 according to the july 22 23 fox opinion dynamics poll in an obama mccain head on match up sen
4687196 so what about independents an obama clinton ticket appears to gain some strength in this critical swing voter group with an obama mccain head on contest independents are evenly divided 32 30 with sen obama over sen mccain but with an obama clinton ticket vs a mccain romney ticket the independents favor obama clinton 38 30 a statistically significant 6 increase in a crucial voter group
4687197 i too think senator kerry is a brilliant man who clearly beat bush in the debates by miles but he does not inspire much respect in the general population which is incredibly unfair
4687198 senator clintons poorly run campaign her inability to concede error and the irresponsible behavior of bill make me think she would not be a good president should she need to step in
4687199 but why did hillary give up we dont do that here this we do not understand if obama picks her as a partner he will be considered weak by much of the world
4687200 the weak person wants both the stability of their spouse plus the excitement of the affair

4687205 when someone is willing to cheat you automatically know one character trait of theirs a lack of emotional courage
4687206 he was technically still married but they were living separately
4687207 the right thing to do would have been to walk away and let them sort things out
4687208 but we did so with this shadow hanging over us
4687209 the main reason people get divorced is because of money
4687210 its hard enough to make ends meet when you are a single household sometimes it is even harder to operate two households
4687211 i want to pay child support i want to fulfill my obligations
4687212 people who are creditors in bankruptcy would be well advised to assume the worst about what the judge will decide
4687213 its very important that if this is going on that they retain a bankruptcy professional
4687214 most people who are filing for bankruptcy are doing it with the help of a bankruptcy lawyer
4687215 all family law claims are now called first priority that means that they enjoy a priority when it comes time for the trustee to decide who gets paid and who doesnt
4687216 when you file for bankruptcy one of the very first things that happens is that all creditors have to quit picking on you for a little while
4687217 what the automatic stay says is that when i file for bankruptcy you cant pick on me for a while its a powerful incentive for people to file for bankruptcy
4687218 child support and alimony both of these are current supports can be processed and prosecuted even despite the stay
4687219 support whether its child support maintenance alimony are not discharged
4687220 i was pretty consumed by the loss of family security and i didnt know how to support both my parents when my own support was eroding
4687221 our skin was so thin that it became all but impossible to communicate without damaging each other
4687222 we just didnt have the skills we needed to get past unspoken hurts
4687223 i felt like i had a whole new mom she was almost unrecognizable
4687224 it wasnt what she said it was who she was and her way of being she was completely at peace it was like mom unleashed that created security for me to trust that i could talk with her about things we couldnt talk about before i knew that together we could handle anything
4687225 they had some years of happiness that brought me here
4687226 oh mrs lewis can you wait a few minutes i need to talk to you
4687227 pre k is a chance to get your children geared up and ready for real school show them the ropes so to speak and watch them grow into great pupils ready to tackle what kindergarten is to bring
4687228 dat was ik niet hoor dat was mijn lichaam en dat is alleen maar vel met een spook erin
4687229 kan die beroerde muziek wat zachter want die leidt mij af van zoek maar uit mijn eigen werkzaamheden op de pc het lezen van de krant het kijken naar de televisie enz enz
4687230 gaat dan heen onderwijst alle volken en doopt hen in de naam van de vader en de zoon en de heilige geest en leert hen onderhouden al wat ik u geboden heb en zie ik ben met u al de dagen tot aan de voleinding der wereld
4687231 als wij toestaan dat de islam achter de voordeur moet blijven en dat de invloed van de koran hier ingeperkt wordt moeten wij christenen straks wellicht ook onze kerken sluiten en wordt de bijbel misschien zelfs wel verboden liever een afgod steunen en een satanisch boek beschermen dan ons eigen geloof teruggedrongen te zien worden tot in de priv sfeer
4687232 zie ik kom spoedig en mijn loon is bij mij om een ieder te vergelden naardat zijn werk is ik ben de alfa en de omega de eerste en de laatste het begin en het einde zalig zij die hun gewaden wassen opdat zij recht mogen hebben op het geboomte des levens en door de poorten ingaan in de stad buiten zijn de honden en de tovenaars de hoereerders de moordenaars de afgodendienaars en ieder die de leugen liefheeft en doet
4687233 hebben we ons voor niets zo druk gemaakt over de komst van de film van wilders nu er zo weinig gebeurd is
4687234 gij zult geen waarheid spreken en niet bekritiseren en niet aanvallen en niet schokken
4687235 ik had toch moeite met de associatie met mijn vredelievendheid wat ik in mijn geloof vindt
4687236 aan de vruchten zult gij hen kennen aan een goede boom kunnen geen slechte vruchten groeien en aan een slechte boom vind je geen goede vruchten
4687237 wilders heeft in feite het tegendeel bereikt van wat hij wilde
4687238 alle menschen werden br der mits tot een gesprek bereid
4687239 dat als n parlementari r hier iets zegt dat dat dan niet de mening van de hele regering en het hele volk is
4687240 geert wilders is de gevangene van zijn eigen media verslaving
4687241 want toorn boosheid van god openbaart zich over alle goddeloosheid
4687242 well if foote really wanted to stay here he would have signed for how much howson was offering
4687243 my first choice would be for people to work hard on their marriage when people are willing to do the work they really can reconnect and they can heal different things that have happened between them that have caused anger and resentment and hurt feelings
4687244 if that doesnt happen they can hang on but if they really dont want to be together then i think they should wait until after college
4687245 thats a huge transition for kids and to throw into that divorce its too hard
4687246 i think adults too often think oh the kids will be okay
4687247 i think that is becoming pervasive its really hard on kids
4687248 i think it is better for them if they can just stay together
4687249 its certainly hard it takes a lot of maturity on the part of adults to work on their marriage and put in the effort to make the marriage better its hard
4687250 if you are not the custodial parent you miss all of that those opportunities for your children to talk to you
4687251 i think it makes a huge difference and i know that there are a lot of people who agree with that and say kids will be fine well kids will not be fine
4687252 of course you can even if it means getting a lawyer and calling the sheriff but usually you can find out why he wont move out and come to an agreement sometimes its financial he sees the house as at least half his and wont relinquish it that requires legal intervention sometimes is emotional
4687253 the commuter marriage keep your relationship close while youre far apart adams media april 2008
4687254 emotionally even though you have made it clear that you want him out hanging around where he is not wanted is just how it is the options are limited in his thinking either being alone which is scary or staying where he is its sad if you think about
4687255 try to find out what he needs in order to get him out if its to help him get an apartment and help him decorate it then do it of course you are enabling him but you are enabling him to be gone and you are willing to do whatever you need to get him gone
4687256 as a practitioner i advise if there are children involved that neither leave the marital home until there is a custody agreement in place if you are looking to share custody you dont want the perception that you are ready to leave until everything is in place
4687257 you cant get the spouse out of house unless you can prove there is some kind of danger
4687258 you can get exclusive occupancy during a divorce but it is very difficult emotionally and physically the courts dont like to kick people out of their houses
4687259 most people get upset because its politically incorrect well so is life
4687260 people want the money its not a big secret once again im living on 30 000 a year if i had a million dollars i dont have to do this nonsense job anymore that actually can be appealing to a lot of people
4687261 i have not found that money is the primary criteria although its always a factor for women
4687262 many divorced parents found that they originally married for the wrong reasons including putting money first and then suffered the consequences of a marriage devoid of intimacy respect and parental collaboration
4687263 these people certainly try to create new relationships with healthier outcomes
4687264 monogamy is a morality case a man cannot fit into
4687265 the biological differences between men and women do not get us very far in terms of understanding affairs
4687266 both men and women have different levels of societal permission
4687267 women are more likely to connect with loneliness they are more likely to enter into affairs when they are already done with their marriage
4687268 men are much more likely to say their marriages were fine
4687269 clearly once an affair is entered into some dissatisfaction starts
4687270 they report feeling off track and that they miss admiration and appreciation especially sometimes they can get involved with a woman who will be all about them and give them back some of those old feelings
4687271 one third of people in the singles dating scene were attached and lying about it
4687272 we have the neglected housewife the woman who likes married men and the woman who believes all the best guys are taken
4687273 i dont want to wait a whole two weeks for my copy of alix olsons documentary ill just go to borders itll be here in a coupla days

4687275 hoe kunnen mensen die claimen gelovige christenen te zijn en het woord van god te kennen z schandalig blind laf en ongehoorzaam zijn
4687276 leer ons aangaande de weg die wij moeten gaan om behouden te worden
4687277 dit is een stap in de verkeerde richting niet meer vrijheid maar juist minder
4687278 onze programma s zijn niet op de lokale zenders maar hoe lang zal het duren voordat de overheden de striktere censuur zullen gaan toepassen op productieniveau in de arabische landen waar wij opereren
4687279 met vrijheid van meningsuiting moet op een verstandige en verantwoorde manier worden omgegaan om overstijgende belangen van de arabische staten te beschermen
4687280 when you dont feel passionate about your career there may be a willingness to sabotage it with an office romance
4687281 when you get caught up in the romance you may find yourself thinking who cares if it ends badly and i lose my job ill just find another one if so my advice is to find a job you love and to do so on your own terms its better than taking the chance of being escorted out of your current job by the security staff however if you really love your career consider that when making a choice about whether to get romantically involved with a coworker the key here is to be aware of what is important to you and to make your choices from that place of awareness
4687282 i had always felt like no one really knew or quite understood the level of chaos that had existed in my life and this was a way to express it all without burdening others with such horror or having to explain myself re explain myself
4687283 it served as a means to tell the truth of my experiences but to no one in particular
4687284 when couples split up bills are no longer jointly paid so if you are contemplating a divorce its critical to acknowledge the financial components that come along with it
4687285 write down from your checkbook and credit card statements what you actually spend and not what you estimate you spend most people are shocked by what they discover
4687286 my stepdaughter would sulk give me dirty looks and mutter horrible things
4687287 when she was 15 she came to stay with us for a couple months in the summer
4687288 put a lot of thought into setting up a new home and how the home is run
4687289 new rules and new ways of doing things are not thought out well confusion runs rampant people want to know who is in charge and what the game plan is so the couple needs to sit down and discuss alone how the household will function who does what chores do cell phones come to the dinner table etc these then need to be communicated to everyone preferably at the same time
4687290 both my step parents turned out to be wonderful people
4687291 neither of my new step parents ever insisted on being called
4687292 the book of no 250 ways to say it and mean it and stop people pleasing forever
4687293 nobody likes new rules particularly when they require more effort than youve been used to more baths more helping fewer food choices at meals and so forth as soon as possible is the time to begin making the changes
4687294 how much and what a stepparent does will be dependent of course on the childrens ages with younger children a stepparent will need to have authority as if s he were the parent
4687295 the child rearing guidelines that most people learn growing up with two biological parents often do not apply in stepfamilies this is especially true in the case of adolescents
4687296 di antaranya sampah bisa dijadikan pupuk pakan ternak pakan ikan dan batako

4687300 het lijkt me toch iets te gemakkelijk dat satan een interpretatie van elke heidense god zou zijn

4687302 dit is het land waarin jullie wonen een fantastisch land maar wel een land waar niet alles kan en niet alles mag vrijheid moet verzorgd en bewaard en verdedigd worden

4687304 any time you have a preseason game you take the good and the bad
4687305 am i disappointed the way we played sure that series
4687306 its like youre trying to crank the car up a bit more every week
4687307 weve given up a couple long drives carolina didnt score this time pittsburgh was able to score on theirs so we just have to make sure we dont give up those long drives and get off the field bring it out and get some turnovers too
4687308 sometimes men will show up to a courtroom and they may come right off of a job site
4687309 he may look like his life is all about work instead of preparing to talk to someone about a serious matter like his children
4687310 you dont want to wear your diamond studded earrings dont drench yourself in jewelry look like your common average person
4687311 that can be detrimental to a man if he will speak more about his feelings and his plans for his children he may do better in court and have a better chance of having shared parent arrangements
4687312 i have had attorneys tell me that when a person comes in and hands their life over to the attorney the parent becomes the caboose on the train
4687313 my argument was all about how this was not a practical move and how it was not a good move for our daughter
4687314 it was pretty clear to the court i was an involved parent
4687315 i didnt bring up anything from the past they just dont want to hear that
4687316 at our first court hearing my ex husband was on the stand and asked by the judge if he had access to firearms
4687317 six months later two handguns that my husband had hidden were discovered even though the guns were not illegal the judge was furious that he was lied to
4687318 from that moment on the judge was able to decipher who was telling the truth in our divorce my husband lost all credibility by telling that lie
4687319 even if youve got something to say that is going to make you look bad being honest about it is going to make you look good
4687320 dont go into court with assumptions always go into court being humble you can say ok i have the upper hand in this case that arrogance is going to show in the courtroom that is one thing the judge is going to look at that judge has great discretion on how he rules
4687321 while i am sure there are celebrities that have tried to divorce their spouses right before the 10 years with the hope that they will not be bound to pay spousal support until one of them dies or the payee spouse gets re married this type of game playing usually does not work with the family law court system
4687322 the 10 year mark is not viewed by the courts as a strict line in the sand
4687323 therefore if a person has been married for 9 years it too could be considered a marriage of long duration the court could treat a marriage of 9 years the same way they treat a marriage of 10 years or more it is a gray area and is subjective to the facts of the each case
4687324 the amount of spousal support is based upon many factors one of the prevalent factors is income from all sources for both parties
4687325 if for any reason the prenup was signed under pressure it can be broken clear proof of coercion duress fraud undue influence or bad intent will void the document
4687326 a provision that says one spouse must lose weight or even child support wont be provided upon divorce wouldnt stand up in court
4687327 judges are the ones who make the final rulings and they are human beings just like everyone else they are reading the faces in the room and body language they are thinking does this smell fair blanket complete waivers arent viewed as fair did the partner have adequate legal representation were the issues thought about negotiated discussed disclosed the judges look for financial disclosure and the lack of it they weigh any appearance that you were trying to mislead which will taint the entire document as disreputable consider this anytime there is nondisclosure there is a 50 50 shot it gets thrown out all the more reason you want to not only disclose but over disclose
4687328 you can write in anything you want but sometimes a judge will throw out a clause that he feels is inequitable in fact judges can be inconsistent depending on the day the weather or the judges own life experience he can ignore or disregard any provision
4687329 both you and your future spouse have a fiduciary responsibility to bring all of this forward
4687330 handling situations where there isnt an etiquette rule is about understanding how to combine manners with three fundamental principles that form the basis of how we get along with each other demonstrating respect showing consideration and being honest
4687331 the gift of good manners a parents guide to raising respectful kind considerate children
4687332 getting through mothers day is really about how were learning to get along with each other in this very painful situation
4687333 youre not going to make it better by saying you have to give her a gift just because shes your mother
4687334 being honest means sometimes you have to let the holiday go without a lot of celebration so you can have some healing if mothers day leads to some opportunities for that great if not dont push especially the first year
4687335 kids live a long time hoping mom and dad will get back together
4687336 they may dream about the family going out to dinner on mothers day like they always did and hope that will be the catalyst for mom and dad to reunite parents need to be respectful of those feelings while at the same time telling them we cant do that because things are different if you try and make it like it was when you were a family youre only pretending and youre going to make it worse instead detach from emotion and think about what is it you want to do
4687337 mothers day is a day when children whatever age take the initiative so mothers day in a home where theres a divorce should be similar to mothers day in an intact family except without the participation of the father the children can draw a picture write a story or cook breakfast if theyre old enough to do so
4687338 what about the kids raising children before during and after divorce
4687339 the kids shouldnt be the ones solving the problem about what we do for different holidays
4687340 if he refuses to change the day the kids and mom should celebrate on their own on another day
4687341 id like to talk with you about mothers day is this a good time for you to talk
4687342 i think weve been doing a really good job handling our divorce in a way that makes our kids feel safe and loved
4687343 mothers day is coming up in three weeks the kids are scheduled to be with you and i would like to have some time with them my request would be to have the children for sunday morning brunch if you could help them with a card and gift i would really appreciate that and i would be happy to reciprocate for fathers day
4687344 the line for food or drinks at the reception is where i find to be the best place to mingle its there you have a kind of captive audience and can strike up a conversation about the bride or groom and your connection to them 2 try to find out any information about what single guys will be there weeks before the big day when the bride and groom arent so preoccupied people love to get involved in others love lives so dont be shy let them know youd be open to meeting someone find out from the bride or groom what single guys they think would be a good match for you 3 if the party is a sit down dinner ask them if it wouldnt be too much trouble to be placed at the same table as the single men at the reception you have to do this before they set their seating chart so the sooner the better 4 if its a buffet you can keep an eye out ahead of time for where to sit and just happen to be by that table where the cute guys are digging into their platters you can also offer to make a bar run for more champagne as thats usually very festive and welcome
4687345 a word or two slipped to the potential match this will set his wheels in motion so he will be thinking about the possibility before the party even starts 5 if youre in the wedding party this is even better because you have several chances to get to know the rest of the wedding party and if one just happens to be single and handsome well then the rest is up to fate
4687346 most people when attending weddings are more open and optimistic then they find themselves in their daily lives this accompanied with the celebratory atmosphere and in most cases alcohol can be a recipe that lowers inhibitions and occasionally impairs judgment sometimes when we are witnessing a union of two happy people we want to be a part of that good feeling so we go for a quick fix instead of investing time and energy into a courtship situation
4687347 the wedding was in maryland and i had to get a hotel room for the weekend i had just finalized my divorce and was feeling really vulnerable and a little lonely my cousin had this friend whom ive never met and we started dancing and talking and before i knew it i slipped him my room key after dinner it was fun at the time but looking back i hope i never see him again this is going to be sticky as my other cousins wedding is coming up from the same side of the family and im sure hell be there i wish itd never happened
4687348 i met my wife at our mutual friends wedding i made some lame joke during the cocktail hour and no one laughed except her i knew i wanted to talk to her more so i asked a friend to switch tables with me for the dinner after a few glasses of champagne and even more bad jokes we found out we both worked at the same hospital it was a no pressure fun way to meet someone new we were already there to have a great time so the pressure was off after my first marriage ended in divorce three years ago i thought that was it for me and id be married to the hospital for the rest of my life never say never i suppose
4687349 to know what you are eligible to receive is to complete the fafsa
4687350 families will sometimes mistakenly include the income information for both legal parents the fafsa is requesting information from just one parent
4687351 the financial aid office will likely choose whichever parent has the highest income
4687352 only one parents household income information is included on the fafsa so the student would likely use the information for the parent who is still around
4687353 i am pleased to announce that effective monday august 18 2008 the northampton county courthouse campus will embark on a vastly improved waste recycling program under this new system almost any item that passes through your hands on a daily basis can be recycled this new recycling program is called single stream which means that acceptable items in office areas can be placed in one container this effort will save at least 3 000 00 per year the courthouse complex alone presently deposits 50 to 60 tons of material in landfills per year other county buildings will be addressed in the near future
4687354 igotbay com and got bay clothing began as a clothing line and is growing into a community i believe that the bay area has got an unbelievable spirit that no other place has and i just wanted to create yet another way to express that please be on the look out for igotbay com in the coming years we have lots in store we are back and here to stay
4687355 imagine a world where technology helps solve the toughest problems facing us today
4687356 when you dont feel passionate about your career there may be a willingness to sabotage it with an office romance
4687357 when you get caught up in the romance you may find yourself thinking who cares if it ends badly and i lose my job ill just find another one if so my advice is to find a job you love and to do so on your own terms its better than taking the chance of being escorted out of your current job by the security staff however if you really love your career consider that when making a choice about whether to get romantically involved with a coworker the key here is to be aware of what is important to you and to make your choices from that place of awareness
4687358 there are faith issues that oftentimes leave one overwhelmed and feeling isolated and alone and estranged from their faith
4687359 most of the time temporary but it is another loss its an issue people struggle with when they are going through difficult times
4687360 when you think about all that attracts one to spiritual development abundant love peace of mind goodness healthy thoughts a better life the unhappiness of the divorce is the exact opposite of these good qualities and yet this is the time when the strength of spiritual development is most needed
4687361 because this spiritual thinking and living is taking priority over the messiness of the process
4687362 having spiritual thoughts as the focus of ones life regardless of events can actually set up a more harmonious order of things encourage solutions to apparent impasses and letting go of entrenched thinking which helps everyone involved
4687363 obviously the first thing that happens is its a sense of failure so people automatically think what did i do wrong why is this happening to me
4687364 why did this happen to you well why not you
4687365 learn something from everything unfortunately we learn our best lessons in pain
4687366 we separate from what we know is true and what we know is true is that god loves us all
4687367 we separate ourselves from god in the moment of that kind of adversity
4687368 the positive side of forgiveness we return to love and that is returning to god
4687369 you need to present a clear slate of what your motives are if you want your attorney to do an effective job they need the whole truth
4687370 once something is entered into the courts record or the judges memory it may be too late to correct
4687371 become reflective rather than reactive anxious people often dont hear what is said correctly nor do they articulate well
4687372 often parents keep a stiff upper lip and hold their grief in because they dont want their children to see them upset
4687373 modeling healthy ways to process your grief gives your children permission to feel their own pain
4687374 mommy is feeling really sad right now what i need is a five minute tickle fight
4687375 religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand
4687376 the first requisite for the happiness of the people is the abolition of religion
4687377 the basic idea is that god is some kind of spiritual narcotic that dulls our senses to the pain of the world and helps us to cope with it
4687378 religion opium of the people the true opium of modernity is the belief that there is no god so humans are free to do precisely as they please
4687379 the truth is something that cannot be changed god does exist he created us not the other way around
4687380 wishing all the boys a happy and safe raksha bandhan
4687381 during the day people who have chronic insomnia tend to fear going to bed because theyre thinking about lying in bed for hours on end trying to fall asleep so insomnia is a vicious cycle
4687382 research shows that your risk of diabetes increases if you get less than seven hours of sleep per night the risk is even higher if you sleep for five hours or less per night negative affects appear after only a brief period of sleep loss
4687383 interruption of regular breathing or obstruction of the airway of an individual during sleep can pose serious complications for the health of the individual sleep apnea should be taken seriously
4687384 when a man marries his mistress he creates a job vacancy
4687385 they have to be more creative than they might have previously
4687386 it was tough to make ends meet in the good times in one household its going to be impossible to make ends meet in bad times in two households
4687387 they have to be more creative than okay im going to buy you out and thats the end of it
4687388 come up with some ideas that will work with everyone
4687389 the last thing that someone wants to happen is to commit to something then find themselves behind the eight ball and be unable to fulfill their promises
4687390 of course you can even if it means getting a lawyer and calling the sheriff but usually you can find out why he wont move out and come to an agreement sometimes its financial he sees the house as at least half his and wont relinquish it that requires legal intervention sometimes is emotional
4687391 the commuter marriage keep your relationship close while youre far apart adams media april 2008
4687392 emotionally even though you have made it clear that you want him out hanging around where he is not wanted is just how it is the options are limited in his thinking either being alone which is scary or staying where he is its sad if you think about
4687393 try to find out what he needs in order to get him out if its to help him get an apartment and help him decorate it then do it of course you are enabling him but you are enabling him to be gone and you are willing to do whatever you need to get him gone
4687394 as a practitioner i advise if there are children involved that neither leave the marital home until there is a custody agreement in place if you are looking to share custody you dont want the perception that you are ready to leave until everything is in place
4687395 you cant get the spouse out of house unless you can prove there is some kind of danger
4687396 you can get exclusive occupancy during a divorce but it is very difficult emotionally and physically the courts dont like to kick people out of their houses
4687397 the best thing to do is book early as soon as the school calendar comes out thats the best time to go ahead and book your vacations for the upcoming school year if you wait too long flight availability will be gone
4687398 texture is key theres nothing like running your hand over a wall and experiencing a sensation
4687399 its a wall covering that looks like stone you can use it on walls floors countertops its fabulous
4687400 in a small space the light bounces all around and it really makes for a distinctive look
4687401 even if its just one wall you can give that room a beautiful focal point

4687405 people want more for their money they have to have more for their money and theyre having to be a little bit more creative on how theyre spending
4687406 they would normally put in yard sales but now you need to get some money out of what you have in your home
4687407 youre fulfilling the reuse part of reduce reuse and recycle
4687408 youre also probably getting a great deal on furniture that had you bought it new would have cost way more
4687409 i bought stuff that was still in the box from ikea people sold it because the item wasnt right for the space or they put it together and found it didnt fit
4687410 we put the word out between friends and family that we were moving into a new apartment
4687411 they just gave us stuff they never really had any reason to get rid of the furniture but now that i needed it it was a good excuse to get rid of it
4687412 if at the end you cant afford to store it then you can just give it away or put it back on the curb for the next curb shopper

4687419 whoever owns the policy controls the policy neither the beneficiary nor the insured have any say in who gets the proceeds at the death of the insured
4687420 only the owner dictates who the beneficiary is on a life insurance policy and that includes any beneficiary designations stipulated in a will
4687421 remember one of the main reasons you purchased life insurance in the first place was to provide financial security for your immediate family
4687422 if your children are young and or you dont trust the financial abilities of your soon to be ex spouse you can name a guardian of the property as a co beneficiary with your ex spouse who will get custody of the children
4687423 remember when selecting an amount that you will no longer have the other spouses assets and income
4687424 they can help ensure that the money is used to support your childrens needs
4687425 normal divorce settlements stipulate that the provider of alimony child support payments secure life insurance on their lives in an amount equal to the present value of future support payments that is done to protect the recipient of these support payments in the event of an untimely death
4687426 way too many times we see the owner of the life insurance policy be the provider of these payments not the recipient
4687427 this way you will know exactly what your payments will be the premiums will be the least costly and at the end of the 15 years you can cancel coverage
4687428 if youre suddenly in the unfamiliar position of having to make financial decisions on your own dont try a do it yourself approach the stakes are way too high especially if there are young children involved
4687429 i desperately wanted to be the mother i knew my children deserved above all i wanted asimple road map to get me through the challenges of divorce and single parenting successfully
4687430 the 7 pitfalls of single parenting what to do to help your children thrive after divorce
4687431 you have to re organize your life to fit a new picture
4687432 you need to help them feel secure by letting them know whats going to happen and as much as possible involving them in the decisions
4687433 right now things are pretty scary yes well have two different houses that we live in my vision is us as a happy joyful and strong family with lots of friends how can we build that
4687434 part of disengaging from your ex is accepting that what your ex spouse thinks of you is none of your business
4687435 if the dialogue starts to get personal redraw the boundaries and say you know what lets stay out of old territory
4687436 you want to be strong for your children and they have so many needs its easy to overlook taking care of yourself
4687437 your children wont appreciate you being endlessly self sacrificing be self respectful and take care of yourself first if you dont take care of yourself you wont have the energy and emotional capacity to give your kids what they need
4687438 you be the grown up deal directly with your ex and if you need to blow off steam talk to a friend or therapist well out of your childrens earshot
4687439 take yourself out of the middle of the equation by saying well dads not going to get the message unless he hears it from you
4687440 you have to put aside your bitterness and anger at your ex and work together to develop a system that will work for your children and make their transition between the two homes go as smoothly as possible
4687441 although mom and dad now live in different houses we are committed to loving you and will do the best we can to do whats best for you
4687442 if there are children involved overnight guests are a no no
4687443 children do not and should not have to deal with an endless stream of new dads or new moms if you want to have a sexual relationship with someone new thats ok just dont do it with the kids at home
4687444 children of any age are traumatized enough by the separation of their parents i know that a lot of my clients say but my kids are older and they understand about sex they know i like to have a sexual relationship while that might be true just remember the example that you are setting is that its ok to have sex with people you arent married to i think that is a bad example to set monkey see monkey do
4687445 its never a good idea but not even for the moral reasons or even the kids i am thinking of it from a litigious point of view we have had many cases that we have surveilled and that can be brought to light during the litigation and can jeopardize child support
4687446 you have to remember at least in california if you have someone stay overnight for three nights and they dont have to be consecutive that can be considered co habitating
4687447 i would caution the client in terms of custodial issues down the road that it is not good judgment if you start having a trail of people through your house
4687448 you are actually harming your child and i would be concerned if there were such issues between the parents that there was always going to be a concern about whether there could be good joint decision making regarding the kids
4687449 say you are with someone on a fixed basis you will be asked by a psychologist to bring that person in for an evaluation in child custody hearings
4687450 this person has to come in to be evaluated and we just had a case where an ex husband came back and contested because his ex wife hadnt told the truth about the fact she was dating one man and he had stayed over the house spent weekends together and the kids were in his constant company we had to reevaluate
4687451 for the control freak soon to be ex husband it can create heavy duty jealousy issues
4687452 im doing it im doing it i can do it
4687453 wait a minute ive been on this train too long to not be in berkeley yet
4687454 excuse me can you please tell me where i am
4687455 heres an interesting article describing the data management travails of banking securities financial services and technology company executives corporate data volume is doubling every two years keeping track of it all and handling discovery in the course of litigation is turning out to be a major issue
4687456 torear a mi aire ojal entren al trapo los enemigos sin ellos me quedo en nada
4687457 my first reaction is that two people marry for better or for worse
4687458 from a developmental psychology point of view marriage or partnerships dont work long term without commitment its about trust conditional commitment is not commitment if at the get go i tell you im outta here in 7 years why should either of us bother if the relationship is just for sex you dont need a commitment anyway marriages can fail for lots of reasons but if you arent willing to take the risk trust vulnerability and commitment why bother
4687459 let the winters come and go for all shall be well again i know all manner of things shall be well
4687460 one of the things that i find that is most happening in relationships that start to break down
4687461 is that people dont value how much whats going on in their minds what theyre saying to themselves is at play with how they take themselves away from their partners they think the opposite they think not telling whats really going on in their heads is helping the relationshiop what ive actually found that makes a huge difference is that level of vulnerability where you say what youre thinking and fearing and whats going on in your mind when people say that it makes all the difference with people wanting to be more intimate with each other integrity is telling the deep dark stuff youve been keeping to yourself for whatever reason
4687462 springtime could and might even save marriages because springtime brings out wanting to be in love and wanting to feel good about yourself and wanting to take off your clothes depending on where you live in the spring people want to feel in love and so i think it probably instigates an incredible amount of effort some people already realize somethings missing and want to fix it i think you can definitely feel it missing around springtime its beauitful out you should be happy during springtime and if youre not its probably more obvious than ever so if that inspires you to judge the quality of your relationship and do something about it i think it can help save your marriage
4687463 as the sun shines we begin to shed the layers of clothing that tend to hide us even from our romantic partners as we shed layers we often are reminded that physical fitness is appealing and sexy and we end up exercising more and eating less this fitness quest is naturally enhanced by the opportunity to be outside and moving around more so the spring season acts as a physical wake up call for many couples and as they begin to look and feel better they are likely to desire and make time for more physical intimacy in their lives
4687464 breaking off an affair can be just as difficult as breaking up a marriage depending on if there are emotions involved and how long it has gone on
4687465 however having an affair is never fair to the partner left in the dark
4687466 dont go into in depth details about why the affair cant continue the simpler and cleaner the break up is the better
4687467 im sorry i never should have done this its my fault but im ending it because i want to keep my marriage or the boss is suspicious or whatever take responsibility for having been irresponsible allow the other person a chance to be angry with you
4687468 resist the urge to explain why you are concluding the relationship
4687469 tell them in person and in public area where a scene is less likely to take place do not break off the affair at the office
4687470 and if possible relocate your desk and work space out of sight from the person with whom you fell into the affair with perhaps relocate to another department
4687471 dont allow your co worker affair to think there will be a chance of getting back together
4687472 do not waver or youll give your co worker the idea that pleading flirting cajoling or worse hysterics will win you back cut off all contact outside work no matter how well you do this there may be repercussions but being clear that its over and theres no chance for re starting will at least remove the idea that you can be coerced
4687473 bring yourself to love how couples can turn disconnection into intimacy
4687474 when you end an affair make it clear to your affair partner that you are ending it completely with no more friendship e mails or lunches be consistent if you waver look inside yourself and find out why
4687475 the most important quality matchmakers need to succeed is insight into their friends character and behavior getting you is more important than absolute detail about what youre seeking in a partner
4687476 throw in something cute about some of their quirks such as she cries at every romantic movie ive ever taken her to
4687477 affairs are the problem and symptom lets put it this way when there is a marital problem there are only so many ways to handle the problem
4687478 one way they choose to handle marital unhappiness is to have an affair so now the affair has become the problem
4687479 thats when no one talks no one talks about the 500 pound gorilla in the room they dont talk about what they should be talking about its basically a family that doesnt rock the boat
4687480 another way is for someone to have an affair its an escape valve an extra exit door that leads to only to corridor because it is not a real exit
4687481 it is really a myth that infidelity is a sign of a bad marriage
4687482 she interviewed a huge percentage of people who had affairs who said their marriages were not bad they actually had nothing to complain about
4687483 but most therapists do believe that it is a symptom of a bad marriage from my perspective maybe 30 to 40 percent of the time there are not significant problems in the relationship but i am not a researcher and not a clinician when i counsel people i tend to see the problems that might have led to the affair
4687484 there are lots of reasons but probably the most common reason is that people feel the need to be appreciated and have attention
4687485 so often our busy lives we take our spouses for granted we start out thinking the world of them but with careers and children our day to day existence gets pretty mundane
4687486 in a marriage you can tell someone you love them all day long verbally but if you dont demonstrate love they dont feel it its like the drunk at the bar telling everyone i really love my family but hes not home with them is he
4687487 if you dont know how to make that transition if you are expecting it to be automatic the way it was in dating you are bound to be disappointed a lot of couples dont know how to have sex and intimacy and that leaves a gaping hole that hole is a temptation to fill it with someone else and going back to the dating type sex that you already know
4687488 why do people have affairs if you want the opinion from a guy with a lot of degrees but who has gotten his doctorate on the streets ill tell you
4687489 guys want to have sex women need to be loved and emotionally given encouragement
4687490 this way mate they shoot you for going the other way
4687491 we cant stay here mate we have to move forward the sun will be up soon and john turk will be rabbit shooting all day long
4687492 wise men whose minds have become pure by washing away all the impurities accruing from attachment infatuation cravings etc and who have become free of all opposites like pleasure and pain can reach the highest place of god from where there is never any return
4687493 even though one is well versed in all the branches of knowledge he does not become fit for liberation unless he is a man of vairagya
4687494 because its one of the best vacation options to help keep unanticipated expenses to a minimum such as typical a la carte items like ground transportation meals and entertainment cruising may be more popular than ever in 2008
4687495 a lot of the underlying insecurity is that they are taking on the load of the divorce themselves theyre carrying so much of the baggage
4687496 if children are socially and emotionally fit they get through life better
4687497 one of the things that kids think when their parents divorce is they see their parents distraught theyre going through an incredible amount of pain and guilt and the kids dont want to add to it
4687498 what we need to do is to let them know their feelings are as important as ours we need an easy way to give them a release valve and express what theyre feeling and let them know that were not going to judge them or tell them everythings going to be okay but that were in this together and im going to support you and youre going to support me
4687499 its really important to share whats going on with people we trust
4687500 its vital for parents going through divorce to create a very comfortable very safe two way communication system
4687501 hed say mom and i had a fight the other day
4687502 they have rings to mark the engagement and rings to mark the marriage but none for the divorce why not
4687503 not many people liked that idea so i decided to go with no stones at all
4687504 cohabitation means less urban sprawl and softens the environmental hit
4687505 this party has become a tradition since my divorce i throw it every spring so we can all literally and figuratively clean out our closets
4687506 it grew into all my friends throwing all their unwanted memory tainted clothes into a pile on my living room floor we all try on each others clothes and whatever is left over in the pile i donate to a womans shelter
4687507 its the what if thoughts that are the hardest to deal with i call these clutter clusters if you havent used something in six months be ruthless and get rid of it
4687508 we use 20 percent of our possessions 80 percent of the time so put this 20 percent in the most accessible places treat yourself to storage items such as a filing cabinet a shoe rack or a pretty recycled paper box in which to keep sentimental items
4687509 people begin to own their own traditions interpret them wrestle with them morph them make them real to their own experience seder unites us the basic ritual unites us after that the meaning of it is completely open
4687510 something about this has touched a nerve with jewish women
4687511 we tend to hear only about history through the eyes and voices of men this is about filling in the blank spaces when i see the local grocery stores running low on oranges around passover ill know this tradition will be catching on
4687512 ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you
4687513 look unto me in every thought doubt not fear not
4687514 unfortunately there is nothing you can do to protect yourself emotionally once you discover your partner is leading a double life
4687515 if they are deceiving you your trust is being betrayed the only way to protect yourself from that is to be less trusting which has the negative effect of undermining the relationship and can then foster the cheating rather than preventing it however if you are also participating in the deceit through your own denial of recognizing inconsistencies in their behavior and faulty logic in their explanations then you have responsibility in the emotional distress you feel once their double life is exposed
4687516 money sex and kids stop fighting about the three things that can ruin your marriage
4687517 as a counselor it always puzzles me why wives and sometimes husbands can be so blind to whats going on
4687518 i think we see what we want to see and certainly in mrs cochrans case she was probably very comfortable and didnt want to rock the boat wives need to understand that sex is important to men especially wealthy and powerful men if hes not having much sex at home hes having it elsewhere also dont exclude yourself from his business life or his friends if you draw a sharp line around what you will and will not do youre liable to create a big space for someone else to move in dont think being married protects you from infidelity there are plenty of women out there who are willing to have sex with a married man dont get into the role of his surrogate mother nagging him cosseting him and whining or bitching at him you need to cultivate your status as his equal be inviting enough that hes open with you and keep your value in his eyes by maintaining a certain level of independence and autonomy
4687519 people who discover that their significant other has been unfaithful must be kind to themselves
4687520 its not their fault that their mate made the decision that he or she made it is important to have a safe place to talk and explore the wide range of feelings that will come up it could be a with a friend a family member or a therapist most times people find they feel better emotionally going to a therapist in these kind of situations because they find that their family member or friend is too close to the situation and has their own agenda making it hard for the person to get the true support that is needed i think that when there has been an infidelity in a relationship though painful it can be a chance to grow as a person individually and maybe as a couple there are definitely steps that can be taken to begin to repair the relationship if that is what is desired or to heal learn and grow if that is what is desired
4687521 if you and your spouse decide to recommit to your marriage and your spouse has agreed to sever all extramarital relations together you must begin the process of rebuilding the relationship couples therapy is necessary in that venture it is best to avoid talking about the intimate details of the affair with each other without the aide of a therapist because of the highly intense emotions that are involved your therapist will provide you with a safe and neutral environment helping you navigate through raw and painful emotions and guiding you to improved communication and understanding
4687522 dr eyring how many of these gentlemen believe in a supreme being
4687523 which best expresses your point of view that there is a supreme being or that there is not a supreme being
4687524 well dr eyring they tell me that what you do is put religion in one compartment and your science in another isnt that inconvenient for instance i want to propound a question to you in the young womens journal is reported to have said that people are living on the moon
4687525 now dr eyring we know there is no oxygen on the moon so that couldnt possibly be true what do you say to this question
4687526 and they all cried with one voice saying yea we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us and also we know of their surety and truth because of the spirit of the lord omnipotent which has wrought a mighty change in us or in our hearts that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually
4687527 wrought a mighty change in us or in our hearts that we have no more disposition to do evil but to do good continually
4687528 with a sincere heart with real intent having faith in christ
4687529 how do i know that the book of mormon is true
4687530 jack if you can understand what i am saying blink your eyes once
4687531 and it came to pass that the god of heaven looked upon the people and he wept and enoch bore record of it saying how is it that the heavens weep and shed forth their tears as the rain upon the mountains and enoch said unto the lord how is it that thou canst weep seeing thou art holy and from all eternity to all eternity
4687532 come listen to a prophets voice and hear the word of god
4687533 brothers and sisters i am sure many of you have had the experience of hearing people say that mormons are not christians because they have their own bible the book of mormon to anyone harboring this misconception we say that we believe in the lord jesus christ as our savior and the author of our salvation and that we believe revere and love the holy bible we do have additional sacred scripture including the book of mormon but it supports the bible never substituting for it
4687534 the only true god and jesus christ whom he hath sent
4687535 if the savior had overcome his trials could he help me overcome mine
4687536 is there a way to make the feature work on an entire project or solution

4687541 the abuse began in little ways nasty comments sarcasm insults and progressed finally to physical abuse after three or four years we had been in counseling and he promised never to hit me again he didnt but i didnt realize how emotionally and mentally abusive he could be
4687542 the judge in my case ruled that there had been no pattern of on going abuse only 1 instance of
4687543 i would eat poison just to spend days in the hospital away from the abuse dont fool yourself thinking it can be a one time thing it just doesnt happen that way
4687544 when denver was considering the financing to bring the colorado rockies baseball team to town i did a survey just for fun i wanted to see what the relationship was in the divorce rate between communities that had major league baseball teams and those that wanted them what i discovered was youre 28 percent more likely to get a divorce if you live in a town that wants a professional baseball team
4687545 baseball is something couples can do together for fun baseball is a family oriented activity unlike the theatre if you talk while youre at the theatre theyll kick you out but you can go to a baseball game and talk to your hearts content and nobody cares
4687546 there may be some lose coalition between divorce and baseball as far as the geographical factors are concerned but it almost like saying a lot of deaths occur in hospitals
4687547 that is just so funny tom and i just came back from a spring training game where the rays when the rays come here to charlottecounty were going to get box seats again
4687548 i would like to subscribe to the professors ideas about divorce and baseball but i have no idea about his scientific statistics i dont know if its done all that for our marriage i kinda like my husband a lot with or without baseball
4687549 what ive learned along with everyone else in this business is that people wait until their taxes are filed to get a divorce
4687550 their lawyer tells them they need financial information and suggest they wait until their taxes are filed once their taxes are filed that gives us a starting place it may not be 100 percent accurate but it still a good place to start
4687551 even in this day an age i had a women the other day that came in to see me about getting a divorce who told me i have no clue what my husband makes
4687552 thats not so strange because there are still women who take care of the house and kids and their husbands take care of the bills
4687553 i had a client who came in yesterday to see me with a joint tax return i took a look at it and told her you didnt tell me you owned property in florida her reply was i dont yes you do i told her according to your joint tax return
4687554 on tax returns today gambling winnings are shown casinos are required by law to report an individuals winning to the irs
4687555 this clients tax return showed that her husband had won substantial sums of money in los vegas i said to the wife you must have enjoyed going to vegas ive never gone to vegas i didnt know anything about my husband having been there before she told me
4687556 oftentimes id find that people who were trying to hid financial information would get an extension and delay filing their tax returns until oct 15 to avoid having to produce the damning evidence
4687557 ive been in the financial planning and tax business for 28 years and april 16 the day after taxes are due means nothing to me as far as an influx in divorces are concerned
4687558 this broad makes mensa member lots of luck lady youre gonna need it its females like this that gives decent ex wives a bad rap i suppose her next stop will be dr phil a few years down the line when nobody will date her
4687559 everyone in this modern day wants their 15 minutes of fame this may be her way of getting it its also part of todays social networking everyone is always plugged in all the time people who go on myspace and blog can quickly have 200 friends this is how people today choose to connect to each other its a very human emotion people crave connections well do anything we can do to get them this is the latest rendition of how people chose to connect to each other
4687560 what she has accomplished by doing what she did is that she is showing the world she has a huge amount of pain there are probably some psychological issues going on too but it doesnt help her with her case her husband is going to walk away from all this publicity better off than she is the method she is using taints her message
4687561 she could be doing herself a great disservice by attempting to humiliate him and bring scorn on him on youtube that could open her up to liability depending on state law
4687562 with all this technology from twitter to youtube if she had gotten her husband on camera promising to take care of her financially for life then the technology might have been useful
4687563 unfortunately today many people are living their lives online she undoubtedly has a lot of bitterness going through a divorce and she wants the whole world to know about her troubles psychologically she has a lot of rage and she wants to get back at the other person its a terribly unfortunate way to handle things when people actively try to hurt someone else it usually always backfires it never works out
4687564 he will probably be very hurt and he may want revenge himself it may make it almost impossible for him to trust another person of the opposite sex in our culture we dont know how to handle situations like this its very very sad its also very futile and pointless
4687565 has complicated her whole situation whatever way she had for communicating with her husband in a rational way has been violated at this point his guard is going to be up any chance she had of private litigation she has thrown out the window
4687566 theyll be so happy at that point they didnt hand out their first attempt
4687567 the best thing you can do in a situation like this initially is do nothing your initial response is probably not the response you want to put out to the world
4687568 shes a stupid bimbo who married for money and got nothing
4687569 its fair she thought she was going to marry into a gold mine i think she went on youtube because she wanted to be heard she did it to humiliate the other side but it backfires because it only humiliates her
4687570 its important to educate consumers in how to make a wise choice when hiring a personal coach
4687571 that guarantees confidentiality and means they have pledged to act only in your best interest
4687572 its important that there be good chemistry between you because that allows trust
4687573 because of my job i have to be very outgoing and accommodating plus i work in extremely social situations so meeting men was a non issue im very independent and consider myself to be a fairly good judge of character so when this happened more than once i got really confused it just seems that as soon as i returned their affections the phone calls would stop i couldnt count on the guy for saturday nights anymore and id basically get pushed aside these were the same men who ardently pursued me just a few months ago then as soon as id let it go or make a date with another guy theyd come back even stronger i just dont get it i felt like i was on a hamster wheel
4687574 if the divorce is simple and uncontested meaning both spouses agree and there are no assets no children and no spousal support issues a dedicated detail oriented and persistent person with lots of time might actually be able to figure out the process
4687575 divorces are easier in a state like california which is very form oriented
4687576 the forms and instructions can be confusing so for questions call the court while the court cannot give you legal advice they may be able to provide helpful answers to procedural questions
4687577 when parents trained each other they actually did better than many low charging lawyers
4687578 call the local court to see what kind of help is available
4687579 in california some lawyers will provide unbundled services meaning you only pay the lawyer to do one or more specific aspects of your case
4687580 if you have limited resources that is one possible way of getting help you desperately need while still representing yourself on the less complicated issues
4687581 and if you cannot even find the money for a consultation at least visit the family law facilitator in the courthouse or a legal clinic something to get advice from a lawyer
4687582 do not settle for a document preparer or a paralegal talk to a lawyer
4687583 in states like california where i practice this is provided by case law and statute so that for example if the spouse with a job and income leaves the other spouse who is left without job or income can ask the court to order the affluent spouse to pay his her fees and costs so as to level the playing field and equalize access to the courts
4687584 my firm charges 349 plus court fees for a simple uncontested divorce
4687585 many other lawyers charge 1 500 for contested divorces our hourly rate is 125 about half the price of the average new york lawyer
4687586 many couples tend to argue about money its quite common
4687587 its also common for a spender to marry a saver after all opposites attract originally they may have respected the quality that the other had but often over time they become adversarial about it
4687588 the solution is to reach a compromise where both partners have to rethink their behavior
4687589 if you can agree on a splurge category like a vacation thats actually an incentive
4687590 savers arent necessarily scrooge and spenders arent necessarily out of control
4687591 actually these two can really complement each other with the saver helping the couple create a financially sound future and the spender helping them enjoy the present and make the most of their spending dollars
4687592 both parties should be made aware of the couples financial assets and debts
4687593 there are several ways to do this depending on the personalities involved
4687594 one partner can compensate for earning less by taking on more domestic responsibility this is how a family with children often works where the homemaking parent not always the mom these days often earns less but does more housework and childcare
4687595 as long as no one is overdrawing an account or a credit card and bill paying and savings are covered by the joint account
4687596 concerned about who spends more on clothes and who spends more on meals out
4687597 dating for dads the single fathers guide to dating well without parenting poorly
4687598 but this time i was a widowed and divorced woman
4687599 dating after marriage is certainly not the experience that it was before marriage
4687600 in a sense newly single people are looking to prove to themselves that someone can be attracted to them as a result they are just not ready for a serious committed relationship
4687601 i was so caught up in the ensuing whirlwind that i became oblivious
4687602 mom theres a man in the kitchen and hes wearing your robe
4687603 as a widow dating i had been trusting naively assuming that all marriages were like my first one
4687604 as a divorced woman i spotted red flags even before a guy split the check for a cup of coffee
4687605 when one ex starts dating and the other is not emotionally ready it can be very traumatic and trigger feelings of anger bitterness sadness and jealousy
4687606 breakthrough for a broken heart and adultery 101 reasons not to cheat
4687607 live your life your way on your terms and dont compare yourself with others
4687608 these feelings are emotionally destructive and prohibit you from moving forward
4687609 in california adultery doesnt make a bit of difference in division of property judges dont get into it often people are very disappointed to hear that
4687610 you can put yourself in a better position and bargain for more favorable terms if you know how to go about it
4687611 dont wait until the cheater cleans out the bank account and leaves or youll lose your chance to gain the upper hand if you suspect that something might be going on be smart and quietly go about getting some of the details
4687612 technology is having a big impact on the way that divorces are now conducted
4687613 many people still dont realize how much with 82 percent citing it as the main source
4687614 letting your spouse know youre aware of their affair may make the difference between being dumped and negotiating for more favorable terms
4687615 if you do decide to pursue this avenue you will have to keep quiet as you are learning about the affair otherwise you will lose your bargaining power
4687616 even if you have a video of your husband and his secretary going into a hotel room that doesnt mean youve proven anything
4687617 that cuts both ways we can perceive that they are fighting harder
4687618 but then people in a high wealth case might be fighting harder
4687619 if you are just joe average the only one who is going to read it is going to be the judge
4687620 celebrities probably behave differently because they dont want things played out and made public
4687621 we as the public realize that these people are not gods they are not superhuman they go through their bad times like everyone else
4687622 the most valuable asset generally is their good name and they will do all they can to protect and promote it
4687623 certainly money will solve a lot of problems and celebrities will pay more if it means getting a desired result quickly and without adverse publicity
4687624 they have ability to use press agents to spin their stories
4687625 sometimes that results in a media blitz that unfortunately affects the publics perception of their case
4687626 the media blitz can become harmful to the children of that divorcing couple because they are celebrities and the school playground can become a savage place
4687627 if both parties are celebrities it is even worse because of the time demands of filming on location
4687628 home interest property taxes and equity are the three main tax issues related to selling a home its important to look at the long term consequences of selling or keeping the home
4687629 may be a wake up call to see how a home that was paid for by two people can or can not be supported by one income
4687630 if both parties are in agreement on sales price and any contract issues repairs closing date etc then things can go fine
4687631 if both owners cant agree it can end up in a legal mess
4687632 sometimes in an emotional issue such as divorce people are scared so they go talking to the first person they meet and that person might not necessarily have the same financial priorities or sensitivity to help with a particular situation
4687633 most divorce attorneys arent familiar with the tax laws that can save their clients money
4687634 the rules for a primary residence are if you sell it as a married couple the first 500 000 of capital gains is tax free its 250 000 for a single person
4687635 it is very clear that restraining orders are being used inappropriately
4687636 it is almost impossible to defend a man accused of domestic assault as it is politically incorrect to even question a woman who has accused a man of domestic violence
4687637 my son just turned 11 and my daughter will soon be 15 i havent seen them since they were 4 and 8
4687638 during the divorce she admitted there was never any violence between us but in an effort to halt visitation which even the judge admitted she was trying to do and for no good reason she punched me on the forehead as hard as she could hoping i would hit her back i didnt
4687639 the resulting restraining order was only between me and her and did not involve the children which i welcomed because it would prevent her from instigating violence once again nevertheless having this incident on record later helped her achieve her goal of eliminating me from their lives
4687640 the loss of an important relationship like a marriage can be very difficult for anyone but it appears that men are more likely to get depressed whereas women suffer more financial hardship initially
4687641 such substantial loss can trigger a depressive episode in vulnerable individuals or depressive symptoms could have exacerbated the marital dissolution which then get worse when the marriage is over
4687642 mens social lives largely revolve around their spouses and family and when that is disrupted it can leave men more isolated and prone to depression
4687643 i definitely could have perceived this has a i have failed
4687644 i could spend all of my time looking back and second guessing things after a separation it seems like all of the past comes into question so many hurtful things come out
4687645 i would like to use this as an opportunity to become the best me i can be
4687646 one of the challenges we had as a family was that we often changed our plans around our kids plans
4687647 it is a real blessing for them to see that their parents are real adults who need to have adult lives
4687648 my kids really love the one on one time with each of us
4687649 i am in no rush to move on with things
4687650 someone who can combine the toughness they are used to with the negotiating adeptness they believe a woman would bring to the office
4687651 obama represents a serious challenge because at least for the moment he represents something big an inspiration movement
4687652 all of these articles about his boyhood in indonesia and his life in hawaii are geared toward showing his background is diverse multicultural and putting that in a new light
4687653 save it for 2050 it also exposes a very strong weakness for him his roots to basic american values and culture are at best limited
4687654 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4687655 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4687656 bo may well outpace hrc or at least keep even in fundraising
4687657 we have a great deal of support in the party and across the nation but we need to energize it more lets talk more about a movement for change coming from the people
4687658 when you strip away those voters who are voting on race or gender this election is not about change not about experience but about leadership
4687659 the idea that this can be won all on smiles emotions and empathy is simply wrong this can be won on the basis of presidential leadership tempered by showing the other human side through counter tv appearances some home visits and events that keep this tethered to helping people not ambition
4687660 show that their image of obama camelot is simply nothing but campaign pitter patter
4687661 he is just words and she is a lifetime of action
4687662 she is the one who is ready to fill the big shoes of this job and he is an inspiring speaker who isnt
4687663 i believe we should reach out to be as likeable as possible
4687664 but reach too far in this dimension and you risk really getting into gore and kerry territory
4687665 these are sophisticated buyers they have they know full well that they were going to saturate the florida market
4687666 both hillary and gore are suberb smart caring politicians both let their essential soul to be sucked dry by consulting morons
4687667 if hrcs handlers allowed to be hillary clinton and not some concoction of a phony thatcher or whomever she might have had a chance that she allowed those highly paid fakes to make her into a fake is what disqualified her
4687668 i have had the feeling for a while now since the bereaved are taking the loss so hard that they fell in love with her as first lady like women do with a movie star
4687669 see that guy over there in that cell its his turn to go home first bring it on baby im staying at the hanoi hiltion
4687670 clinton s campaign acknowledged that it s not possible to buy 49 state coverage
4687671 start an audience responsive riff what is it going to take to get it done experience
4687672 it will be very interesting to see what the mccain campaign can do with the contents of these memos
4687673 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4687674 it was disgusting how the obama campaign played the race card and tried to destroy anyone who dared question his presidential credentials i e geraldine ferraro
4687675 in military strategy there is a powerful dictum nothing fails like success
4687676 obama may have succeeded in stealing the nomination from hrc but there is no way in hell he can defeat john mccain and the legions of loyal hrc supporters
4687677 having contributed time and money to the clinton campaign i now vehemently support john mccain
4687678 that mark penn how could he say those mean things
4687679 where are my people going i must find out so that i can lead them
4687680 penn advised that clinton attack obama as just words a very similar tact to the one successfully adopted by john mccains campaign in recent weeks
4687681 at the seminar i was saying that im always so nice and how i say yes when i really want to say no
4687682 the leader said to me oh so youre someone who doesnt honor yourself it was like a knife went through my heart
4687683 the reasons that people give for staying in a marriage are almost always a lie
4687684 they stay because theyre afraid of the unknown of change
4687685 when people cannot see options they feel hopeless and are much more inclined to give up
4687686 i would tell myself that my husband wouldnt be able to make it without me and that my son although in his twenties would be upset
4687687 and lastly because almost everyone else in my life was divorced i would say that i wanted to be the one who could make it work
4687688 my husband could be very stern and opinionated and the way he spoke to me was very demeaning
4687689 every time we interacted in these unpleasant ways i would tell myself that nothing was worth my staying wed become so estranged and i was lonely that made me want to leave and all of this made it difficult to stay or to buy into my excuses
4687690 and most of us dont want to be single so its easy to stay in a crummy marriage however in my experience being in a bad marriage is draining demoralizing and depressing
4687691 if you are sure that the marriage is over remember its easier to leave at 33 than 43 and easier to leave at 43 than 53 leave now while there is more time to create the life you want to live
4687692 thirty years ago it was much harder to get sex you had to sneak around and really look for it cybersex brings it right into the house it is just so easy now
4687693 the only difference is at a bar you actually see and talk to a person in the flesh when you go on the internet you are getting a connection with a person in the machine and its really a fantasy to have an affair on a machine it is not real
4687694 you could enter it innocently not really looking for an affair but its very seductive so even a little curiosity can get you hooked while the fantasy aspect is alluring it can also lead to misrepresentation even without intent
4687695 online affairs represent safety fantasy and that big escape tunnel they dont count because there is no one to one contact because they are viewed as a so called emotional timeout its like the guys who go online for pornography the internet has created a powerful outlet for an already existing problem people think its safer its very easy to fool yourself by fooling your spouse honey its not like i am meeting him its only online what is the big deal
4687696 if a man is curious about threesomes for instance and doesnt talk to his wife about it because he thinks she wouldnt handle it well he goes on one of the alternative sex sites where he will find a chat room that is free or low fee in his mind this is a safe cheap alternative he doesnt know these people he will never meet them and there he can connect up with people and talk about his fantasies
4687697 but pretty soon he finds someone he really connects with and off they go from the group on their own it just moves like that
4687698 we just dont have a heavy investment in the kids
4687699 the relationship with the father declines normally just in the natural course of things
4687700 finding alone time with any one of them takes planning and effort
4687701 the other obstacle is self doubt not knowing or believing that what i plan or if its just hanging out is good enough
4687702 mothers may find it impossible to contain the hurt rage they experience as a result of the change in their financial status and increased amount of responsibility for childrearing
4687703 if i am not careful about the contact i have with their mother meaning if i let myself get too close my feelings of hurt and anger come up and it keeps me from being present with the kids
4687704 and as adults have a harder time claiming their identity and forming sustained intimate relationships
4687705 if the mother is supportive shell push from her end
4687706 shari i know i want tonight to be the night but how do i come prepared without seeming presumptuous
4687707 these days the trend in fashion is a big bag anyway
4687708 in fact the bigger the better there are so many styles out there with a great range of prices a fantastic way to check out the latest trends and try them on for size before buying is to go online to bagborrowandsteal com you can rent a designer bag for weeks or months at a time its one way to experiment with the size of bag that feels right for you before dropping a paycheck on a top designer
4687709 i called my partners and said i think i just met a future president of the united states
4687710 i went from being a senator a young senator to being considered for vice president running for president being a vice presidential candidate and becoming a national public figure
4687711 all of which fed a self focus an egotism a narcissism that leads you to believe that you can do whatever you want youre invincible and there will be no consequences
4687712 he could have been a force in american politics for a very long time
4687713 the fact that he had not spent his life in politics was his greatest asset people at the time were saying he didnt have enough experience and hadnt been tested actually hed been tested in ways other people had not
4687714 if youre an incumbent one of your nightmares is a fresh face coming out of the woodwork with the resources to be competitive
4687715 has shown a remarkable disrespect for his office for the moral dimensions of leadership for his friends for his wife for his precious daughter
4687716 i suspect the first thing he thought about is im going to protect myself politically he was worried about his family finding out he was worried about the rest of the staff finding out he was worried about the press finding out
4687717 consistent moderation placed edwards among the center right of senate democrats
4687718 he climbed onto the slab at the funeral home laid there and hugged his body and promised that hed do all he could to make life better for people to live up to wades ideals of service
4687719 as he told me later edwards had recounted the exact story to him almost in the exact same words a year or two before and with the same preface that hed never shared the memory with anyone else
4687720 he wanted to be vice president and said what he had to
4687721 the thing that would surprise me is if he doesnt continue to serve in some way hes been underestimated many times
4687722 im not sure i had a political career for the future anyway
4687723 im not sure that politics was what i wanted to spend my life doing
4687724 i dont know whats possible and whats gone i dont think anythings ended i see no end my lord and my wife have forgiven me so im going to move on
4687725 i dont have an answer why more women get divorces than men in the military i only have numbers
4687726 it wasnt until my report came out in 2007 about divorce in the military that we learned that divorce in the military was substantially higher among females than males this has been true for more than the last decade even when there was no war going on
4687727 one thought is that support services available for military families are geared for supporting civilian wives of male servicemen
4687728 another possibility is that women who are service members are different than men in the military in important ways it has been said that the military recruits the most traditional men in our society but the military recruits the least traditional females in our society they are not the women who are most invested in the general role assigned to women a third possibility is that it may be more stressful to be a civilian husband of a military wife than it is to be a civilian wife of a military husband we dont know the answers but we recommend there needs to be more research done on women in the military
4687729 the highest divorce rate was among navy personnel in 2006 that service had a divorce rate among its married personnel of 3 4 percent
4687730 we found no spike in marital breakups among members of the military including those that deployed to iraq and afghanistan military families certainly face high levels of stress but thus far it has not resulted in similarly high rates of divorce
4687731 our dependence on foreign oil means that we are buying from our enemies
4687732 how bout some friends and a few a holes that better
4687733 the american people know something is wrong as far as energy is concerned
4687734 i hope he grabs that part of middle america that we failed to reach
4687735 i want him to make more money in wind than he did in oil
4687736 it was my first experience in the takeover field expansion by acquisition
4687737 people had splashed water all over the counters thrown paper towels on the floor and boone pickens couldnt stand to see his investment in disarray so without a word he started picking up the paper towels and wiping down the counters himself
4687738 i think the rest of us were so embarrassed we started to clean up quietly around him
4687739 but then i found out that she and my husbands attorney hated each other
4687740 i kind of liked it that it rankled my husband i didnt want to make the whole thing easier for him and felt who is he to tell me what to do
4687741 what usually happens is the reverse and it is the lawyers who make it so if the lawyers are contentious between themselves that contentiousness bleeds into the case because if the lawyers dont like or trust each other things cannot be done on a handshake on a calm basis to move the case forward
4687742 lawyers are supposed to act as buffers between their clients if i have a cooperative relationship with the opposing counsel i get the best results for the client with least amount of cost
4687743 if the other side just wants to battle it creates acrimony and that acrimony is counterproductive what we are tying to do is split up their stuff and work with issues of custody and support of the kids it doesnt facilitate that at all if i dont trust the other lawyer or get papered to death
4687744 its very costly and we are the ones making the money
4687745 i fell into a coma two days later and literally was unconscious for two months
4687746 he was not there he never sent a card he never called my family and in the meantime i lost custody of my kids he moved back into the home basically when i finally woke up from the coma i had nothing
4687747 it was after i began to regain my health that he insisted on a guardian ad litem to evaluate me as a capable parent
4687748 it seemed he suddenly questioned my motives as a caring and loving mother once he left our home he seemed to have a laundry list of items that caused him to question my commitment as a mother mainly that i worked outside the home and traveled some for business ironically it never came up as a significant problem when we were married i believe he was thinking hoping i would not regain my health
4687749 once i was well enough i moved back to an apartment in concord and saw my kids every afternoon and i was finally granted primary custody
4687750 most courts in the u s use a best interest of the child standard a parent without custody needs to prove the status quo is not in the best interest of the child and the arguments you use have to be tailored to the age and situation of the child
4687751 i believe we would have won iowa and clinton today would therefore have been the nominee
4687752 i went to the wilmington del post office on march 20 2008 at 12 p m i talked to employee john smith and inquired about a forwarding address mr smith was not able to give me a forwarding address on march 20 2008 at 5 p m i called my spouses sister name and inquired about my spouses location i didnt get any new information on where my spouse might be
4687753 on march 28 2008 i knocked on the door and asked if john q absent was there the person who answered door said john had lived here for five years but he didnt know where he was now
4687754 was the kindest most generous most loving companion any woman ever had
4687755 i was plunged into a state of unreality as soon as the words its over left his mouth
4687756 it was as though the words took form in the air like little marble blocks and then crumbled to dust on the ground like in a cartoon
4687757 runaway husbands making sense and bouncing back from a divorce you didnt see coming
4687758 i thought we had finally found a place that was comfortable for both of us surprise was my first response then there was just emptiness
4687759 historically men are more likely to suddenly leave their spouse however as women have made gains in the workplace have more status and financial opportunity to leave it is becoming more common for them to leave as well
4687760 my mind was spinning trying to absorb how it was possible that he had lied to me for so long that he had lived a double life
4687761 men are more likely to leave suddenly especially when they have a new relationship they are going to they usually see it as an escape from whatever challenges their marriage is facing
4687762 if mama is not happy then nobody is happy my daughter was the youngest of four and the only one still at home by the time that she was 13 she had already given us more trouble than the three boys combined
4687763 i just had to get out of there i was just getting too old to listen to it once i left i sure did appreciate coming home to peace and quiet
4687764 we got married too young i had realized for years that i no longer had a companion or best friend in the marriage she did what she wanted to do i did what i wanted to do and it was rarely the same thing as we got older we didnt even watch the same tv shows we had nothing in common but the boys
4687765 i realized that i did not need to make a decision quickly after a while i simply accepted it as inevitable it was no longer an emotional issue for me
4687766 she was a gentle person and i knew that if i left earlier when i wanted to the two boys would run all over her so i waited until they were out of the house
4687767 i have had clients who have talked about waiting until their kids go to college so that they can leave their spouses since they do not want to disrupt their kids lives while they are at home
4687768 i knew that my leaving would be hard for her no matter when i left i knew i would never be happy with her so there was nothing to discuss i started a savings account for her and she could have the house there was more than a hundred thousand dollars of equity in it
4687769 strange now that when i look back the emotional pain has long healed
4687770 but i still remember shaking in my boots when it dawned on me that to i needed to make some drastic changes if i wanted to raise my eleven year old daughter and at the same time not lose our home
4687771 and most people dont confront it until after the actual separation
4687772 grieving the loss of a marriage is much like grieving the death of a loved one on top of all this emotional turmoil you suddenly find yourself facing financial problems as well
4687773 i loved the time i spent with my daughter and now i was dropping her at one friends house picking her up and dropping her off somewhere else and then rushing off to my next job i was working an accounting job got licensed to sell real estate and was working nights to sell mary kay cosmetics life was a three ring circus for a couple of years theres just no other way to describe it
4687774 youre not emotionally prepared to do the things to stay solvent and yet in order to survive you must but stretching your income by running up your credit cards catches up to you in a hurry
4687775 credit is not income it is future income that youre indebting
4687776 maybe its for a week or a month but locking up the credit cards for a period of time is often a valuable first step in controlling your money
4687777 when the friendship interferes with your relationship at home thats an emotional affair
4687778 in an emotional affair you check out mentally from the marriage you are mentally gone because you are so busy wrapped in what this other person is doing thinking and feeling you are making decisions based on how the other person will feel about them emotional affairs are very dangerous they really are because often you dont know you are in one until it is too late
4687779 the madonna and alex rodriguez situation is a public announcement of a private situation and we are hearing one of three sides to a story we dont know if alex and madonna were having an affair of any kind but we do know that most men and women would not appreciate their mate slipping in and out of another persons home at any time let alone after midnight
4687780 money sex and kids stop fighting about the three things that can ruin your marriage
4687781 the issue is disrespect toward your wife and family you can have an innocent crush on someone and it doesnt need to become disrespectful married people especially parents need to grow up emotionally and learn self control if youre a celeb and acting in ways the paparazzi can document as out of bounds thats not respectful to your wife and family
4687782 there is some blockage already in the marriage you take each other for granted and that is where the whole thing begins
4687783 you find a connection with this other person there is a thing that happens in your head where you start to believe that this other person is so much better than your spouse in various ways when that comparison thing happens that is the moment of betrayal after a while part of you is actively withheld from your spouse and reserved only for this other person
4687784 emotional affairs are often first steps out of the existing relationship they can rob the current relationship of richness and chances for happiness
4687785 any life change is anxiety and stress producing but divorce is one of the worst because it creates an unknown unpredicted situation with lots of insecurity low self esteem and fear
4687786 acute stress disorder is a normal response to a really shocking traumatic event if youre going through a divorce its very normal and appropriate to have several weeks where you cant sleep cry a lot or feel frightened angry hurt sad scared and abandoned
4687787 when someone is facing a major life change it can be frightening and full of unknowns so a whole range of emotions are brought to surface and its normal to feel anxious
4687788 ask yourself is this thought im having right now a productive thought is it helping me in any way what would help me
4687789 when were stressed all the things we normally do to help us feel good like exercising eating well and socializing are often the first things to go by the wayside those are the very things that people need to do to keep stress at bay
4687790 exercise is critical because it increases your serotonin and your sense of well being youre not going to feel like doing it but once youre there you will feel better afterward
4687791 tensions and hostilities between georgians and ossetians are in no way justification for russian troops crossing an internationally recognized border
4687792 russia to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its forces from the territory of georgia
4687793 the consequences for euro atlantic stability and security are grave
4687794 talks among all sides and said the united states the u n security council and other parties should try to help bring about a peaceful resolution
4687795 its both sides fault both have been somewhat provocative with each other
4687796 central front in their war against america and the home of the next caliphate
4687797 today the united states has no moral authority left whatsoever to talk about human rights and the respect of law
4687798 bullshit youre doing a circle jerk with your righty friends because you think its safe here
4687799 once we decide to put some muscle into the game the entire american narrative is nothing more than mythology
4687800 i pray that god heals everybody and replaces stupidity with wisdom
4687801 in 2008 we have a choice between 1 a man who defines evil by throwing in the bible and therefor thinks to know evil and repudiates it and 2 a man who believes that there is fault on both sides and that institutions like the united nations that are discredited by believing the lies the us told them weapons of mass destruction my a should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4687802 should again be better equipped to deal with disputes among sovereign nations than the nations themselves
4687803 whats the point of having this great military if you never use it
4687804 poland is making itself a target this is 100 percent
4687805 it becomes a target for attack such targets are destroyed as a first priority
4687806 against the allies of countries having nuclear weapons if they in some way help them
4687807 character assassination to silence an effective leader of the political opposition
4687808 the un secretary general has not uttered a word meaning that he respects our laws and justice system why should a lesser mortal from the us say that malaysia is not up to their standards
4687809 why should gore and the us president give their evaluation of a country does he not know the meaning of the udhr universal declaration of human rights and the un charter respect for the internal affairs of a country
4687810 but if they have any substantive legal problem that they would like to highlight internationally they are welcome to discuss it with us but in a manner that is judicious careful and respectful
4687811 could easily be described as hell so hot so deadly that only a handful of the teeming billions now alive will survive
4687812 with an almighty crash the ice split right between my feet and a 300 tonne block broke off fortunately i fell on to the main part of the chunk but now it started turning round so i ended up in the water i began swimming around the chunk hoping to find a point of access to the ice there was none i was not afraid of being so close to drowning but of deserting inge and our two kids and i was furious at having agreed to do the job without proper surveillance
4687813 the benefits of strong and early action far outweigh the economic costs of not acting
4687814 a degree of warming that would surely yield dangerous climate impacts
4687815 sea level changes of several metres per century occur in the palaeoclimate record in response to forcings slower and weaker than the present human made forcing this indicates that the ice may disintegrate and melt faster than previously assumed and that the warming may be delayed less by the ice than assumed
4687816 if humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilisation developed and to which life on earth is adapted palaeoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that co2 will need to be reduced from its current 385ppm to at most 350ppm
4687817 low cost solar power geothermal energy some non intrusive climatic engineering or genetically engineered carbon eating trees
4687818 that about 8 of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is absorbed by vegetation and returned to the atmosphere every year
4687819 both obama and mccain need to make their running mate choices very carefully because after all the influence that cheney and gore developed people are going to analyze their choices very carefully
4687820 we will never go back to the days when the vice presidency held little influence the national government is involved in too many things for a president not to have a strong partner standing at his side
4687821 even selecting himself as the running mate something that has never been done in history
4687822 theres something healthy in the vice presidency becoming a separate entity
4687823 in the next month one man either the democratic presidential nominee or the republican presidential nominee will choose the next vice president of the united states
4687824 their choice will be ratified by their party conventions and we the people will accept it but the idea that one person will select somebody who has a one in three chance of becoming president of the united states is to my mind very problematic
4687825 presidential candidates usually get vetted for a couple of years but the vice president just gets picked by one guy
4687826 its kind of weird process if you stop and think about it
4687827 it ought to be a more competitive process at the early stages
4687828 maybe people should run for vice president i dont know but we should be talking about it because the process now is fundamentally unhealthy it is not democratic for one man or woman to be able to pick the next president of the united states
4687829 my parents put me on my first diet when i was in seventh grade it was atkins i still have the book
4687830 i was trying to lose weight for all the wrong reasons
4687831 my husband said that he didnt want to be married to a fat wife
4687832 as soon as i made the change from diet to lifestyle i started to lose weight
4687833 when i found out that i wasnt the only person who had eaten half of a pint of ice cream in one sitting i felt much better
4687834 while ending a marriage is painful it is also a new beginning many people see weight loss as a way to reclaim their health and vitality
4687835 there is an emotional side to eating eating can provide comfort lessen anxiety and even soften anger during a time of emotional turmoil and distress food can seem like a friend
4687836 we know that cortisol our stress hormone helps the body to prepare for emergencies by storing up energy
4687837 chronic stress can also add to weight gain by exaggerating this response
4687838 one major trend we have seen is going green and being eco friendly
4687839 lots of bold colors make functional storage another way to express personality
4687840 definitely we are moving toward what we are calling alternative art work
4687841 they can hang the panels over the screen its all about personalization
4687842 these products are great quality so something can last four years and beyond to the first apartment
4687843 john edwards had everything to lose but he still went ahead and did it
4687844 if he had been the democratic nominee the party would be in shambles
4687845 you wonder why someone like that didnt take that into account
4687846 he didnt look at the costs the costs for him were astronomical and he still did it its consistent with male behavior generally
4687847 so what did you do last night the economics of infidelity
4687848 it does say that biology has a lot to do with the way we operate
4687849 how you respond to those urges though its a conscious decision
4687850 but she was older her biological clock was ticking it made her a very good candidate
4687851 shes already a successful person she may not be looking for a mate heres a person who is unavailable for marriage what would she be looking for shes successful she doesnt need money good genes is what shes looking for
4687852 john edwards shows a lot of signs of being of good genetic quality
4687853 theyd be in high demand and if theyre in high demand theyre much more willing to cheat
4687854 why is it that high profile males get caught up in these situations high profile males have more opportunity
4687855 we are not going to base our campaign on the concerns of so called campaign strategists on cable tv
4687856 the price mccain paid for his partys nomination has been to reverse himself on position after position
4687857 that doesnt meet my definition of a maverick you cant be a maverick when politically its important for you but not a maverick when it doesnt work for you
4687858 weve been through two very tough elections at the national level and its very easy to lose confidence
4687859 if somebody attacks you you have to frame the attack this is the same old politics or better yet the bush rove politics
4687860 at the same time you do that you have to counterattack you dont want to look like a whiner you want to look tough
4687861 when i tried to sell the ring back to the jewelry store they wanted to give me 35 percent of what i paid for it
4687862 i wanted nothing to do with it so i stuck it in a drawer
4687863 i think it is popular just because a lot of people in the same situation as was and are not sure what to do with the ring
4687864 the difference between our site and e bay is that we verify the rings before they are shipped out and any money is exchanged we have an in house jeweler
4687865 i went to two places in westchester and two places in manhattan and either the jeweler didnt want the ring or would take it and not give me any money until it sold one jeweler wanted to recut it the best offer i got was like 3 000 and i just got fed up
4687866 within two weeks it sold for 5 000 and i am really happy about that
4687867 despite all the talk about sexism in the presidential campaign the majority of women voters laid the blame for hillarys loss squarely on her and her strategists shoulders they largely reject gender as a cause of her demise
4687868 the technology has changed and the political and environmental landscape has changed if youre concerned about climate change wheres the power coming from thats why youre not hearing the same opposition you heard 20 years ago
4687869 i did not know she my husbands ex wife was so difficult or i might have had second thoughts about marrying him
4687870 this woman has tested my every being the past five years i can find something good in everyone but not her dealing with her is like playing a chess game
4687871 we are in the midst of financial ruin even contemplating bankruptcy
4687872 she on the other hand plays the sympathy card and always manages to get a lawyer to work for her pro bono we would never qualify for that we make too much money but no one takes into consideration legal bills
4687873 the kids attorney at mediation told her that her recommendation would be for the kids to come live with us we spent five hours in mediation after getting up at 2 a m in order to be there at 8 a m
4687874 she his ex wife has caused hard times in my usually happy marriage i believe he is my soul mate and love him to death but i constantly wonder how such a wonderful man could marry such a woman
4687875 my kids have seen me cry they have cried we have had financial problems because of her which has caused resentment between my kids my husband and his kids
4687876 the secrets of happily married men eight ways to win your wifes heart forever
4687877 it is impossible to entirely break off ties with an ex spouse when there are children involved
4687878 the ex wifes involvement will likely be the source of some marital tension in the new marriage
4687879 they both kids both signed the preference forms last summer stating they wanted to live here but the girl changed her mind as soon as she went home and mommy found out the boy did not he is miserable up there and wants to live here
4687880 in a second marriage people are more likely to say they care more about the children than their spouse
4687881 even in a second marriage the priority has to be the marriage
4687882 different core values that is why they are arguing it creates conflict and usually if someone has different values than you you walk away and stay away
4687883 certainly sex is a big one how much you want to have or dont want to have how important it is to you that can be a marriage breaker you may argue and argue over it and its probably going to predict that you dont stay together
4687884 whereas orderliness probably is very minor in the larger spectrum
4687885 so for instance if he values having a lot of sex and consequently devalues honesty then he believes there is nothing wrong with cheating as long as you dont get caught
4687886 he doesnt value honor but does value expedience and opportunism and if conversely she doesnt value sex and values honor there is going to be a big problem he doesnt want to be loyal he is having affairs she wants him to be loyal they are going to argue
4687887 you will do one of two things you expect the other person to change but that cant happen because every person believes their values lead to their greatest happiness and you cant change your values at first you are optimistic the other person will change but then you realize that you cant change them so what happens is you quarrel over and over again
4687888 the problem is why would you want to change you value it it is part of who you are your values make you happy they define you sure you can be tolerant and try to change your behavior but even if you do temporary compliance the value doesnt change at all it only creates some distancing and disrespect and it cant be resolved you can only agree to tolerate it
4687889 you need to understand that the reason for your conflict its because you are different there is no ulterior motive you were just born different
4687890 different values mean you are going in different directions how can you respect someone who has different value for instance if you value intellectual activity and your spouse devalues it how can you have conversations values are very central get along with someone for a long period of time
4687891 i dont know if there is a magic number its up to people to decide what is important to them or not but i think when you get to five or six values that you feel strongly about and you dont agree when you start to go over that it depends on how strong those conflicts are those can create disrespect and problems
4687892 but the opposite is true too where you have shared values you have bonding and a sense of understanding each other you have an enjoyment of similar activities aiming for a similar goal
4687893 so what weve only been dating for two months how about we get married
4687894 healthy narcissism is a mature balanced love of oneself coupled with a stable sense of self worth and self esteem
4687895 the sick narcissists sense of self worth and self esteem derive entirely from audience feedback because the narcissist has no self esteem or self worth of his own in the absence of observers the narcissist shrivels to non existence and feels dead
4687896 while there are likely genetic factors that make someone predisposed to narcissism the way they are raised can make a huge difference in how that narcissism develops
4687897 it is those who are unable to remain morally pure who are looked upon with contempt
4687898 i also have no doubt that a lot of republicans and independents are going to be attracted to his call for a new era of non ideological bipartisan decision making
4687899 we believe fossil fuels are going to predominate for at least 50 years
4687900 these suckers are so soaked in oil that i can walk in water and they dont leak
4687901 every time you use it you have to wait another billion years for something to create some methane
4687902 say we had a mine that had a 30 inch seam of coal that we were following and mining
4687903 that seam was getting thinner and thinner and thinner at some point you quit mining that coal but if the price is up maybe youd mine the 24 inch seam longer than you would
4687904 and it must happen because even natural gas will not be sustainable forever we do need to switch to renewable resources the gas buys time i dont believe that the market forces in this day and age will favor just an overnight conversion
4687905 north pole may be ice free for first time this summer
4687906 when the former vice president left office al gore was worth an estimated 2 million
4687907 the gospel of john chapter 17 so we have learned the secret of seeing jesus as ourselves a mirror of the father and therefore are alligned in such a way now that we can communicate
4687908 i am a lamp to thee who seest me i am a mirror to thee who understands me i am a door to thee who knockest at me i am a way for thee a wayfarer
4687909 turbotax 2007 is the result of a singular focus on ease weve created a dramatically simplified tax preparation experience to delight customers
4687910 by making turbotax the easiest tax software to use we help customers get the best possible outcome on their taxes
4687911 people spend a lot of time at work and it is easy to confuse common interests with work interests
4687912 its very easy to make that mistake what happens is you share common talk and pretty soon your comfort zone increases and then you start talking about other things like shared values and viewpoints and common interests so it slowly evolves into something more than just being coworkers
4687913 the office is an affair incubator just like college if you are single and dating the best time in the world to date is in college because you are together with a bunch of other people who all have same things in common you have a common focus and lots of opportunity to get to know each other before you date it is a relationship incubator just like the office
4687914 its the same kind of situation you are together working on something it has nothing to do with a personal relationship at all its a pseudo intimacy but you have this constant contact and you start to appreciate that person
4687915 attention is not just the number one reason its the only reason people have affairs our lives are all about our need for attention
4687916 the hours spent in the office are very long and you dont have the stresses you have in your family people stay at the office because they dont want to go home first they become friends then they go out for a drink and then they dont want to go home because of what is at home the relationship becomes an escape
4687917 the novelty of it is huge at the workplace someone pays attention to you and thinks you are wonderful
4687918 couples tend to minimize the differences theyre sure to encounter throughout their lifetime
4687919 they may be getting along now but when they have a child things get complicated
4687920 once children start walking and talking your parents will start to influence you so you need to pick one or two things that would make them happy
4687921 if their different faiths have particular demands in terms of raising kids then it can be a challenge
4687922 it depends on how involved with the culture couples are if theyre fundamentalist orthodox conservative or strictly ethnocentric then theyll need to reach some common ground in terms of the higher principles that these religions support like unconditional love justice and tolerance this lets them put their differences in the context of a larger whole
4687923 american culture is strongly focused on self and personal independence
4687924 other cultures like asian for example are more focused on the group more concerned about saving face
4687925 we americans tend to deal with conflicts more directly explicitly shooting from the hip we express ourselves through low contact and very direct and precise communications middle eastern societies for example use more words and body language theyre more implicit than explicit
4687926 in many cultures the extended family is highly valued so take the time to listen and talk about what others needs are then try to address as many of these needs as you can
4687927 the question was whether divorce itself is a trigger for receiving a prescription for ritalin
4687928 the results of my study showed that it was not just living in a single parent household that created risk for ritalin use but more specifically that experiencing divorce was associated with a nearly two fold increase in the odds of taking ritalin
4687929 prevalence of methylphenidate use among canadian children following parental divorce
4687930 it would be premature to say that divorce itself causes ritalin use although it is certainly one plausible explanation
4687931 that is the stress of divorce may overwhelm coping resources of the child and lead to a diagnosis of adhd
4687932 parents who transmit the disorder to their child themselves directly through genes or indirectly through socialization may also be at greater risk for experiencing divorce themselves
4687933 their personalities may make it difficult for them to remain married
4687934 children are more likely to come into contact with the health care system following divorce and this contact coupled with the assumption that divorce is necessarily harmful may increase the likelihood that a physician will prescribe ritalin
4687935 adhd has a natural developmental history that goes back to the preschool years
4687936 children start having problems when theyre 3 to 5 years of age one does not usually develop adhd when they are 8 9 or 10 when that happens its usually not adhd as we consider it
4687937 hello my name is inigo montoya you killed my father prepare to die
4687938 is very strange i have been in the revenge business so long now that its over i dont know what to do with the rest of my life
4687939 forgiveness is the only means given our humanness and imperfections to overcome hate and condemnation and proceed with the business of loving and growing
4687940 the freely chosen foregoing of resentment or revenge when the wrongdoers actions deserve it and the beyond duty act of overcoming evil with good by giving the gifts of mercy generosity and love when the wrongdoer does not deserve them
4687941 everyone is flawed not just the person youre hanging out with appreciate what you have and spend much more time thinking about whats right with your partner rather than whats wrong because usually that tells a lot more of the truth in most relationships people are doing a lot of good things and most of that is taken for granted
4687942 forgiveness doesnt necessarily mean reconciliation with the person who has hurt you
4687943 reconciliation is about two parties coming together in mutual respect
4687944 sometimes it takes years to get out of it depending on how many accounts have been breached
4687945 the women in the class will respect you stretching yourself they will feel you share core values
4687946 turn on your inner light fitness for body mind and soul
4687947 before you go out there and hunt quarry you have to be at peace with you
4687948 i think its a great idea men can reap all the benefits as women can from yoga the basic benefits of feeling better and spirit and wellness
4687949 i know men arent crazy about that but were not talking about hopping the fence here
4687950 yoga is a practice that makes us more aware of ourselves in general and that is a great balance and benefit for a man who has to deal with his emotions after a divorce
4687951 bringing up a kid on your own is extraordinarily difficult bringing up two isnt twice as hard its 200 times as hard
4687952 its extremely hard extremely hard and stressing and at the same time so amazingly wonderful
4687953 i work for myself and have for years so i can make my own hours
4687954 the toughest time i have had was with my little one who was two and a half years old when my wife and i broke up that was really brutal she was traumatized screaming i miss mommy for five hours at a time she was frothing at the mouth with such pain i was overwhelmed i cried i didnt know what to do so i took her to a psychiatrist
4687955 it was really heartbreaking here she was still in diapers and i was pushing her in a stroller to see her psychiatrist it was overwhelming i look back on that and wonder how did i do it i have no idea
4687956 while you wonder in the beginning how you are going to make it i have found that if people go full circle in their divorce recovery they will come out stronger on the emotional side it is a time for great personal growth
4687957 if you dont care for yourself you cant sufficiently care for your children
4687958 when you are married you compromise things out of your life even in a good marriage but as the marriage disintegrates you do less and less for yourself you find yourself getting a little depressed and trying to make the marriage work so you put yourself at about ninth on the list
4687959 the shock of divorce and death are really overwhelming before i was divorced i was used to hearing that but i was not prepared for the pain i was going to go through when i got divorced it takes a long time to build up again
4687960 theres a lot of denial around divorce whether you admit it or not there still a lot of shame and guilt about divorce that is where a recovery group can be so helpful
4687961 you have to de isolate yourself what better way than be with people who have gone though the same thing
4687962 the way partners share a bed says a huge amount how much they really like each other trust and feel safe with each other
4687963 analyzing sleep positions can highlight trouble spots they may not even be aware of
4687964 they are showing a need for closeness as well as a desire to maintain individuality
4687965 like two circles separate but overlapping this position is a perfect definition of interdependence
4687966 the partner who distances may actually want to be pursued
4687967 theyre avoiding a lot of issues and dont trust each other
4687968 when i met my husband i took everything he said at face value i did not know what a troubled soul he was four years into our marriage he told me that he had been depressed and suicidal all of his adult life his brother was bipolar as was his father
4687969 what every woman should know about divorce and custody how to keep the kids the cash and your sanity
4687970 dealing with a bi polar spouse makes the difficult divorce process infinitely more harrowing
4687971 bi polar disorder also known as manic depressive illness is a serious medical illness that causes shifts in a persons mood energy and ability to function different from the normal ups and downs that everyone goes through the symptoms of bi polar disorder are severe bi polar disorder causes dramatic mood swings from overly high and or irritable to sad and hopeless and then back again often with periods of normal mood in between severe changes in energy and behavior go along with these changes in mood the periods of highs and lows are called episodes of mania and depression
4687972 his father and five of his fathers siblings deaths were all directly related to alcohol abuse
4687973 commonly a person learns that his or her spouse is bi polar over the course of several years of marriage and there may or may not be a diagnosis
4687974 what we more commonly associate with bi polar disorder such as the extreme mood swings and dramatic shifts between manic and depressive behavior is sometimes not present until a major life crisis triggers a full blown episode of mania thus its very common for milder cases of the illness to delay an accurate diagnosis
4687975 he cashed in over 300 000 in retirement iras and six months later had a little over 100 000 left the only thing he had to show for his money was a 1955 triumph sports car that had not run in over 10 years he was drunk every day probation rules said he was to avoid alcohol despite instructions from his probation officer he left dallas county daily he took medicine for his bi polar condition only when he felt stressed not on a regular basis
4687976 when married to someone with bi polar the risk for divorce is higher because of the significant impairment that the spouse with bi polar may exhibit i have had numerous bi polar clients that during their marriage compulsively spend or gamble away money use drugs have affairs during a manic period but also have times when they cannot get out of bed during a depressed cycle
4687977 during a divorce dealing with a bi polar spouse can be likened to the difference between jekyll and hyde with extreme shifts in mood and behavior the emotional strain and stress associated with divorce has been associated with triggering the onset of a severe manic episode or relapse of some sort
4687978 be very consistent in what message is given throughout the divorce process the bi polar spouse needs to understand that no matter what they do or say their former partner is unswayed in their decision any yo yoing in intention will make it very hard for the bipolar spouse to accept their changed future
4687979 many times a spouse will try to help the other spouse if a bi polar spouse is not cooperative that can be difficult
4687980 a mental health professional is a must you may need to go into court to get a restraining order to protect yourself physically you may also need to freeze accounts if there is a possibility that your spouse may dissipate assets if you at any time fear for your safety have an escape plan
4687981 clients also have to be very aware of the amount of time the bi polar parent has with the children as they can be often make irresponsible decisions putting the children in emotional or physical danger
4687982 there may be accusations regarding who is fit when there are children involved
4687983 a mental health professional may be asked to perform a court ordered evaluation a mental health evaluation often involves a personal interview and possibly submission of psychological tests or questionnaires a summary evaluation is submitted to the court
4687984 it is better to take money upfront than to get it over the years you know that you have got your share of equitable distribution that way
4687985 if possible try to be supportive of your bipolar spouse by managing your anxiety and keeping potentially distressful situations to a minimum
4687986 have the vast majority and sometimes all communication be through the attorneys
4687987 while you may not be able to control the behavior of your former spouse the good news is that you can control your own responses and decisions
4687988 we dont know who the aviation week sources were but boeing has not been talking about our internal deliberations no decisions have been made all options remain on the table
4687989 this could be beautiful you know just try to enjoy it it wont be long before you can leave again
4687990 then there is an expectation of privacy and youd better not be blowing by it
4687991 we dont disclose the length of time except to law enforcement but its not lengthy and can vary but you can think of it as days not weeks or months
4687992 they will not do anything if you have not filed an action
4687993 the tools that you use to extract the data have to be pretty robust
4687994 it depends as living in certainly allows for an easy getaway if things get rough it is certainly easier to walk away from cohabitation than marriage as there are none of those legal tangles of alimony and child support broken commitments or stigmas
4687995 the trauma of losing someone you tend to trust and start depending on cannot be explained i lost everything emotional after my divorce at least i had spousal support but here i not only lost emotionally but financially too i lost everything financially as i had pooled in my money with my partner but today the relationship is over and i have nothing to prove that it was my money
4687996 but there is a huge difference between palimony laws and divorce laws

4688002 there is no way other countries should look down on us in the administration of our own laws our criminal procedure code and the penal code emanate from the common law
4688003 therefore there is no reason whatsoever for any other power in the world to criticise us in administering justice and the rule of law

4688011 but a family member came forward and told the court that the wife was actually the one who had taken the gold

4688020 if they have nothing to divide then its the easiest and most inexpensive way to get a divorce
4688021 in using a paralegal they either have to be in agreement or they cant find the other person so they know they will serve by publication and the other person wont respond because the paralegal cannot give legal advice
4688022 a paralegal can do everything an attorney can do except give legal advice or step inside a court
4688023 somebody who prepares documents cant give advice but they have the knowledge
4688024 its just complicated for people it can be a real challenge
4688025 nope remember i told you the horse isnt there yet were going to have to create this look

4688030 this is a district that has been changing a lot over the last several years the number of new people in the district is huge and the people who have lived in the district are also changing
4688031 she doesnt have much of a political track record and she has staked out very left positions in a moderate district
4688032 my hunch is that if there is a democratic wave nationally reichert will be one of the incumbents who is swept away by it
4688033 but the race is a toss up if the national pattern is more competitive
4688034 my sense is that 2006 might have been a peak for democrats in washington
4688035 at least our polls showed the war was a bigger issue then versus now and that had to help burner in 2006
4688036 if theres an obama mobilization effect this year or an anti incumbent vote due to the economy there might be a trend toward democrats in the 8th the big question is will that trend be as large as the anti war spike in 2006
4688037 while the district has a republican partisan leaning it has been a swing district for some time
4688038 the split ticket voting indicates that party preferences are soft at the margins and the district could go either way
4688039 long before the democratic party was returning my phone calls
4688040 we didnt want to change what was working what was working was our message and what was working was the grassroots approach
4688041 kirks been more active in the district emphasizing case work a bit more and raising money more than he did in 2006 when seals seemed to have surprised him
4688042 kirk is taking nothing for granted so this is going to be a tough close race
4688043 the interest in change is bigger than it was in 2006
4688044 what we are seeing is record turnout at our events and if you look at the election turnout for the primary
4688045 i smell trouble like a freight train off the william shatner advocates
4688046 al gore said the other day we can do this in 10 years and a lot of people were skeptical about that but we can do it in less than 10 years
4688047 john mccain is a homosexual darkie loving nazi i stole much of this from the bush campaign from 2000
4688048 we have every intention of moving forward with our delegation and are prepared to be seated at the national convention
4688049 were trying to keep the process within the party and let the party decide
4688050 long before anyone was aware that it was essentially a hoax
4688051 false stories lead to false solutions this is the history of nclb
4688052 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4688053 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4688054 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4688055 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4688056 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4688057 in 1985 there were 14 500 banks in the u s and now theres 7 200
4688058 for the past 23 years six of them went away each week the big universal banks might get hit but they stay in business and come out with a bigger share of the market than they had before
4688059 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4688060 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4688061 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4688062 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4688063 the americans have never lost that race since its been an event in the olympic games
4688064 you have to be very cautious on the relay exchanges and make sure nobody gets disqualified but it should be just a matter of what the time is going to be and whos going to put the gold medal around their neck first
4688065 philadelphians your rights are being invaded regardless of your interests or the lives of your little ones the camden and amboy with the assistance of other companies without a charter and in violation of law as decreed by your courts are laying a locomotive railroad rally people in the majesty of your strength and forbid this outrage
4688066 and they did what they were supposed to with them
4688067 the first three hitters of the game he obviously wasnt on track
4688068 i was trying to overthrow early but after that i settled in and worked down in the zone
4688069 he threw the ball well he located his fastball extremely well
4688070 you have to tip your hat sometimes to the other team he pitched a heck of a game
4688071 we havent been getting many opportunities with less than two outs it seems like all our opportunities now are coming with two outs and it has been tough to get that hit we had opportunities we were just one hit away
4688072 as a pastor i believe in the separation of church and state but i dont believe we can separate religion from politics because ones faith determines ones worldview which informs ones decisions and determines how one would lead
4688073 the reason we are hosting this historic event is to stake out common ground for the common good
4688074 the saddleback civil forum on the presidency will be conducted in a non debate format to provide opportunity for the candidates to engage in a long form conversation about critical issues of interest to the faith community and the general public
4688075 at the candidates request the questions will only be posed by warren not a panel or from the audience and open to all media rather than co sponsored by one network or news outlet as with many of the earlier primary events as a result more than 550 media representatives have requested credentials to cover the event as news
4688076 warren will question each candidate beginning with sen obama as determined by a coin toss for approximately one hour on four different topics stewardship leadership worldview and americas role in the world
4688077 unlike earlier debates which often focused on short term hot button issues such as the war price of oil and healthcare warren will be posing identical questions to the candidates to help show american voters each of these senators leadership style and decision making process
4688078 since announcing this event last month i have seen concerns expressed from two groups about this civil forum and my role in it
4688079 i will ask all the tough questions but this is a conversation not a confrontation and i am going to be civil in our discussion people know where i stand on the critical issues however this forum is not about me and what i believe but to give a place for america to hear the candidates hearts by going beyond moral issues and their virtues to also share their values and vision for leadership
4688080 out of the ruins of the 1994 rwandan genocide have come the most astounding and moving stories of faith hope forgiveness reconciliation and miracles that ive ever heard if youve had a hard time letting go of a deep hurt or difficulty in releasing your offender so you can get on with the rest of your life immacul es story can lead you to the place of healing restoration and peace
4688081 in led by faith immacul e takes us with her as her remarkable journey continues
4688082 through her simple and eloquent voice we experience her hardships and heartache as she struggles to survive and to find meaning and purpose in the aftermath of the holocaust
4688083 immacul e fends off sinister new predators seeks out and comforts scores of children orphaned by the genocide and searches for love and companionship in a land where hatred still flourishes then fearing again for her safety as rwandas war crime trials begin immacul e flees to america to begin a new chapter of her life as a refugee and immigrant a stranger in a strange land
4688084 with the same courage and faith in god that led her through the darkness of genocide immacul e discovers a new life that was beyond her wildest dreams as a small girl in a tiny village in one of africas poorest countries it is in the united states her adopted country where immacul e can finally look back at all that has happened to her and truly understand why god spared her life so that she would be left to tell her story to the world
4688085 mike is a proven nhl player who has had two seasons that have been not at the level he was previously
4688086 we expect him to seriously compete for a job here if he can get back to a level he was on the island 2005 06 hell be a very good addition for us
4688087 i do not want as i believe most americans do not want to sell out american interests to simply withdraw to raise the white flag of surrender
4688088 the reversals of the last several months have led our military to ask for more troops
4688089 the war far from being the last critical test for the united states is in fact weakening our position in asia and around the world and eroding the structure of international cooperation which has directly supported our security for the past three decades
4688090 but the costs of the wars present course far outweigh anything we can reasonably hope to gain by it for ourselves or for the people of vietnam
4688091 you are the people as president kennedy said who have
4688092 if there is one thing for which we stand in this country it is for complete religious freedom and it is an emphatic negation of this right to cross examine a man on his religion before being willing to support him for office

4688100 well take the niggers and the chinks but not the irish
4688101 given the cultural zeitgeist who exactly will choose to be white if they can have the choice of being something more vibrant
4688102 im probably oversimplifying things but i think for someone to pass as white in society they need to
4688103 sd i think that rather than a low trust society we are working towards becoming a high trust society
4688104 given the cultural zeitgeist who exactly will choose to be white if they can have the choice of being something more vibrant you could say that in 1910 if you were jewish that you would want to be considered white but in 2010 how many people who wouldnt be automatically considered white will really want to be considered white posted by hrm august 14 2008 2 36 pm

4688145 we are hopeful we can continue cooperation with the russians
4688146 but a lot of this depends on russia and what russias actions are in the near future
4688147 were optimistic things will work out in the long run
4688148 their failure to do so has put us in this regrettable situation

4688154 the metre and rhyme work as a means of crystallising a certain thought or feeling rap is the opposite

4688161 thats what wins ballgames you can go back to the dodgers in the 60s thats what wins its not offense when we pitch good when they give us a chance weve got enough offense to find a way to score some runs

4688163 the reality is crazy things happen all the time lincecum is out there shoving it up our rear next thing you know brad ausmus hits a line drive off his knee cap and were in their bullpen and we score eight runs in the seventh inning anything can happen

4688176 dont ask her that question shes so certain stardom is around the corner she organizes her own entourage sort of
4688177 she telephoned collect to ask me to pick her up at the airport there i was wrestling my demonically possessed kids into snow suits and tearing out to the airport only to discover that shed called a half dozen other people to meet her flight youd think she was returning from a kidnapping ordeal in afghanistan in stead of a couple of months in toronto the only thing lacking was banners not that she wasnt looking around for them of course maybe she needed that many cars to carry her luggage
4688178 what do you think will bring her down to planet earth
4688179 i know one thing that would bring her down to earth find ing a husband having two screaming kids developing cellulite

4688190 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
4688191 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
4688192 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
4688193 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
4688194 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
4688195 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
4688196 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
4688197 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
4688198 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
4688199 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
4688200 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
4688201 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
4688202 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
4688203 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
4688204 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
4688205 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
4688206 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
4688207 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
4688208 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
4688209 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
4688210 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
4688211 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4688212 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
4688213 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
4688214 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
4688215 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
4688216 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
4688217 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
4688218 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
4688219 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

4688228 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come
4688229 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
4688230 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
4688231 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
4688232 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
4688233 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
4688234 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
4688235 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
4688236 who are open to doing something on the production side
4688237 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
4688238 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
4688239 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
4688240 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
4688241 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
4688242 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
4688243 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
4688244 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for members of congress to act now and act boldly to expand and encourage the development of all our resources
4688245 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action
4688246 this legislation will strengthen our energy futures markets by ensuring integrity there are a wide degree of opinions on whether or not and how much speculation in the energy market is influencing the price of oil this legislation will help us get the data we need to make informed rationale decisions in this area it also puts more cops on the beat policing these markets by providing the commodity futures trading commission with the resources it needs to hire more employees
4688247 im happy to see them come down id like to see them go lower
4688248 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
4688249 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
4688250 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
4688251 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
4688252 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
4688253 the political future of president musharraf is a matter to be decided by the pakistani people through normal constitutional channels washington should not do anything that appearing as thwarting their will
4688254 i am heartened by the reconciliation of the leading political parties in pakistan and their decision to break the deadlock which has virtually immobilized the pakistani government in recent months
4688255 indias commitments under the current terms of the proposed arrangement do not justify making far reaching exceptions to international non proliferation rules and norms
4688256 the 45 member nations of nsg is scheduled to meet next week in vienna to discuss the us proposal to relax nsg restrictions on trade with states such as india that refuse to allow comprehensive international nuclear safeguards
4688257 unlike 178 other countries india has not signed the comprehensive test ban treaty ctbt it continues to produce fissile material and expand its nuclear arsenal
4688258 me quedo por que no quiero que haya m s fernandos
4688259 quiz haya llegado el momento en que se pueda cometer cualquier tipo de maldad y crueldad para que la gente se harte y le d la espalda aterrorizada y asqueada

4688261 calder n hay seguridad para ti y la seguridad para el pueblo en d nde est
4688262 is it me or did they just cut and paste last years results and call em power rankinz
4688263 wow those rankings suck as others have already mentioned they pretty much took last years results and made them this years power rankings
4688264 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
4688265 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
4688266 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
4688267 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
4688268 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
4688269 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
4688270 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
4688271 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
4688272 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
4688273 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
4688274 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
4688275 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
4688276 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
4688277 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
4688278 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
4688279 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
4688280 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline
4688281 every time someone uses food stamps a farmer or rancher somewhere benefits
4688282 there are some hard and tough decisions to make there he has heard predictions that by 2015 social security will pay out more in benefits than it is taking in and that new recipients born after a specified time are being advised that their benefit will be 78 percent of expectations
4688283 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
4688284 tomen la verdad como cintur n la justicia como coraza
4688285 tengan siempre en la mano el escudo de la fe y podr n atajar las flechas incendiarias del demonio
4688286 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
4688287 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
4688288 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
4688289 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again
4688290 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
4688291 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
4688292 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
4688293 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
4688294 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
4688295 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
4688296 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
4688297 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
4688298 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
4688299 these two cases in texas are just the tip of the iceberg
4688300 across texas and around the country people are convicted of arson based on junk science that has been completely discredited for years
4688301 is that it was pretty much the wild west back then that the state of the science was dismal
4688302 each and every one of the indicators listed by mr vasquez means absolutely nothing and in fact is expected in a context of a fire that has achieved full room involvement as this fire clearly did
4688303 low burning charred flooring burning underneath items of furniture are common characteristics of a fully involved fire
4688304 they mean nothing with respect to the origin and cause of the fire
4688305 i talked to the occupant of this house and i let him talk and he told me a story of pure fabrication
4688306 tells the story i am just the interpreter i am looking at the fire and i am interpreting the fire that is what i know that is what i do best and the fire does not lie it tells me the truth
4688307 to this day enthusiasm for pay for performance runs far ahead of any data supporting its effectiveness even as measured by standardized test scores much less by meaningful indicators of learning but then that too echoes the results in other workplaces to the best of my knowledge

4688311 i think its a fundamental tenet of our party to be pro life but that does not mean we exclude people from our party that are pro choice
4688312 girls who have sex might be whores but two dudes touching on each other is fucking disgusting yet so oddly compelling
4688313 have you ever checked out which are the fastest growing churches today
4688314 the biblical and patristic witness certainly needs to be taken very seriously not simply airily dismissed
4688315 know the enemy know yourself a hundred battles no defeat
4688316 en estados unidos se van a realizar una serie de actividades por los cinco dijo respondiendo al llamado a acciones internacionales a partir del 12 de septiembre y hasta el 8 de octubre
4688317 las actividades ser n variadas y estamos seguros que no todas se han hecho publica pero las dos m s importantes que se conocen ser n el mismo d a 13 de septiembre
4688318 la idea del concierto es justamente llegar a una audiencia nueva que nunca han escuchado del caso
4688319 definitivamente ahora hay m s conocimiento del caso despu s de 10 a os muchas son las razones por las cuales la gente se ha ido enterando pero a n la gran mayor a de los americanos desconoce quienes son los cinco
4688320 tenemos muchas cosas en contra para lograrlo como esas de que los grandes medios de difusi n no cubren el caso vivimos en un pa s donde sus administraciones de turno han sido y contin an siendo hostiles a cuba
4688321 sin embargo somos optimistas y de a poco vamos rompiendo ese muro de silencio
4688322 hemos tambi n llegado a muchas personas que se sensibilizan cuando escuchan que dos mujeres adriana y olga no pueden visitar a sus esposos porque el gobierno de ee
4688323 pensamos que la solidaridad en este caso tiene que ser constante de todos los d as y eso es lo que estamos tratando de hacer
4688324 political correctness isnt always great but the positive side of it is that it becomes socially unacceptable to do that type of
4688325 i truly despise when people wrap themselves in the cloak of free speech as a defense attack against pc norms theres much more to be gained for the future of our children if we just stop tolerating the soft racism as much as the hardcore stuff
4688326 in 65 i so totally would have been a freedom rider but i missed my chance too bad but now i can every scour every interaction for bigotry thats just as valuable a contribution as crossing the pettis bridge
4688327 so when is that 80 percent going to be held accountable why are teachers shouldering 100 percent of the responsibility for our nations children when their sphere of influence accounts for less than 20 percent of the childs waking life
4688328 if a student is already struggling to find a way to care about school emphasis on test preparation and test performance will do nothing to help students who find no interest in traditional academic subjects and who find self esteem and purpose in
4688329 why dont they just speak up for themselves and refuse to go along with it
4688330 i want it give it to me ill make you a good trade i will make you a present
4688331 what on earth would you want with this sweater mahmoud youre at the edge of the sahara

4688335 im not going out into the desert with these guys
4688336 what kind of dives has this guy been staying in
4688337 sounds like this writer went native long ago and now holds court at the local whore house
4688338 travel writing works in a cyclical manner we write about a place people go there and then we must continue to write about the place because it has become a tourist destination unfortunately with success and development comes a change and the tourist friendly places just get busier pricier and more touristy they often become places where i would not want to spend my vacation time but we have to acknowledge their popularity nevertheless sometimes up and coming spots are added because they are listed in a competitors guidebook because a writer such as myself finds them unique and squeezes them in or because they have become hotspots as the result of overflow from the other destinations in the book most cities and towns clubs and restaurants beyond those are passed over or given a short mention in the guidebook as such although guidebooks give the illusion of open ended adventure and possibility and claim that they seek to serve the independent traveler they are often little more than a paper arrow pointing down an overhyped tourist route or gringo trail so to speak
4688339 how do you expect me to cover and write about the entire region for six grand
4688340 hurricane katrina and rita proved that offshore drilling techniques are safe
4688341 one of the great unwritten success stories after katrina and rita these awful storms no major spills
4688342 its safe enough these days that not even hurricanes katrina and rita could cause significant spillage from the battered rigs off the coasts of new orleans and houston
4688343 in selling his absurd coastline drilling plan to the american people
4688344 mccain has time and again pointed to advanced technology that would supposedly eliminate the threat of massive oil spills having to cancel your big oil drilling photo op in louisiana last week because of a massive oil spill is like canceling a crime safety photo op because the house next door just got robbed look up irony in the dictionary and you will find a description of this turn of events
4688345 x was a slap in the face poke in the eye noogie in the noggin to hillary clinton
4688346 hillary agreed to the rules in fact hillarys people set the rules what are you complaining about
4688347 what is the one issue on which hilary clinton is so right and barak obama so wrong that a mccain presidency would be preferable
4688348 were the tables turned i sincerely doubt any obama supporter would have that difficult a time pulling the lever for hilary
4688349 for instance in washington state about 1 of the population participated in the dem caucus this year but the participation was substantially higher in the non binding primary
4688350 if these people are so willing to vote against their self interest then they deserve a mccain presidency filled with lobbyist induced wars
4688351 the party says a record 250 000 people turned out for the caucuses which senator barack obama won by 36 percentage points
4688352 well no nearly 10 of the population participated in the dem caucus in washington 518k people or so only a few more participated in the mail in primary about 557 000 in any case much more than 1 turnout for the caucus
4688353 everyone understood that the primaries were non binding for the presidential nomination process
4688354 what is the one issue on which hilary clinton is so right and barak obama so wrong that a mccain presidency would be preferable
4688355 chris why dont you answer dearleader nycs main question the only really important one on this entire issue
4688356 when did i ever say i wasnt voting for obama
4688357 is if you take a white dump you take a white dump or you drain the main vein and it looks like coca cola you get on a pair of sunglasses and get to the airport fast before you turn yellow and they bar you from getting on the plane otherwise youre stuck in some hell hole for months
4688358 it may be that this is the end of the matter
4688359 we may want to inquire further as to whether judo officials did know about it but it certainly appears that they did not and we would always prima facie take the word of our member federations
4688360 whilst we obviously would have preferred that matt would have disclosed the position he competed for australia in the olympic games in his category and no doubt performed absolutely to his best on behalf of australia
4688361 i know the americans in their agreement require a disclosure of all charges or convictions and that may be a way that we go
4688362 hes an olympian hes part of the team and he was absolutely not tapped on the shoulder as if this was what he had to do not at all
4688363 so what im still a rock star i got my rock moves and i dont need you and guess what im havin more fun and now that were done and youre a tool so what
4688364 and when i rest my head on its on a pee low uh beebeebee beebeebee beebeebee yo
4688365 in this world i clutch two auto matos used to call fatso now you call me castro
4688366 im gonna take you to the candy shop im gonna make you lick my lollipop
4688367 for naught gives increase and naught takes away on which account just as they move to day
4688368 i dumbed down for my audience to double my dollars
4688369 and if i was in front of shakespeare id battle the punk and take his shit
4688370 weakness is that it pushes too hard to be contemporary and it draws on a code and an idiom which is a esoteric and b rapidly turns obsolete
4688371 how do i love thee let me count the ways
4688372 a newspaper burns in the sand and the headline reads man kills man
4688373 who would do better a emcee writing a sonnet or a poet laureate writing a rap verse my vote goes to the emcee but im biased
4688374 i wanted to add that though the lyrics might be considered poetry a more apt comparison between art forms would be rap and opera
4688375 how do you defend lyrics like these against those who label hip hop a bad influence im sticking ice picks on the tip of ya dick give your testicles a swift kick aint that some shit im a hard hard core harder than a plymouth it aint no lip its a nigga with a spliff and a chrome four fifth pressed on your back so what you want nigga how you gonna act
4688376 melanthius they hauled him out through the doorway into the court lopped his nose and ears with a ruthless knife tore his genitals out for the dogs to eat raw and in manic fury hacked off his hands and feet
4688377 it was at that very moment that i realized i was supposed to take the shells off my god they were crunchy
4688378 bon une autre session qui commence est ce que je vais passer au travers cest quoi mes cours mon horaire
4688379 its crazy this man rangel controls tax policy in the united states hes a lot bigger than just a regular member of congress he deserves more respect than this
4688380 the worst part of this whole affair is the sentiment among some clinton supporters that they didnt actually lose the primary they agreed to give to obama and thus should be treated like co winners
4688381 and there are other clinton supporters who say that obama is the dnc candidate not the democratic party candidate so they will vote for mccain in november
4688382 omg im so tired of the clintonites i have had enough enough already how many rings does obama have to kiss to be able to claim what he earned fair and square
4688383 now i need to talk with my supporters about what comes next there are so many options and no time to think over them in the last 7 months
4688384 you concede graciously and rally behind obama really by tomorrow or the rest of us do it on your behalf
4688385 the iowa chops offered brett favre a contract all i can say is w t f
4688386 e ele me respondeu dizendo que ela ele e meu pai estavam no hospital pois minha mam e querida tinha passado mal de manh
4688387 sleight of hand and twist of fate on a bed of nails she makes me wait and i wait without you
4688388 acordei com a minha m e me cobrindo e dando um beijo no rosto que nem filme sabe
4688389 a closer look at the central division cbj part 2
4688390 and i just let out this great sigh of relief and i thought god there is so much space here in new york and the people are so polite and the air is so fresh and thats when i knew i gotta get out of hong kong
4688391 i have been presented to her royal highness the queen no less than eight times
4688392 is it about money trudy is it about money well give you more money if thats what its about
4688393 yes sir you can take this seat im taking this couple up to first class
4688394 no sir this is your seat it says so right on your ticket you keep this seat
4688395 were very happy to have signed pascal to a new contract that will keep him with the blue jackets for the next three seasons
4688396 he is an important part of our team and we think he will continue to improve and play a significant role in helping us reach our goals
4688397 i definitely think i could have won that match no doubt
4688398 i should have given more attacked more i got caught up in her tie ups and her pushing on me i should have i dont know fought harder i guess
4688399 i was trying to run as slow as i could and advance
4688400 it is very unfortunate what happened to them and i have heard the allegations about me but i dont know whats going on
4688401 i have been training secluded and have barely seen my team mates
4688402 i did ok today not really so good or so bad
4688403 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time
4688404 i always wondered what my feelings would be i feel a tremendous load off my back somebody told me years ago you judge ones character by the company you keep and im just happy to be in the company of michael phelps thats the bottom line
4688405 im so proud of what hes been able to do
4688406 i did what i did and it was in my day in those set of circumstances for 36 years it stood as a benchmark im just pleased that somebody was inspired by what i had done hes entitled to every second of whats occurring to him now
4688407 but after draft day i was happy i came to realize that it always works out in the end
4688408 we are very pleased to announce the signing of tim melville tim his family and adviser jason cook remained committed to this process from start to finish
4688409 tim is a very talented young man and we are excited that we were able to add a player of his caliber to the royals organization
4688410 i definitely think i could have won that match no doubt
4688411 i should have given more attacked more i got caught up in her tie ups and her pushing on me i should have i dont know fought harder i guess
4688412 she scored early and then had a lapse and then shed come back then shed find a way to get it going again
4688413 you cant have those lapses it cost us in the match against icho she let up again at the edge of the mat and got driven out of bounds you cant do that against a veteran against icho
4688414 we were rushing and it seemed like we were panicking and flowing all over the place
4688415 were better than that we need to tighten up and not be so panicky out there
4688416 playing in the olympics in whats supposed to be considered a gentlemans sport thats a time to call it on yourself
4688417 fernando looked me square in the eye and didnt call it
4688418 if that happened the other way i never would have finished the match because my father would have pulled me off the court if i had acted that way
4688419 thats a disappointing way to exit the tournament when you not only lose the match but you lose a little faith in your fellow competitor
4688420 so thats where it comes into calling it on yourself because its the right thing to do
4688421 maybe i wouldnt have expected this at the u s open but if the roles were reversed id call it on myself
4688422 whatever he wants to say is fine whatever is going to get him to have some sleep tonight then thats fine
4688423 it was after two and a half hours and i almost didnt feel my forehand if im 100 percent sure about it i mean i will give it but im not sure you know
4688424 the umpire did not see the incident clearly so it is a matter between the two players
4688425 the trick with these laws is balancing first amendment rights versus privacy rights
4688426 he took the photos without their consent he was concealed in heavy vegetation we figure he was 150 feet from them he ran from rangers
4688427 we felt that all his behavior indicated that he was trying to arouse sexual desire
4688428 theyd set them down below women in skirts and film they were putting this stuff on the web this bill was prompted by these deviants who wanted to look at womens underwear
4688429 there are questions raised because the beach is a public place and there are questions about whether a beach is an appropriate place to have a camera
4688430 you could read this law to say that such behavior is illegal and it sets itself up for a possible constitutional attack
4688431 the issue becomes whether you can have an expectation of privacy when you are swimming nude at a public place

4688436 we are an online community that connects people to new people through their friends
4688437 i am an aquarius in a relationship with a gemini when we first began it was great and i was really emotionally involved he seems like the perfect guy for me now i feel like i should be in this relationship but am emotionally detached i keep telling myself i am in a funk and it will pass i dont know if i should just ride it out and see what happens or if i should just end it and move on
4688438 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4688439 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4688440 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4688441 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4688442 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4688443 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4688444 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4688445 when i was growing up i only wanted to do one thing and that was to play for my country i have come a long way since playing my first game which was at the mcg of all places i have had the honour of captaining my country and i just cant think of a life without cricket
4688446 a lot of people ask me for how long i will continue i say i dont know it all depends on my fitness and whether i am still good enough to play for sri lanka the day i feel i havent got it any more in me i will quit
4688447 there were a few things that i worked on after the australian series early this year it was the off season and there were no domestic competitions so i had a few sessions with the bowling machine and worked ever so harder on my physical fitness
4688448 when you are going through a bad patch its very important not to panic there are so many factors that contribute to poor form and you just need to patiently work on them and the important thing is to revert to basics
4688449 i regained my touch towards the end of the ipl and was happy to be part of the asia cup squad it was a pleasant experience to win the tournament in pakistan we hadnt won any major competition in pakistan since winning the world cup
4688450 its hard to understand they are such a strong batting side for me the best in the world without any doubt but sri lanka gave india no chance they kept the pressure on and its not easy when ajantha mendis and murali bowl in tandem i thought sri lanka had a good plan which they executed to perfection there was someone to rise to the occasion at every crucial point
4688451 but i am sure they indians will bounce back sachin is a class act rahul and sourav are quality players the point is when you are having such a long career like they have had you are bound to have a poor series it happens to all players in the world but the problem here was all three of them struggled at the same time
4688452 i am really happy for what ajantha has done hes come up the hard way and his rise to stardom is something of a fairy tale hes a quiet kind of chap who wants to keep improving i have a particular liking for blokes who are the first to practice and the last to leave and mendis is something similar when you play at this level you need to keep working harder and improve your game every day
4688453 who invited the trouble here who invited this arrogance here who invited these innocent deaths here
4688454 not only those people who perpetrate them are responsible but also those people who failed to stop it
4688455 with this signature by georgia this must take place and take place now
4688456 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
4688457 only russia can decide whether it will now put itself back on the path of responsible nations or continue to pursue a policy that promises only confrontation and isolation
4688458 we want them out i want the world to know never ever will georgia reconcile with occupation of even one square kilometer of its sovereign territory never ever
4688459 the cold war is over the days of satellite states and spheres of influence are behind us
4688460 a contentious relationship with russia is not in americas interest and a contentious relationship with america is not in russias interest
4688461 to begin a discussion of the consequences of what russia has done this calls into question what role russia really plans to play in international politics
4688462 its clearly a very emotional time but i think that it should still be seen that this was a productive day i hope now that peace can return to georgia and georgians can return to a normal life
4688463 its so enticing you see or dream up this great unique idea and you want it in your home
4688464 trust me you will be sending the e mails back as a reminder

4688466 but then every time i look at my custom projects i love them
4688467 it is so quiet and peaceful theres almost never a crowd and the colors of all the different flowers are breathtaking its a chance to get away from it all in the middle of town

4688471 in america were such consumers so its nice to be able to use something again instead of tossing it in the landfill
4688472 theres some satisfaction as well achieving a goal for so much less why would you want to pay full price if you didnt have to
4688473 look for well made solid wood furniture with dovetailed drawer construction

4688477 there shall always be free public elementary and secondary schools in the state the general assembly shall implement this principle by appropriate legislation
4688478 even fishermen who spend their entire lives on boats couldnt swim
4688479 i found from the two islands that i have lived on jamaica and american samoa that swimming is not a high priority and there are a lot of drownings as a result
4688480 that is why i got involved in the swimming association in american samoa to hopefully get more people comfortable in the water safe in the water
4688481 i enjoy working with people and learning about different communities ive learned so much about the world from having lived in guatemala jamaica and american samoa i wouldnt trade that for all the money you could get working in corporate america
4688482 a handful of people going out and teaching kids to swim on the weekend
4688483 thats what wins ballgames you can go back to the dodgers in the 60s thats what wins its not offense when we pitch good when they give us a chance weve got enough offense to find a way to score some runs
4688484 i used to get carried away with who was pitching and what the matchups are
4688485 the reality is crazy things happen all the time lincecum is out there shoving it up our rear next thing you know brad ausmus hits a line drive off his knee cap and were in their bullpen and we score eight runs in the seventh inning anything can happen
4688486 today is going to come quick and we have a tough one on sunday weve got to turn around pretty quickly and find that fire again
4688487 what ive learned is anybody can get me out and i can hit anybody
4688488 i dont care if hes the greatest pitcher on the planet or seemingly the worst pitcher in the major leagues hanging on by a thread so you learn from playing dont let the name on the back of the guys jersey put you behind the eight ball before you even go out there and compete

4688491 we werent going to win every game for the rest of the year so we have to regroup and try to come back out and win tonight
4688492 when youre going against a guy like webb its going to be tough anyway we just didnt play well
4688493 the way im going every home run feels kind of special right now so i cant really say that one feels extra special
4688494 obviously it was a good game webby was great and it was sure nice to get him a big lead and i was happy to be able to tack on
4688495 i was missing every pitch i threw i didnt know what was going to happen it was very difficult
4688496 just not a good night of attacking the strike zone wandy had problems putting it in the zone and didnt have his curveball either it was a tough night for him and when youre facing a guy like brandon webb its awfully tough
4688497 i was getting ahead of most of the hitters and if not i was coming right back and evening up the count i was pretty aggressive in the strike zone and i was able to keep the ball on the ground for the most part i dont know if it was my best outing but it was pretty good
4688498 he got through the second inning pretty good and we got one run in the bottom of the first half and i was like here we go
4688499 poland by deploying the system is exposing itself to a strike 100 percent

4688505 what we do know is that we have a shooting and we have a man dead in the middle of the street
4688506 i think the veterans who have been here through the years i think they were shocked just what happened and how could that happen to him
4688507 he was always very pleasant to the staff got along with everybody the students liked him the students who had his class always liked mr bush

4688523 american airlines continues to execute its fleet renewal plan to control costs while prudently reinvesting in the travel experience for customers
4688524 replacing md 80s with 737s at current fuel prices provides financial benefits while enhancing the customer experience
4688525 boeing and american airlines have enjoyed a partnership that spans more than 50 years back to the beginning of the commercial jet age todays announcement continues that long and successful history
4688526 these additional next generation 737s will enhance americans fleet with newer more efficient airplanes lowering fuel costs and lessening the environmental impact of flying
4688527 these product enhancements are more evidence of the additional customer benefits we are creating through our collaboration with edelweiss air
4688528 edelweiss air is already well established in the swiss market and will now also be offering our swiss customers its top class product in the leisure travel field
4688529 we believe our proposed cooperation is an important step towards ensuring that we can compete effectively with rival alliances and manage through the challenges of record fuel prices and growing economic concerns in addition we believe we will be more effective competitors with greater ability to invest in our products and services as a result this business agreement will create positive outcomes for our customers shareholders employees and the communities we serve
4688530 this strategic relationship strengthens competition by providing consumers with easier journeys to more destinations with better aligned schedules and frequencies we are applying for eu u s antitrust immunity in a changed regulatory world where london heathrow is open to any u s or eu airline that wants to fly to the united states and where rival alliances have immunity
4688531 customers will benefit the most from this relationship as they will have better connections to more destinations around the world it will increase competition as the three global airline alliances will play under the same rules we are taking a very important step towards consolidation which is necessary in todays aviation industry

4688617 it appears to me that direct arguments against christianity and theism produce hardly any effect on the public and freedom of thought is best promoted by the gradual illumination of mens minds which follows from the advance of science
4688618 if we believe absurdities we shall commit atrocities i cannot imagine a god who rewards and punishes the objects of his creation whose purposes are modeled after our own a god in short who is but a reflection of human frailty neither can i believe that the individual survives the death of his body although feeble souls harbor such thoughts through fear or ridiculous egotism faith means not wanting to know what is true
4688619 i cannot believe in the immortality of the soul no all this talk of an existence for us as individuals beyond the grave is wrong it is born of our tenacity of life our desire to go on living our dread of coming to an end
4688620 the bible is not my book nor christianity my profession i could never give assent to the long complicated statements of christian dogma
4688621 religion is a byproduct of fear for much of human history it may have been a necessary evil but why was it more evil than necessary isnt killing people in the name of god a pretty good definition of insanity

4688678 so when youve got science that the hypothesis doesnt explain evidence then the hypothesis doesnt stand anymore it doesnt mean theres a new hypothesis youve validated it just means the governments explanation of the jet fuel fire is not a sufficient explanation to explain the evidence of these spheres these microscopic spheres that steven jones has proved existed within the w t c dust

4688691 the priorys tradition of perpetuating goddess worship is based on a belief that powerful men in the early christian church conned the world by propagating lies that devalued the female and tipped the scales in favor of the masculine
4688692 i ts important to remember that the ancients view of sex was entirely opposite from ours today sex begot new life the ultimate miracle and miracles could be performed only by a god the ability of the woman to produce life from her womb made her sacred a god intercourse was the revered union of the two halves of the human spirit male and female through which the male could find spiritual wholeness and communion with god m ankinds use of sex to commune directly with god posed a serious threat to the catholic power base it left the church out of the loop undermining their self proclaimed status as the sole conduit to god for obvious reasons they worked hard to demonize sex and recast it as a disgusting and sinful act other major religions did the same

4688704 what you wont hear from this campaign or this party is the kind of politics that uses religion as a wedge and patriotism as a bludgeon that see our opponents not as competitors to challenge but enemies to demonize because we may call ourselves democrats and republicans but are americans first we are always americans first

4688715 thats blatantly wrong anyone who has ever sat through a high school civics class knows that it violates the separation of power between the governor and legislature as intended by the framers of the states constitution
4688716 the amendment is not a referendum on our democratic governor whom the state journal has repeatedly endorsed its a principled vote to stop the current governor and all future governors democrats and republicans from abusing their veto authority with such audacity

4688718 i have worked to make our court more responsive to the needs of the public always mindful of the need to prudently and effectively conserve public resources i have led the establishment of an inmate community service program an expedited truancy court a restorative justice program and a drug and alcohol court i have also made public presentations regarding the issues of domestic abuse and the cycle of violence i would continue to promote programs that would effectively efficiently and economically address the needs of the people of this state
4688719 as the court has recently stated publicly the court system would benefit greatly if the legislature would pass realistic meaningful public financing of supreme court elections as a means of protecting a nonpartisan neutral detached and impartial judiciary meeting the courts budgetary needs as a whole would also improve the operations of the court we have recently started meeting regularly with various legislative committees in an effort to improve relations between the court and the legislature

4688727 this is a pretty standard way to do tax reforms in social security
4688728 if we kept the payroll tax exactly the same but applied it to all earnings and not just the first 97 500 we could virtually eliminate the entire social security shortfall
4688729 the thing about a doughnut hole is that it is empty
4688730 there is nothing and that it seems is what is left of barack obamas plan to fix social security
4688731 make no mistake what obama is really saying is that at least for the campaign he is walking away from social security and all of its problems

4688744 i decided i should do a bit of swimming to keep me fit because i was doing a lot of partying as you do in a ski resort
4688745 we hardly spoke for about six months it was just hello goodbye when are you swimming next then i went to some running races with them and it kind of developed from there
4688746 the run comes easiest to me if you dont have that water feeling from childhood the swim is a lot of work

4688774 the only sure way to tell if something is ready for harvest is to sample it
4688775 size and color usually are good indicators but even veteran gardeners can be fooled

4688780 if it gets too big it can get too soft but the more you harvest the more the plants fruit for you
4688781 clip the outer leaves with a knife or scissors just above the ground
4688782 it fills out again quickly and you can make many return visits before the plant is done youll know when because the leaves will start tasting bitter
4688783 of all the crops one can grow melons keep the best secrets about their own ripeness but there are ways of cracking the code
4688784 muskmelons for example ripen on the vine but not off so they dont get any sweeter after picking gardeners should be looking to harvest when their muskmelons slip from the vines when gentle pressure is applied to the stem
4688785 for years i suffered with a chronic condition known as irritable bowel syndrome ibs doctors and medications failed but eliminating a few foods and additives from my diet completely solved the problem as a result i became an avid reader of packaged food labels this was time consuming confusing and often misleading i looked for an easier solution but none existed thats when the idea for labelwatch was conceived

4688806 just go weigh yourself youll see something that will excite you on the scale
4688807 ho dato il massimo arrivando a 10 secondi dal mio personale per non mi posso ritenere soddisfatto non ho retto il cambio di ritmo
4688808 devo ammettere che mi hanno sorpreso dice brugnetti alla fine della gara pensavo di poter continuare la mia progressione lenta ma duratura alla fine per ho concluso a 10 secondi dal mio personale quindi non mi posso lamentare con un tempo simile 1 1951
4688809 il suo stile era ottimo dice poi il tecnico di brugnetti antonio la torre speriamo che poi non si scopra che lui non era pulito
4688810 non ho nulla da rimproverarmi questo sia chiaro per non mi posso ritenere soddisfatto credo di aver finalmente interpretato una gara nel modo giusto e non pensavo proprio che qualcuno potesse cambiare il ritmo come ha fatto il russo gi perez aveva dato uno strattone alla gara poco prima ma avevo tenuto bene quando invece partito borchin io non ho retto
4688811 questo sicuro continua brugnetti anche perch se penso alla coppa del mondo poco pi di due mesi fa quando sono arrivato sedicesimo non posso far altro che ritenermi soddisfatto forse mi mancata qualche gara in pi nelle gambe ma di certo ho dato il massimo peccato che appunto arrivando a 10 secondi dal mio personale mi debba accontentare di un quinto posto allolimpiade
4688812 non ci penso proprio conclude brugnetti adesso mi godo 10 giorni di vacanza con moglie e figlie poi sar di nuovo pronto ad allenarmi e penso gi ai mondiali di berlino tra un anno ma anche a londra tra 4 ho un po il dente avvelenato e so di poter dire ancora molto in questa gara dopo oggi ho una nuova consapevolezza del mio valore
4688813 ha difeso il titolo olimpico da vero campione forse serviva avere qualche gara in pi nelle gambe ed un pelo di tenuta in pi per stato bello anche vedergli versare delle lacrime alla fine che sono lacrime di rabbia da quello che si visto in gara credo che lordine darrivo sia giusto ma quello che mi fa piacere sapere che oggi abbiamo visto un nuovo brugnetti ivano pi consapevole del suo valore non fa pi gare folli andando allattacco come lo scorso anno ai mondiali e ha finito alla grande la sua seconda met di gara quando si fatto staccare lha finita pi forte della prima 4042
4688814 se penso ai due mesi che son stato fermo dice rubino sono molto soddisfatto ma allo stesso tempo mi dispiace perch senza quello stop potevo fare di pi
4688815 ma anche in una qualsiasi gara di alto livello come europei o mondiali per me la vera olimpiade stata quella di riuscire a venire ho dato il massimo l quindi oggi in gara non credo che poteva andar meglio per vedo questo come un inizio e spero che alla prossima occasione mi guadagno prima la qualificazione cos mi posso concentrare per fare il grande evento da protagonista

4688856 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4688857 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4688858 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4688859 i started calling all these people and everybody was talking to me like i was crazy theyre like well he hasnt won yet but im like yes he has because hes gotten this far
4688860 so what gives me tears is if barack obama wins kids are going to say that a black man can be president too
4688861 i think it will give so many people black latin asian even white people that feel forgotten hope i did not think i would see it in my lifetime and im only 34
4688862 with barack obama his becoming president is them becoming president because michelle was there from the beginning
4688863 re re re re re re re re all right well call me later
4688864 its 4 a m i cant sleep someone talk to me
4688865 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
4688866 the presidents action underscores the importance of congresss attention to this matter in 2006 we secured a law that opened substantial areas to development while also protecting the eastern gulf of mexico until 2022 even with this announcement that protection remains
4688867 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
4688868 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
4688869 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
4688870 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
4688871 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
4688872 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
4688873 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
4688874 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
4688875 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
4688876 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
4688877 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
4688878 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
4688879 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
4688880 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
4688881 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
4688882 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
4688883 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
4688884 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
4688885 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
4688886 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy
4688887 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
4688888 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
4688889 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
4688890 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
4688891 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
4688892 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
4688893 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
4688894 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort
4688895 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
4688896 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10
4688897 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
4688898 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
4688899 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built
4688900 i will continue doing all that i can to ensure the health care needs of bay countys veterans retired and active duty personnel and their families are being met and that a new facility remains a priority for the navy and va
4688901 lets keep our fingers crossed for tomorrow hopefully theyll still have one when i get down here after work
4688902 theyre abstract and metaphoric so people can get what they want from it
4688903 i want them to break it down in their cars late at night or in their high school or college classrooms
4688904 dont cut me down because im soaring and this is my message now join me
4688905 the broad range of people ive worked with on this proves that its about the human experience
4688906 there are definitely a handful of tracks that address latino or chicano rights issues
4688907 this is as much for the white middle class male as it is for the single third world female
4688908 so it makes sense to support him its nice to support someone who grew up here graduated here and went to uw
4688909 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
4688910 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
4688911 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
4688912 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
4688913 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
4688914 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
4688915 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
4688916 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
4688917 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent
4688918 hes a man with a plan got a counterfeit dollar in his hand hes misstra know it all
4688919 ladies protect yourselves without a prenup a court can give half of your money to your ex husband
4688920 a prenup is a safety net in case a divorce occurs if no divorce occurs and you have a prenup you will know the assets and debt your partner has before marriage you will see how they fight when it comes to money and it will strengthen your relationship
4688921 i felt like i had command of pretty much everything tonight

4688929 norman gershman has become accustomed to the reactions from people who see his photos and read his stories about muslims sheltering jews and saving their lives during the holocaust
4688930 i traveled all through albania and kosovo where i met the rescuers children who are in their sixties or even older the rescuers widows and in some cases the rescuer himself
4688931 the premier of the film worldwide is expected in 2009
4688932 i am proud and happy to show this story to the world
4688933 besa is a tribal albanian culture that goes back to thousands of years
4688934 what besa says is that if some one knocks on your door you have an absolute obligation no matter who that person is to save their lives
4688935 in fact albania is the only nazi occupied country that sheltered jews
4688936 they came in as guests they were given muslim names they were living with muslim families
4688937 i remember that some of them said there is no besa without the quran
4688938 they did this in the name of their religion they absolutely had no prejudice what so ever
4688939 i asked them why did you do this what was in the quran that you did this they would only smile
4688940 some of them said we have saved lives to go to paradise
4688941 in one way its a small story because we are not talking about hundreds of thousands of people being saved but its an important story
4688942 it says that there are good people in the world and they come from every religion
4688943 my message to the western world is that there are so many good people in the world and so many of them are muslims
4688944 if you see my pictures and the stories there is no question that these are good people
4688945 i defy if anybody sees my pictures especially in the west and say that these people are militants or supporters of violence
4688946 to me islam is poetry is science is to be with the divine islam is beauty

4688952 same shit yeah this day was f ked up too
4688953 todav a estoy presa pero siento que de alguna manera se est abriendo la justicia y espero que se cumpla lo que tiene que ser lo real la libertad tiene que llegar porque aqu no hay nada que tenga que ver con esos asaltos y la verdad sigo pensando que hay todo un sistema extra o que todav a no logro entender
4688954 no es el camino de justicia que debe haber en chile
4688955 el m nimo exigible era que guardaran a un personaje tan nefasto en el s tano hasta su muerte
4688956 los sistemas penales no deben inventar ning n m todo pues todos los que utilizan ya se construyeron en democracia para perseguir a las clases peligrosas
4688957 esta situaci n viene d ndose hace mucho tiempo atr s y se les ha notificado y dado tiempo para realizar los cambios correspondientes pero ellos s lo han respondido con promesas incumplidas es por eso que anunciamos que estamos dispuestos a recuperar nuestra escuela y se hace el llamado a todas las instituciones mapuche presente en el wall mapu ha colaborar en este proceso
4688958 el pueblo chiquitano ejerci su derecho ciudadano y fue a votar masivamente en el refer ndum ahora tenemos como un desaf o grande la aprobaci n y puesta en vigencia de la nueva constituci n pol tica del estado donde se reconocen varias de nuestras demandas y que de una vez se respeten nuestros derechos como pueblos ind genas
4688959 este domingo 10 de agosto durante el refer ndum revocatorio en el cant n de santa rosa de la roca municipio de san ignacio de velasco nuestros hermanos y hermanas que asistieron a votar y participar como delegados para vigilar la transparencia de la consulta fueron insultados y expulsados del lugar de votaci n por los miembros del comit c vico
4688960 un grupo de c vicos que apoyan al prefecto de santa cruz comenzaron a amedrentar a nuestros compa eros y compa eras ind genas para que voten a favor del prefecto e incluso los amenazaron para que muestren la papeleta de votaci n para saber por qui n votaban
4688961 vamos a denunciar este hecho a todo el pa s y ante la organizaci n estados americanos oea para que sepan que en la chiquitania cada vez hay menos democracia pues por pensar diferente o defender los derechos empiezan a perseguir y amenazar a nuestros hermanos ind genas
4688962 nosotros creemos que esta situaci n de persecuci n va a continuar y por eso tenemos que denunciar lo que pasa y exigir a las autoridades que hagan cumplir la ley nosotros lo nico que hacemos es ejercer nuestros derechos reconocidos por la constituci n y la leyes de bolivia

4688968 que nuevamente el estado de chile a trav s de su pol tica de represi n hace caso omiso de los derechos y garant as carcelarias justamente ganadas por nuestros weichafe en su categor a de presos pol ticos quienes han liderado importantes procesos de lucha de nuestro pueblo y que hoy en d a se encuentran injustamente encarcelados
4688969 aunque en reas diferentes a las que dedic juan porque su calidad de jurista y constitucionalista est n fuera de mi alcance
4688970 la gran mayor a de los chilenos hoy vive y trabaja en paz las grandes personalidades y poderosos del pa s circulan sin guardaespaldas gracias al trabajo que se hizo en la poca del ex presidente patricio aylwin cuando se desarticul a los grupos armados
4688971 con el voto de la ley de delaci n una pol tica de seguridad se puso en marcha la oficina reclutaba los prisioneros pol ticos al interior y fuera de las prisiones era gente que estaba quebrada psicol gicamente y que ten an problemas econ micos se les ofrec a trabajo y dinero a cambio de informaci n

4688975 hab a que neutralizar la acci n de grupos que no operaban en el marco de la ley hacerlo de manera civilizada para estar a la cabeza de un organismo as cualquier cuadro del ps habr a aceptado
4688976 toda democracia debe tener un servicio secreto no hay nada sorprendente en esto pero el fin no justifica todos los medios
4688977 en lugar de utilizar agentes de estado ellos utilizaron prisioneros pol ticos y sus familias
4688978 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades
4688979 we are trying to do something positive with our lives
4688980 i like this place it is a cool spot to chill
4688981 it is too early to say but this summer has given us a good history to work with
4688982 to talk about what went right and what went wrong
4688983 it gives them something to do and they are not in the streets getting into trouble
4688984 i can drop off my son and not worry about his safety
4688985 somos capaces porque somos dignos y orgullosos de cuidar y defender la tierra en qu vivimos no le robamos ni le quitamos nada a nadie para existir en nuestra comunidad pero quienes est n robando son las empresas extranjeras que con nuestros recursos naturales se est n llevando grandes utilidades

4688992 theres no question that the arroyo the intelligence have dug up in modern underground music has led us down a path wed probably never get to without them theyve taken up the reins of art pop clamor with a sound that breezes far past the maelstrom of noise oriented bands that perpetuate their message with more aggro forms of tuneage a la some of their predecessors the birthday party or even more loosely throbbing gristle just to name a couple
4688993 it has been tough for us to become integrated in the french market
4688994 the focus we had at the beginning was to open more stores and to get suppliers and we were attacked because we had this image of globalisation
4688995 a cosy place with nice warm colours with free wireless where you might like to stay for an hour
4688996 its not a gourmet burger but its a big slice of beef with an old fashioned mustard sauce which is stronger than the standard english or american sauces and closer to the traditional french mustard tastes it was only introduced as a test but its never been off the menu and its second only to the big mac now
4688997 buying a pair of shoes does not involve disruptive or intense emotions nothing here encourages us to share this experience with others
4688998 let me smile in your face while i lift your wallet
4688999 its quiet its focused and i think its something that connects me to the divine or with god or with whatever you want to say because its creative
4689000 i felt there was something better about waking up and accomplishing something in a day than finishing late and waking up hurting the next day
4689001 bread is essentially a balance between your solid your flour and moisture he says
4689002 if you get the proportions wrong you wind up with a disaster on your hands
4689003 he really took off it wasnt long before we trusted him to start making fires and coming in at 4 oclock in the morning
4689004 if you can squish it a little bit with your fingers and it crackles then its good
4689005 when you allow yourself to invest in something and be a part of something then you have to let it go

4689009 but mom its just a tv show i didnt mean that
4689010 baby listen to me i understand that you dont know what this means shape shifting body switching astral projection are all forms of witchcraft i am not mad at you im not fussing at you i want you to understand that satan uses little cute shows and other things like this to open doors into your mind and when you let him in he can bring in even more things

4689016 la argentina depende fundamentalmente del campo y de lo que sucede en el campo
4689017 so you are considering a kind of co presidency is that it
4689018 well governor why dont you issue a statement saying that you didnt say that
4689019 i cant take bush because of his condemnation of my economic policy as voodoo economics which hes never retracted and because of the abortion stand
4689020 if i can get george bush to agree to indorse that platform in its entirety without reservation would you at least then re consider george bush
4689021 well if you put it that way yes i would re consider wouldnt commit but would re consider
4689022 you know im going to get my roommate hes a little overweight
4689023 hes started eating healthier im going to go get him and come back down
4689024 they take my food stamp card here and this is where i go
4689025 how awesome is that when do you see hummus in a corner convenience store
4689026 we live here seven days a week 14 hours a day
4689027 its like our other house and my customers are like my other family we see them every day
4689028 i just told him he needs to get me some cinnamon toast crunch
4689029 they got all of this wic cereal in there and my kids wont eat that stuff
4689030 if it works out we could do it five days a week
4689031 and then of course theres the competition about zucchini and chocolate chip cookies or zucchini and this zucchini and that
4689032 you grow good produce of any kind i dont care whether its fruit or vegetables people will buy it
4689033 its fun to write a little sign to tell people this food came from a couple hundred yards a way
4689034 people want to fill their table with things that are local and that have a story behind them
4689035 and when its a fifteen year old kid you probably give them a little sweeter deal than you would to a farm
4689036 some people can read a book or go on the internet and get the information and know exactly what to do but im the kind of person that needs somebody to actually guide me
4689037 tomatoes over my head cabbages bigger than my head cauliflower bigger than my head
4689038 i say yeah its good you want it and they say yes
4689039 la legitimidad y normalidad del acto plebiscitario reafirma la consolidaci n del proceso democr tico boliviano y la solidez de sus instituciones
4689040 others should be free to govern their school districts as they see fit
4689041 unless pursuant to the written regulations or written authorization of the institution
4689042 one accident and i dont know how the school board would live with themselves
4689043 its right up there with worst ideas in the history of modern education
4689044 we could end up arming half the gangs in houston
4689045 it is foolish to introduce more weapons into the school environment even under the guise of wanting to provide better protection for our students
4689046 staff would have to be constantly concerned with weapon security and retention thus taking away from their ability to focus on their main goal teaching students in the event of a crisis there is no manageable way to integrate armed staff into the crisis response plan
4689047 they sound a little bit more paranoid than they need to be
4689048 but if theyre looking for notoriety they certainly stirred it up
4689049 ive been constantly watching him hes one of my main idols
4689050 i dont know how he does it but he does it
4689051 im trying to make my butterfly stroke like his he doesnt bring his hands all the way together like ive been trained
4689052 watching him makes me want to get into the water
4689053 hes humble hes close to his family and his swimming coach i try to live my life like he does
4689054 i eat about 6 000 i eat two lunches and i make a dinner for myself when i get home and then i eat a second dinner usually pasta and then i eat dinner with my family
4689055 its unclear what the motives were why they were meeting
4689056 it had something to do with money but its unclear whether one owed money or was trying to sell something
4689057 it was his case from the get go and he never let go of it
4689058 the skateboard kid who worked at sonic could become so responsible
4689059 a perfect example of someone who always puts everyone else first
4689060 we just did what we were supposed to do no big deal
4689061 open to change and able to implement the kind of reforms that are necessary
4689062 no queremos que sea una firma m s de la que muchos han firmado sino que nos preocuparemos d a a d a hora tras hora de que este convenio pueda llegar a su etapa final lo que se recupere aqu no es para hacerlo picadillo de cebolla sino que ser algo hist rico para el pueblo mapuche
4689063 hemos recuperado la totalidad del espacio que ocupaba la fuerza a rea y estamos con la parte t cnica con nuestros asesores que es el observatorio de derechos de pueblos ind genas y con los ejecutivos del gobierno regional para avanzar metro a metro y ac no poemos hablar de bicentenario sino de reinvindicaci n y reconocimiento de nuestros territorios
4689064 la culminaci n de un proceso de conversaci n de dialogo que hemos desarrollado y que ha tenido muchas vivisitudes en el camino los anuncios de la presidenta el 1 de abril son los caminos para dar respuestas a las necesidades que tienen nuestros pueblos
4689065 que quisieramos iniciar con todas las comunidades de nuestro pa s la presidenta bachelet nos ha se alado que este es el camino y las comunidades de maquehue nos enorgullesen porque han entendido y hecho efectiva esta invitaci n estos hechos que parecen peque os van marcando nuestra historia este convenio contiene una serie de iniciativas de inversi n donde nos comprometemos la administraci n p blica los servicios a cumplir los anuncios de la presidenta de este nuevo pacto por el re conocer en este convenio se conjugan valores de participaci n de respeto de sensibilidad social y de compensaci n con los pueblos originarios de la deuda hist rica que tenemos como sociedad
4689066 hoy en las palabras de la propia intendenta el t rmino compensacion fue utilizada y el propio convenio habla de la demanda de recuperaci n territorial
4689067 what is the cost of an intermediate range ballistic missle
4689068 so what the puc says is well if thats what the contract says then youre kind of stuck with it
4689069 if we are talking about a contract that you dont understand you dont have to sign it that minute
4689070 you can take it and show it to anybody you want including a lawyer
4689071 watch for what they call a recurring contract open ended revolving anything that doesnt have a finite date the way to think about this is when you finance your car you know its going to be three four or five years what you have to do on some of these smaller purchases is ask that same question
4689072 most customers dont really bother about that contract until they feel a pain or until they look at the monthly bill and go whoa what in the heck just happened and thats too late
4689073 think of it like your nutritional label on a box of cheez it
4689074 this tells you everything thats in the electricity that you are buying the terms and conditions of a specific rate plan and it tells you the specific electricity rate plan
4689075 in a strange way a cancellation fee is like a restocking charge
4689076 we went through all the trouble of doing something in the belief that we were selling this to you and we want to be reimbursed for that cost
4689077 he presided at every building dedication and every commencement during my 18 years as president events that required a great deal of organization

4689080 the trick with these laws is balancing first amendment rights versus privacy rights
4689081 he took the photos without their consent he was concealed in heavy vegetation we figure he was 150 feet from them he ran from rangers
4689082 we felt that all his behavior indicated that he was trying to arouse sexual desire
4689083 theyd set them down below women in skirts and film they were putting this stuff on the web this bill was prompted by these deviants who wanted to look at womens underwear
4689084 there are questions raised because the beach is a public place and there are questions about whether a beach is an appropriate place to have a camera
4689085 you could read this law to say that such behavior is illegal and it sets itself up for a possible constitutional attack
4689086 the issue becomes whether you can have an expectation of privacy when you are swimming nude at a public place
4689087 the concept of privacy is really diminishing technology is making privacy harder to come by
4689088 the courts are going to have to stipulate where the lines are going to be drawn between first amendment concerns and privacy interests
4689089 este tipo de racismo social y ambiental es una violaci n de derechos humanos y es una forma de discriminaci n que viene agrediendo al medio ambiente la salud biodiversidad la econom a local la calidad de vida y seguridad en nuestras comunidades esta discriminaci n racial es ocasionada por las pol ticas p blicas y privadas y que se manifiesta en la intenci n de que los costos e impactos sean asumidos por nosotros los mapuches junto a la exclusi n manifiesta en la toma de decisiones que afectan nuestras vidas

4689097 aceptaron la herencia del sistema pinochetista al comienzo por fuerza mayor pero se dieron cuenta que es m s f cil gobernar dentro de un sistema casi dictatorial que dentro de un sistema democr tico donde los gobernantes tienen que justificar sus acciones
4689098 no podemos comparar y lo digo yo que viv muy de cerca recibiendo testimonios durante la dictadura hoy hay un estado de derecho que funciona hay canales para presentar denuncias la gente puede interponer acciones en los tribunales
4689099 el esp ritu del gobierno no es reprimir las manifestaciones sino dejar espacio para la participacion de la ciudadan a y se han dado m ltiples permisos para actividades en la calle
4689100 esper bamos otra actitud del gobierno porque consider bamos a la presidenta bachelet como una militante de los derechos humanos
4689101 pensamos que el aumento de la represi n va paralelo a ese aumento de la organizaci n popular que lleva a que los movimientos sociales empiecen a luchar por sus derechos
4689102 me da mucha rabia que una manifestaci n de 50 personas portando s lo carteles sea disuelta por 200 carabineros en tres minutos
4689103 el conflicto en chile no existe ni debe existir y los incipientes signos de conflictos son perfectamente controlables

4689137 but in retrospect it was unfortunate ive spoken to both the police chief and school superintendent and they both want those officers back in the schools

4689177 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4689178 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4689179 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4689180 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4689181 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

4689200 there is a job to be done and it is a good job because it pays it doesnt really matter what my education was at home the opportunity is here and you take it and you do it and it will work out
4689201 with many immigrants there is this sense that they made this hard choice to leave their homelands and they are going to make it under any cost

4689203 originally it was an alaskan mystery but also i have to be honest with you it was an adventure

4689207 the church is a stabilizing factor in the black community and while we looked at other locations we prayerfully decided to remain in this community

4689211 i took her to church sat her down at the piano and let her be herself
4689212 no one really knew how to make a record when i started
4689213 you simply went into the studio turned on the mic and said play
4689214 she went downstairs and he was standing in the basement
4689215 she had a brief conversation with him but he wasnt going to come out
4689216 there is no issue as to who started the fires but wed certainly like to be able to come up with a motive as to why he would go to this extreme
4689217 do not drive or operate machinery while taking this drug
4689218 as far as the players go there has been some concern there is no doubt about that there has been concern for quite a while now
4689219 we as a cricket team are no different to any other australian i am sure everyday australians that you would bump into in the street would have some concerns as well but the good thing is we are a lot more informed now than we were before the day started
4689220 there are obviously some decisions to be made in the next few days
4689221 its probably 9 or 10 years old since weve known each other
4689222 its always tough its funny to play each other in the semis here we know each other so well what we like and what we dont like
4689223 i was having problems with my timing but when i made a passing shot on a set point i started feeling better
4689224 i enjoy being here with all my fellow artists ones i already knew and ones i hadnt met before theres a lot of talent in our community
4689225 my mom is 80 and her glasses are a hit
4689226 theres so many different artistic talents here thats the best part
4689227 they wanted something different and this came to my mind
4689228 i like the art aspect of it its kind of different
4689229 not in a traditional style but more of a graphic arts style like what you see in a lot of advertising now
4689230 as a species we need interaction with nature for our physical and psychological well being
4689231 take the lollipop out of his mouth you dont want him to fall and choke himself
4689232 the russian army brought in a large number of irregulars mercenaries
4689233 they go around drunk aggressive armed and do all these atrocities
4689234 mr lavrov said that russia would implement the agreement faithfully
4689235 the world has watched with alarm as russia invaded a sovereign neighbouring state and threatened a democratic government elected by its people
4689236 to begin to repair the damage to its relations with the united states europe and other nations and to begin restoring its place in the world russia must act to end this crisis
4689237 it was an experience i will remember for a lifetime
4689238 everybody talks about it and it does live up to the expectations just entering that new stadium the best stadium ive ever been to in my life 90 000 people watching you walk around the spectacle is something i will remember for the rest of my life
4689239 i still get a sick feeling in my stomach thinking about how close we were to advancing one minute away from victory in a 2 2 tie against the netherlands and then a red card early in the nigeria game
4689240 its frustrating because i know we had such a good team and could have done some good things in the tournament
4689241 against real the goal is to try to get to first and then you go from there
4689242 if we win we go to the top which would be an achievement because it has been a slow grind for us
4689243 obviously it was a great experience but our focus is now on mls
4689244 we played in some great stadiums against some great teams
4689245 i gained invaluable experience that will help me the rest of the year with the dynamo
4689246 obviously holden is a bit leggy a bit world weary from the olympics but everyones healthy and it took awhile for us to get that way i think its the first time all year
4689247 everyone who has talked down to us is going to eat their words
4689248 i understand where you are coming from but how many real bigfoot researchers are out there trekking 140 000 miles a year
4689249 just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect
4689250 they dont have a choice to believe us we have a body
4689251 gerhartsreiter is at the center of the longest con ive ever seen in my professional career
4689252 as prosecutors we need more than a photo and a fading memory to walk into court and amend a complaint
4689253 the fbis fingerprint technicians brought science to bear where mere suspicion had prevailed
4689254 it was the most ridiculous press conference ever the familys already identified him
4689255 given the pattern of the thing its not unreasonable for people to ask
4689256 the media and a large chunk of the public including some of johns supporters still question whether hes told the whole truth
4689257 happy to take a paternity test and would love to see it happen
4689258 i feel sorry for his family because how horrible but also dont you think he is the father of the child
4689259 anybody whos been around campaigns knows that folks come and go
4689260 i would only have positive things to say about him as being a helpful friendly and pleasant co worker to a new employee
4689261 they seemed to be crazy about each other they certainly are crazy about their kids and dog
4689262 we all have our ups and we all have our downs and when youre up you reach out and when youre down you allow others to help
4689263 help two friends and former colleagues rebuild their lives when harassment by supermarket tabloids made it impossible for them to move forward on their own
4689264 the more liberal camp just assumes that pastor warren is going to make this a christian litmus test of the presidency others who are more conservative fear he is going to wimp out on some of the issues
4689265 he says neither group understands or knows me hes going to ask tough questions fair questions not gotcha questions
4689266 its a great way for him to do what he can to make connections with not only moderate evangelicals but also the many people out there who read the purpose driven life
4689267 you just wonder is he trying to shoot himself in the foot
4689268 the god strategy how religion became a political weapon in america
4689269 obama is going to make real inroads for people who want to be satisfied that this is a pretty religious guy but that hes not a lunatic
4689270 i think rick is in an unenviable position in that he stands to get attacked from the right and the left based on what direction he takes
4689271 as an evangelical i am much more interested in his list of questions than in either of their answers
4689272 to have a person think in a free manner and then figure out what that is were years away from that
4689273 this will never be used in a way without somebodys real active cooperation
4689274 i really couldnt imagine it working out any other way
4689275 thats the way it was all throughout the regular season this is what id hoped for it couldnt be much of a better situation
4689276 i think its one of the best matchups that the rockingham county leagues seen in a while
4689277 theyve got talent 1 9 in their lineup and we have talent 1 9 in our lineup
4689278 weve got a good pitching staff but theyve got a really good pitching staff thats why its going to be a battle
4689279 id like to play them seven days in a row
4689280 were built to have a seven game playoff well be able to have a good and rested starting pitcher every night
4689281 i know weve been through enough series to know that one game doesnt decide the series
4689282 to me thats the only difference if theres anything i think if theres any advantage its knowing how up and down things can go
4689283 theyre so intelligent about what it takes to win ballgames my guys are still learning theres just a difference between 20 and 30 year olds
4689284 i think itd be an insult to the program if we took this year and rested on last years state championship and were satisfied with mediocrity this year
4689285 so i feel like a big thing is letting everybody know that this program competes at a high level
4689286 the expectation is there that we want to do well
4689287 but its a new team a completely new team and well have to see how they gel
4689288 to play a 3 5 2 your outside backs need to have a lot of speed
4689289 its just a matter of seeing how robert mcconnel or other guys we are looking at there if they can understand that position
4689290 i think one advantage colin has is he played under dillon
4689291 so he gained a lot of knowledge from dillon last year
4689292 and shank and chico did most of the work in the middle but i think im ready for it because coach prepared us really good and the team we had really helped us stay focused
4689293 its big shoes to fill cause mitchell was so good but im gonna do my best and see what i can do
4689294 we feel a little pressure but its something that has to happen
4689295 every team goes through a rebuilding season so i think as the season goes on the pressure will go away and well feel more loose to play our game
4689296 if i was a quarterback or if i was playing another position he probably wouldnt have been as cool with it but its for my future and he was understanding
4689297 we feel dave is one of the top kickers in the nation
4689298 i didnt really know what i was getting myself into
4689299 which might have been good actually because i didnt think too much it was different because i hadnt kicked a ball with anyone running at me for more than two years and i was only kicking maybe once a month maybe so i got sore really quick
4689300 hes seen a whole year experience out on the field his maturity level rises and hes just more confident on the field
4689301 any time you have experience going into those positions you feel a lot better about where you are going into the season
4689302 you dont have to worry about how theyre going to react to pressure weve seen how they react to pressure thats two positions you like to have experienced guys
4689303 thunderfoot is one of the names for him he hits the ball he hits it solid theres just a thud and it goes forever some days it looks like he can hit a 70 yard field goal without a problem
4689304 weve spent a lot of time at camp getting charlie and matt on the same page
4689305 its still a work in progress but every scrimmage it gets better
4689306 we think scottys the best kickoff return guy in the nation
4689307 i want pat riley if i can get him but he may not be available
4689308 plamo tsukurou custom scratchbuild figure tutorial 1 9 sp 6
4689309 at this point the storm is too far away and its path is too uncertain
4689310 ill cross that road at the end when it comes down to it
4689311 its definitely close to home but we have a good situation here in milwaukee and have a chance to win a championship
4689312 failed to attend any talk shows or telephonic or in person interviews
4689313 true communication is possible only between equals because inferiors are more consistently rewarded for telling their superiors pleasant lies than for telling the truth a central tenet of discordianism often invoked by hackers to explain why authoritarian hierarchies screw up so reliably and systematically the effect of the s n a f u principle is a progressive disconnection of decision makers from reality
4689314 the fundamental cause of trouble in the world today is that the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt
4689315 those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities
4689316 the important thing in writing is the capacity to astonish not shock shock is a worn out word but astonish

4689318 free student centered doctoral conceding institution devoted to brilliance in serving the educational desires of the varied population of texas in the world and beyond
4689319 well probably see more people in one weekend than well see walk through our business doors in a year
4689320 the guy wants them and the woman doesnt want to see them
4689321 were seeing more and more green products coming from manufacturers
4689322 who would have thought a few years ago that you could buy green counter tops we also have exhibitors offering bamboo flooring also considered a green product
4689323 i think well get a lot of lookers a lot of people who are anticipating remodeling their homes
4689324 and he wants to pass those opportunities on its a perfect fit
4689325 this tournament means a lot not just to me but to the community around here and in the kids up in allentown pennsylvania
4689326 i just want to them to experience what we take for granted around here
4689327 well be full for next year as soon as we get done on saturday
4689328 the bad thing about it is that youve got to turn people away
4689329 you can only have so many people in this event
4689330 p g 400 os l gicos consideram a hierarquia dos conceitos como dada nas coisas e imediatamente exprim vel pela cadeia imposta de silogismos

4689334 we will definitely look into who it was and how he is making the money
4689335 at my age you see all that cash i just grabbed it and left and i didnt think anything of it
4689336 i wouldnt do something like that to anybody and wouldnt think anybody would do it to me
4689337 he didnt want to cry in front of the cop
4689338 when it was just me and him on the way home he showed his emotions he just started to cry
4689339 i think he just made it up off the top of his head
4689340 youre going to see a lot more of the minor sports teams on street corners doing car washes and bake sales
4689341 its hard for them to raise that kind of money were going to survive this we could have been hurt a whole lot more
4689342 you have to work pretty hard to get what you get
4689343 weve bagged groceries at a couple of the local grocery stores but thats one of the things thats so difficult at northview its not like you can drive a couple of minutes and theres a business
4689344 thats always made it difficult for us weve never had a city that calls us theirs
4689345 we had to do a little bit of fundraising before but since the funds have been cut well have to do a lot more
4689346 most of the parents have been talking to the coaches about what to do weve come up with a few suggestions like selling tickets to raffles
4689347 times are tough for everybody and im sure its going to be tougher this year
4689348 the more teams that go to state the more money you need to have we leave that up to the coaches have them tell us what they want from us well do pretty much whatever they need
4689349 weve always tried to keep anywhere from 8 to 10 percent as holdback money
4689350 basically whats happened is were eliminating the holdback money to try to keep the cuts from going on the programs themselves when you take that little bit of money they have and youre going to cut that down thats sizable
4689351 we had our coaches meeting at the beginning of the year and we talked about being as conservative as we can especially with things that cost a lot of money like uniforms making sure we take care of every piece of equipment to make it last as long as it can i think eventually this thing is going to turn around were just going to tighten up our boot laces
4689352 eventually it may come to that and it might come that these non revenue sports could be cut out thats going to be a tough decision i dont know how its going to be done
4689353 ive got spare drivers and it seems like the makings of a perfect situation where were able to provide transportation for all our athletic activities all our bands all our choral groups and rotc
4689354 it was the timing of having the surplus drivers who would have been looking for work now ive got something active for them to do
4689355 i am so excited to have been accepted into such a wonderful school to study what i love
4689356 this means i will study with the great concert organist paul jacobs he will guide and instruct me in the art of playing the pipe organ
4689357 christophers acceptance was an amazing affirmation of his talents and his dedication to developing those talents to the best of his ability
4689358 god will use me as an instrument of his will
4689359 i always wanted to play the organ but was told that i must learn the piano first
4689360 there in the halls at juilliard before my audition i prayed that i would be able to bear witness to gods presence and use the musical gift he had given me to the best of my ability
4689361 it was a little daunting even to be in the juilliard building but at the same time it made me feel alive
4689362 i was downstairs in the parents waiting room wondering hoping and praying that the audition was going well
4689363 a lot has changed since the time this church was founded but the essential content of our faith remains
4689364 renewal and recommitment of the values that shaped and formed the first settlers
4689365 the first pensacolians came here with a rich christian tradition
4689366 worship speakers information and resources will be available for all ages to encourage people to become more engaged in their faith to celebrate their faith and to go forth to share christs message of love with the world
4689367 calling it a closing ceremony is kind of a misnomer
4689368 we expect people will continue to celebrate their faith and engage in works of mercy to continue to serve those in need and share christs message with others
4689369 we all need to be renewed from time to time
4689370 every community faces a challenge of renewing itself and returning to its original purpose and original vision
4689371 to return to the source and the first values that were planted here
4689372 i dont want to overreact but i want to be prudent
4689373 so what i think were going to do in the short term is look at the reserve funds eventually
4689374 that saves a considerable amount of money about 800 million
4689375 going forward we will continue to meet the states essential needs and we will stand by the same principles that guided this years budget no increased property taxes no additional borrowing and no expanded gambling
4689376 government cannot demand more from its residents and businesses than they are able to give
4689377 everybody knows we had 4 gas in the last quarter and that inflation has been creeping up
4689378 so thats eating through our sales tax estimates cause were saying people just arent going to be in a position to have a lot of disposable income
4689379 im not tied to anyone and have no special interest
4689380 they are saying that the commissioners cant make decisions and are all about self
4689381 they are tired of their taxes going up and having a hard time opening up new businesses
4689382 the county needs to continue with me because ive done a good job
4689383 kami terperangkap hampir 15 minit sebelum beberapa orang tua yang melalui kawasan terbabit cuba mengawal keadaan dan memberi laluan untuk kami bergerak
4689384 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
4689385 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
4689386 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
4689387 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4689388 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4689389 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4689390 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4689391 for comments so while all comments are still moderated commenting should be a lot easier for you
4689392 we are so busy trying to build our lives in the united states that we often forget to document our story
4689393 we have to get to the national guard base theyll know what to do
4689394 were going to need tanks or something to beat those gigantic red fiends
4689395 we should tell the mayor first and then maybe write a letter to the state senator we cant just go around doing things without telling the leaders of this great nation we have to respect the chain of command we have to
4689396 sick and sinful little perverts touch their tiddlywinks and become like you
4689397 because theres a huge ass on it but im trying to figure out what exactly is coming out of it maybe hes just sitting on a really tiny stool maybe its not a he at all and we can only see half of the stool

4689406 canada will now embark on its own journey on the search for these two vessels which has the allure of an indiana jones mystery
4689407 it was there from the first lap the first turn
4689408 when everyone you talk to says youre going to sweep i try not to listen to it
4689409 just being an american thrower theres always going to be that pressure its u s against the world
4689410 i think it changed my life but not very much
4689411 the shots brutal sometimes its easy sometimes that 16 pound ball feels like it weighs 100 pounds
4689412 i was really sick about three days ago with some gi issues and such
4689413 so im really happy to be feeling as good as i am right now
4689414 i came out and gave it my all this is the olympics she said
4689415 shot everything on my junkie dv camera did motion tracking and comping in after effects and basic sound design in final cut
4689416 the students have worked hard and so have the teachers and staff
4689417 they will do whatever it takes to help all children learn

4689421 it was wonderful to work in tamil films irrespective of the difference in filmmaking styles the acting is very similar to kannada films thankfully i speak both tamil and kannada so language was not a barrier for me
4689422 lakshmi has a very authentic south indian face her face and gestures are very similar to sridevi since she is a dancer already its an added advantage to any of the roles that might require her to dance i think kannada film directors should make more use of her
4689423 lakshmi is a simple and charming girl it just happened that i had to cast her in minchina ota it was during the shoot of the film that she got the opportunity to work in bollywood film we hope her attitude and hard work brings her success in the future
4689424 firstly he had lost to usas james blake in straight sets in the quarter final last evening and soon after his scheduled 9 pm doubles match was delayed by rain for over four hours with the international tennis federation insisting that all matches had to be finished off on the night
4689425 and as though that was not enough after taking a strong 4 1 lead against the indians the rains came down again to defer the tie to the next day naturally he was pissed off
4689426 we thought we would exploit the relative inexperience of wawrinka but federer came in the way of most of the shots being played to him to and returned world class winners
4689427 the way i was shaping up before the fight i knew i could get him
4689428 ab toh gold hi hoga now it will be gold only
4689429 kuch kami rahi toh phir silver ya bronze ho sakta hai lekin medal toh pukka hai if i fall short then it will be silver or bronze but a medal is confirmed
4689430 indeed the hallmark of steimetzs work the quality that makes us trust his testimony may be the unblinking constancy with which his photographs solicit grave interest in particular people without claiming unearned intimacy or insight

4689432 when you see statistics that say that this generation of children will not outlive their parents its our responsibility as a government to start looking at how we can change things
4689433 we believe that thursdays demonstration was the maximum that was left for the student population to express their grievances through democratic means
4689434 it had been the practice of the rajapaksa regime to either use anti democratic methods to suppress peoples democratic agitations or unleash violence on them we believe that students do not resort to this type of agitation as a past time relaxation but because they have reached the end of their tolerance
4689435 what we need to do is ensure that you dont develop an unhealthy dependency on me
4689436 it is very unfortunate what happened to them and i have heard the allegations about me but i dont know whats going on
4689437 i have been training secluded and have barely seen my team mates
4689438 i knew from the start that i was walking for a medal but didnt think i was in contention for the gold
4689439 on the last lap i felt the energy and surged ahead
4689440 i still have to get my teeth fixed and my thumb operated but i can still go
4689441 i think everyones quite amazed that i actually made it here emotionally its such a big thing
4689442 it was very fast and so i was absolutely petrified at the speed and having people around me its been a lot to deal with mentally
4689443 i decided i should do a bit of swimming to keep me fit because i was doing a lot of partying as you do in a ski resort
4689444 we hardly spoke for about six months it was just hello goodbye when are you swimming next then i went to some running races with them and it kind of developed from there
4689445 the run comes easiest to me if you dont have that water feeling from childhood the swim is a lot of work
4689446 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
4689447 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
4689448 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
4689449 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets
4689450 they have to ride out the cycle minimize the losses and maximize profits when the cycle returns you cant restructure a company to avoid that cycle
4689451 yes lady we have two of that movie you want so dont worry i will send it to your city club tomorrow and it will be there monday at least and it will not cost to you any cent more that the original price
4689452 the almighty has done great things for me and holy is his name

4689455 ac se nos ha acusado de ser guarida de aquellos que pertenecen a una clase definida por una palabra que se menciona hasta el hartazgo ltimamente oligarqu a bien saben todos los presentes que esta es antes que propiedad de la iglesia o refugio de cualquier clase es la casa de dios y en ella todos y digo todos son bien recibidos
4689456 as como la gente se debe a dios y tiene ciertas obligaciones con l el rezo diario la visita al templo tambi n uno como gobernante debe cumplir como buen pastor del se or con su pueblo y eso implica no azotar a los que con su esfuerzo dan de comer al pr jimo

4689458 this is the first case that ive seen in my 12 years in a situation where you have patients with legitimate and serious problems who are receiving a drug that is not authorized by the food drug and administration
4689459 we cancelled the show in order to focus on the november contenders show which will be the first time we have done a live contenders show in full direct to tv
4689460 it made no sense to spread ourselves thin on this occasion
4689461 i know a lot of people arent familiar with the organization that much but after theyve been getting all these names signed on here its going to start growing i dont just want to be a part of it i want to make something of it
4689462 i think theyre putting her up to be the face of their 135 pound division and ill be fighting at 145 so i doubt that fight would ever happen but i plan on being the face of the 145 pound division
4689463 other promotions theyre doing catch weights that arent really even a division
4689464 theyre doing 140s and basically kind of trying to fit whatever these two particular women have to create a match for them
4689465 when the afl starts doing weight classes i think thats going to be good its going to give distinct weight classes and so people are going to know what they need to come in at
4689466 some people crack under it but im one who i think thrives on it im not one to buckle
4689467 my game plan is going to go one fight at a time win my first fight and then focus on the next one and the next one i plan on having when people think of 145 they think of me
4689468 i want to thank my family teammates coaches and everyone at nor cal theyre the ones that push and support me now
4689469 if anyone wants to sponsor me for the fight i totally have room for sponsors
4689470 nada hace m s feliz al diablo que ver la poca ropa de las mujeres en las olimpiadas

4689472 eight are confirmed dead all adults and more than 60 people injured have been taken to a local hospital
4689473 we have evacuated the victims and now authorities are trying to move damaged carriages
4689474 the cause of the accident is under investigation there are several factors including brake problem or the train got on the wrong track
4689475 when i did take that extra half stroke i thought id lost the race im really sort of lost for words
4689476 i feel a little bit of everything relief excitement everything
4689477 i just ran the first 50 metres then i looked up to make sure i was safe and i shut it off
4689478 i am touched by the support this is an overwhelming support
4689479 we want change the future is anwar long live anwar
4689480 i am so moved by the villagers who came out so early in the morning to show their support
4689481 i have known the people here and they know what to expect from me if i am elected i am after all a two term assemblyman and i have been doing my work since way back
4689482 i know anwar well we have been friends and i look forward to taking him on
4689483 permatang pauh is in the eyes of the world now it is their voters destiny to put anwar on track to become the next prime minister
4689484 they are afraid of me being an mp and going on to become the opposition leader in parliament

4689488 foi sensacional se pudesse voltar atr s no tempo n o mudaria nada agora sou campe o ol mpico
4689489 isso algo que voc imagina quando crian a mas que pensava que seria dif cil de conseguir
4689490 durante dez anos trabalhei por isso e n o pude consegui la a medalha de ouro estou feliz por ter encontrado algu m que possa consegui la por mim
4689491 ele tem um enorme talento uma grande f em si mesmo e as habilidades necess rias para que vencesse a prova
4689492 were going to prepare for it and make a run at it as a team itll make the season more enjoyable
4689493 with only one division it was very hard for the smaller schools to get out of the district
4689494 with the split more girls will be able to share the experience of a state tournament
4689495 our whole season hinges on finding that no 4 score
4689496 erika asher and taylor cook are competing to fill out our lineup the addition of the new division will be fairer for the smaller schools like us
4689497 laura has worked hard on building up her strength in the offseason and shes gained some distance off the tee
4689498 she has a very good short game a great work ethic and golf mind shes down to earth and helps her teammates seeing things i dont see
4689499 i challenged myself and competed in harder tournaments this summer it gave me a lot of experience facing pressure situations and different shots it gives me confidence knowing ive been in these situations a million times before
4689500 grace has alot of upside a ton of natural ability
4689501 she fired a 35 in a recent practice and can shoot anywhere from 36 to 42 i shared her with the tennis team the last two years but this season she is strictly devoted to golf
4689502 shes very long off the tee and turns par 5s into par 4s once she becomes consistent with her short game she certainly has potential to be one of the top three or four in southwest ohio
4689503 after confirming with the victims and the detectives who investigated the case we were satisfied with this outcome because he will never be able to practice again
4689504 maybe we could do torchwood sex toys i will suggest it
4689505 we had built the sets and designed costumes but we couldnt seem to find a sonic screwdriver anywhere as the play is about time travel we really needed the prop which is seen in doctor who shows

4689512 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
4689513 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
4689514 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
4689515 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
4689516 i never thought you were out of that race that is a tribute to your greatness were so proud of you i am happy to keep company with you
4689517 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up

4689548 i think there are an awful lot of people now misusing drugs lots of them out of ignorance because they are completely unaware of the consequences of drug use
4689549 i think suffolk is the same as everywhere else in the uk and is not isolated from all the other problems that affect young people throughout the uk
4689550 it is as prone to drug problems as anywhere else in the country we have lots of young people disenfranchised and feeling hopeless for the future and with easy access to drugs
4689551 what is needed is far more honest and proper education around drugs it is extremely hard to find a school in suffolk which admits that any of its pupils take drugs as a result of that there is not a proper drug education in schools it needs to be more than just saying drugs are bad
4689552 it is good to receive a report which puts together drug misuse statistics in one place
4689553 suffolk drug and alcohol action team daat a partnership of local authorities police nhs suffolk and other groups will be reviewing this document to see how we compare to other equivalent daats suffolk homes

4689556 we had a meeting of the travel group on tuesday there were a few things not in place for the friendly that will be in place for the huddersfield game

4689561 we try to cover absolutely everything a week before the game
4689562 some guys had been doing it in their bath tubs at home and it worked
4689563 last time i looked we dont put bad teams on our schedule
4689564 this is probably the hardest or second hardest schedule since ive been here
4689565 if you had one of these on the battlefield there is no place that the enemy is safe to hide
4689566 we may be able to engage a target that you could not otherwise engage
4689567 it was not a demonstration of a new military system that has been shown to be operationally effective that you could depend on in battle
4689568 then the question is are you going to use it instead of bullets
4689569 its very tough to beat an ordinary rifle in terms of laser power
4689570 for example is there enough power in the laser to melt through the armor of an enemy tank if not then what good is it
4689571 oh my god thats awesome i have to tape that
4689572 and the toilet overflowed but i fixed it and put some towels down and got most of it up
4689573 those two spare rags we use to clean the pet cages that used to be hand towels
4689574 you are fixing the bathroom as soon as you get home do not fall asleep
4689575 but i put the lid down so when you get home just flush it and if nothing happens its fine
4689576 i used yahoos webpages for years and when i found google pages i fell in love with the ease with which i can build simple sites just for friends and family as part of our holiday newsletters and havent gone back to yahoo since so i would be really really bummed if google got rid of their pages
4689577 there were people at capcom who told me not to make this game
4689578 it was confirmed she has withdrawn from the olympics and will not be traveling to beijing
4689579 este es un disco heavy y puede llegar a enganchar de inmediato pero tambi n tiene momentos que se acercan mas al rock and roll lo que que hace de este trabajo algo muy divertido

4689582 mid suffolk district council have never charged rent and never formalised this land as allotments
4689583 but this site has been in use for 20 years with seven plots there allotments are our only facility in harleston and we are about to lose that too they will be irreplaceable and allotment holders are up in arms about this
4689584 the land is full of vegetables at the moment and i believe the authority is taking legal action to get them off i am extremely disappointed
4689585 harleston has not got any facilities no school no surgery no post office no shop not even streetlights
4689586 we have an extended family with our daughter and her son living with us and my parents locally it the allotment is a godsend especially with the current cost of food
4689587 this is a loss to the village we are a very small community and a lot of houses do not have gardens
4689588 we have to take account of what the local community wants there does need to be a balance and there is a need for affordable housing but i do not like to see allotments disappearing after so many years
4689589 i have done a levels in french and german and i did a short course in gcse spanish
4689590 there was a choice between germany france and spain and i said i didnt mind which one i did but i was so pleased to get germany i really love my german
4689591 a lot of it was very hard when they wanted something done it was a case of drop everything and do it
4689592 at one time they wanted some hotels booked but because of a festival there was literally no hotels with any room
4689593 it could be quite frustrating at times but some of the tasks were fun like making wombat costumes and organising a typically german party for them
4689594 i have always thought about teaching languages and i want to pass on my passion for languages to other people but i think this has made me think more about the music industry or doing pa work there are so many different opportunities
4689595 theres been talks about bringing the character back so well see if that happens or not
4689596 maybe from an outsider looking in its like oh theres another one shes doing the same thing but it really isnt

4689626 again she thought of a pear not the everyday gritty kind that hung on the tree in the backyard but the kind sold on trains and at high prices each pear with a paper cone wrapping it alone beautiful symmetrical clean pears with thin skins with snow white flesh so juicy and tender that to eat one baptized the whole face and so delicate that while you urgently ate the first half the second half was already beginning to turn brown to all fruits and especially to those fine pears something happened the process was so swift you were never in time for them its not the flowers that are fleeting its the fruits its the time when things are ready that they dont stay she even went through the rhyme pear tree by the garden gate how much longer must i wait thinking it was the pears that asked it not the picker
4689627 the project is the most sustainable option to secure water supplies from a social environmental engineering and economic perspective
4689628 there is a long history of discussion and negotiations with landowners affected by the proposals which has enabled us to secure the vast majority of the additional land needed by negotiation
4689629 i would question why they essex and suffolk water actually need the land
4689630 if it is to provide a much needed and requested walkway and access to the reservoir then i would be supportive
4689631 but this has been going on for 15 years this isnt something that has just come up out of the blue ninety five per cent of land owners have agreed to it and theres just one or two that have said no

4689654 metrics should not override audit quality and in some instances we may have let metrics compromise performance of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards
4689655 process of issuing guidance on independent audit services that may be provided by dcaa during an ipt
4689656 to recognize this initiative we request that each office hold a stand down day this month in which audit quality is discussed as a group
4689657 the regional director or deputy regional director will participate in these conferences to further emphasize expectations and answer questions or concerns on audit quality
4689658 suffer or be jeopardized by external factors or internal factors e g agency metrics
4689659 it is imperative that all employees cooperate fully with the reviewers
4689660 employees at all levels in the organization should feel free to have open and candid discussion with the evaluators
4689661 audit independence was not impacted by pressures from either the contractor or buying command
4689662 dcaa is one of the few government organizations that holds its employees to high standards day in and day out
4689663 it takes personnel actions against employess that do not perform up to standards i have seen poor performing auditors come and go the poor performing auditors always blame management and complain about the lack of budget hours and due dates that cannot be met it is smoke and mirrors

4689667 it goes to show you that not only is this guy the greatest swimmer of all time and the greatest olympian of all time hes maybe the greatest athlete of all time hes the greatest racer who ever walked the planet
4689668 they examined the video and i think the case is closed the video says phelps finished first
4689669 in my opinion its not right but we must follow the rules everybody saw what happened
4689670 it was very clear that the serbian swimmer touched second after michael phelps
4689671 i dont want to fight this people will be bringing this up for years and saying you won that race if we got to do this again i would win it
4689672 i know i had a long finish and michael phelps had a short finish
4689673 i actually thought when i did take that half stroke i thought i lost the race there but i guess that was the difference in the race
4689674 my last two olympics ive been able to nail my finishes and its been by four one hundredths and one one hundredths
4689675 im happy and kind of at a loss for words
4689676 i saw my short differential between getting a medal or not but then i realized michaels was pretty close too im really glad that he came out on top
4689677 it was everything that an olympic final should be it doesnt matter whos in the heats you just got to get out and race and its anybodys game it was one of the more intense races that ive been in which makes it a great way to end the meet
4689678 i really think the australian team looks great for the relay its going to be a race
4689679 every time you race phelps youll have a great race and a great time just hearing his arms slap on the block gets your heart racing hes amazing im so happy to get the medal

4689721 the people of the world must tell the chinese communist regime in no uncertain terms that not only do we strongly disagree we will not give consent to these atrocities by remaining silent as they happen
4689722 in the run up to the olympics the chinese authorities have locked up put under house arrest and forcibly removed individuals they believe may threaten the image of stability and harmony they want to present to the world

4689963 a lot of the wheat crops are starting to show a lot of fusarium mainly due to the moist conditions we had at flowering
4689964 when you look at the head of the wheat it actually has white areas in it which basically are not going to produce viable seed or good quality seed were seeing it pretty much in every wheat field
4689965 this mimicked estrogen can bind with receptor sites and it can interfere with things like return to estrus if exposure happens while the sow or gilt is pregnant they can have a greater degree of still births so it acts in this negative way by mimicking naturally occurring hormones
4689966 in the last couple of years by the end of june the beginning of july the tap shut off and we werent getting much moisture
4689967 were getting back to where we were getting moisture during the flowering time and filling and were going to be seeing more concerns about fusarium and probably more talk about fusarium resistant varieties
4689968 i think this year is kind of a check year to show us the disease is out there and can cause a bit of damage
4689969 one of the things about fusarium its going to depend on how early it affects the plant a lot of times if it affects the plant early a lot of those seeds wont make it into the sample so the levels found in the sample might be low enough that it wont cause any great discounts
