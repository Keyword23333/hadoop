5360000 we went out and tried to do a bunch of things right at the end of the recruiting and ended up breaking a rule that i didnt even know i broke
5360001 and it created this cloud of are they aboveboard and not only with the public but the coaching fraternity it was a mistake made totally in haste you dont have to hurry you make staff decisions who youre hiring too quickly you make recruiting decisions too early it hurts your program you need to take your time and do it right and dont think everybody is running ahead of you and youre never going to catch up because you will
5360002 theres no question i got caught up in the fame thing you know
5360003 the excitement the allure of being heralded as a wonder boy blah blah blah
5360004 and it was the wrong way to think as i look back the focus in my mind was all about getting the players but the focus should have been doing right by the players and making sure youre deflecting the publicity towards them college football in a way because the names change on the playing field they point to the head coach a lot and if the head coaches arent careful you get caught up in that and i was guilty i was a 33 year old kid that uh that wanted to prove that i belonged wanted to prove that i wasnt going to blink
5360005 on the east coast you know to watch west coast football its a commitment because youre up all night
5360006 watching games until two in the morning and id wake up and its in the third quarter and id go get a cup of coffee and try and finish it but its what i love its just i couldnt not watch
5360007 so im standing right in front of royce hall and powell library and im up on the top of janss steps
5360008 its one of the most beautiful places on campus because you look out and theres bel air to the left and beverly hills behind you and youre looking down on all the athletic facilities and the dorms are in front of you
5360009 and i kinda did that rocky thing at the top
5360010 some poor student behind me is like are you okay sir
5360011 it is what it is im not going to run and hide
5360012 its a problem for everyone else that they cant figure out why we do it that way
5360013 its going to be a hard decision for them but we know theyll make the best decision for the team
5360014 i can get you with power or speed or a mixture of both
5360015 vision is my biggest asset whatever you want i can get it for you
5360016 having so many people just as good as you makes the competition be at a high level and it helps you to work hard every day
5360017 when you dont have that you have a tendency to lay back because you know you have the position here during the time you slack off another guy can step in you always have that in the back of your mind and it kind of helps you as a player
5360018 some of these guys are going to play only special teams or late in blowout games
5360019 as long as we give them opportunities to do what they can do as long as they know theyve got a chance my job is to keep showing them theyve got a chance
5360020 its all about competing its how confident you are and knowing your abilities i know my talents i didnt care what running backs came to usc i just knew i wanted to come here
5360021 ill clean up your layers and give you a better look

5360158 i know that the lord has given you the land and that the fear of you has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you 10 for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea before you when you came out of egypt and what you did to the two kings of the amorites who were beyond the jordan to sihon and og whom you devoted to destruction 11 and as soon as we heard it our hearts melted and there was no spirit left in any man because of you for the lord your god he is god in the heavens above and on the earth beneath 12 now then please swear to me by the lord that as i have dealt kindly with you you also will deal kindly with my fathers house and give me a sure sign 13 that you will save alive my father and mother my brothers and sisters and all who belong to them and deliver our lives from death
5360159 but if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their treachery that they committed against me and also in walking contrary to me 41 so that i walked contrary to them and brought them into the land of their enemies if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled and they make amends for their iniquity 42 then i will remember my covenant with jacob and i will remember my covenant with isaac and my covenant with abraham and i will remember the land 43 but the land shall be abandoned by them and enjoy its sabbaths while it lies desolate without them and they shall make amends for their iniquity because they spurned my rules and their soul abhorred my statutes 44 yet for all that when they are in the land of their enemies i will not spurn them neither will i abhor them so as to destroy them utterly and break my covenant with them for i am the lord their god 45 but i will for their sake remember the covenant with their forefathers whom i brought out of the land of egypt in the sight of the nations that i might be their god i am the lord

5360163 all the days that he separates himself to the lord he shall not go near a dead body
5360164 if the vow is an animal that may be offered as an offering to the lord all of it that he gives to the lord is holy
5360165 when a man dedicates his house as a holy gift to the lord the priest shall value it as either good or bad as the priest values it so it shall stand 15 and if the donor wishes to redeem his house he shall add a fifth to the valuation price and it shall be his
5360166 if a man dedicates to the lord part of the land that is his possession then the valuation shall be in proportion to its seed
5360167 but a firstborn of animals which as a firstborn belongs to the lord no man may dedicate whether ox or sheep it is the lords
5360168 but no devoted thing that a man devotes to the lord of anything that he has whether man or beast or of his inherited field shall be sold or redeemed every devoted thing is most holy to the lord
5360169 every tithe of the land whether of the seed of the land or of the fruit of the trees is the lords it is holy to the lord 31 if a man wishes to redeem some of his tithe he shall add a fifth to it 32 and every tithe of herds and flocks every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsmans staff shall be holy to the lord 33 one shall not differentiate between good or bad neither shall he make a substitute for it and if he does substitute for it then both it and the substitute shall be holy it shall not be redeemed

5360469 we were sick to death of saying no to real when they asked us about ronaldo and real were sick to death of saying no to chelsea when they asked about robinho it struck us that by giving ronaldo to chelsea and robinho coming to us everyone would shut the fuck up

5360517 there is still much for us yet to do we have operating expenses caught up and have made some traction into tomorrow but we will still be working on paying down our debts for the foreseeable future i would be remiss to state that all is well and that we are completely in the clear though we are at least now in a position to address our concerns i am still working to secure the long term future of the bookstore and will be open to investment of any level up to that of a partnership in the business

5360526 companies spend very big bucks on what types of sounds and music activate this behavior its kind of scary in a way were not aware of it its very subconscious
5360527 music doesnt just influence our buying behavior but it also perceives how we view the quality of the service slow pop music and fast classical selections make consumers think the merchandise and quality are better
5360528 the purpose is not to engage you in the song they want the music to activate the parts of the brain that get you to engage in the types of behavior they want

5360544 ekaterina is living in a fantasy world to say she has won ronnie is ridiculous particularly as there isnt a competition
5360545 this silly child is trying to play grown ups but she is just showing how immature and unready she is for an adult relationship
5360546 ronnie is still trying to save his marriage and jo is desperate to see him nursed back to health for her this isnt some playground contest with another woman
5360547 ekaterina will never have what jo and ronnie have together
5360548 i think whats exciting about being a woman and being 40 is that very often you have a kind of confidence that took all those years to get
5360549 but youre still young enough to be excited and to be vital about the future without having to worry about your identity am i a mother
5360550 if you never tell a lie then you never have to remember what you said
5360551 with time batsmen will get used to playing him even murali some seven eight years back was really difficult
5360552 everybody was talking about him with time i think it will get a bit easier mendis is a bit more unusual than murali i have not seen any bowler like this
5360553 mendis is difficult to pick because he is a very different bowler
5360554 but if you see the way he has played the two games against us even in the asia cup he gave away just ten runs in six or eight overs you need to take a few from him and a few from murali and look to attack the others youve got to have something on the board
5360555 we were off to a good start in the asia cup but then we lost quick wickets
5360556 after that when you are playing mendis its difficult it gets a bit tough when you have to rotate the strike and also save the wicket if the bowler is as unusual as mendis
5360557 once you get used to the variations then it gets easy for the batsmen the only option right now is to play more and more of him and thats the only way of getting better you can see a thousand videos but it doesnt matter until you go out there and play him off the track from 20 yards
5360558 definitely they will come back strongly they have a very good side and they have a lot of talented individual players who can change the match for them
5360559 so we will make sure we will play the same brand of cricket that we played today
5360560 virender is a big game player its important for them to have him but we are playing against india and not against individuals thats what we did in the test matches as well he can come and do his job but our task is to make sure it wont happen
5360561 we knew it was going to be tough the indian fast bowlers came strongly and bowled at the good areas when i was batting with kumar sangakkara i said lets bat the 15 20 overs thats crucial unfortunately kumar got out but i thought chamara kapugedera batted really well so we need to keep this momentum going its important that we consistently put partnerships and score runs thats where the difference would be

5360563 suskind writes in his new book that the order to create the letter was written on creamy white house stationery the book suggests that the letter was subsequently created by the cia and delivered to iraq but does not say how

5360569 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5360570 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5360571 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5360830 it wasnt to enable others to get a free fare or cause any sort of havoc
5360831 it was really to show how major the issues are in this system which also might resonate in many other systems around the world
5360832 every day he would drink a half a glass of vodka in the morning and a half in the evening
5360833 one who is faithful in a very little is also faithful in much and one who is dishonest in a very little is also dishonest in much
5360834 no servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other
5360835 every time sin rises to tempt or entice it always seeks to express itself in the extreme every unclean thought or glance would be adultery if it could every covetous desire would be oppression and every unbelieving thought would be atheism it is like the grave that is never satisfied
5360836 in this we see the deceitfulness of sin it gradually prevails to harden mans heart to his ruin sins expression is modest in the beginning but once it has gained a foothold it continues to take further ground and presses on to greater heights this advance of sin keeps the soul from seeing that it is drifting from god the soul becomes indifferent to the seed of sin as it continues to grow this growth has no boundaries but utter denial of god and opposition to him sin precedes higher by degrees it hardens the heart as it advances this enables the deceitfulness of sin to drive the soul deeper and deeper into sin
5360837 you dont have to retrace your steps when you fall back into temptation you simply pick up where you left off
5360838 always be killing sin or it will be killing you
5360839 given that ecommerce is starting to have a better reputation for customer service than stores we were surprised to see that the business challenges driving retailers strategies today focus more on product related issues
5360840 whats not surprising however is that online pure play e tailers are at the forefront of innovation in online shopping
5360841 it appears that the online market is diverging online pure plays are trying to differentiate themselves from multi channel retailers by offering a larger product assortment and a differentiated customer experience in order to battle the cross channel capabilities that they cant offer
5360842 some multi channel retailers have recognized that cross channel offers a real opportunity to provide a high quality customer experience but others appear to be blindly copying e tailer pure plays in an effort to boost their online presence its a real disadvantage if youre primarily a store based retailer to ignore the advantages that cross channel can give you
5360843 president musharraf has made the right decision to step down as president of pakistan it is in the interests of his country and the pakistani people to end the political crisis that has immobilized the coalition government for too long

5361009 the certification office is investigating allegations of financial irregularities and breaches of both the law and solidaritys constitution
5361010 the certification office will issue a ruling on whether the harrington bnp takeover was legitimate
5361011 such calims and and counter claims are not capable of being determined in an administrative manner by this office
5361012 as i have said in previous correspondence trade unions are voluntary organisations that are for the most part left to regulate their own affiars via their rule books
5361013 the final paragraph is a clear enough statement that the certification officer intends to make no judgement or ruling on the legality or otherwise of the harrington takeover and so whatever the outcome of this investigation into the financial affairs of solidarity the fake union will remain in the hands of harrington and the bnp unless the official executive have the wherewithal to take the matter to law
5361014 something we do know for certain is that the executive of official solidarity recently held a meeting to discuss the way forward in the event of the certification office ruling in their favour the meeting concluded that the name of solidarity had been so badly damaged by its close association with the british national party and had attracted so little interest even from bnp members that there was no point in continuing with the operation and they would disband it

5361053 the saddleback civil forum changes the face of american politics pastor rick warren stakes out common ground for the common good in presumptive presidential nominees first joint appearance
5361054 lake forest calif aug 17 presidential hopefuls senators barack obama d ill and john mccain r ariz chose an unprecedented venue and format for their first joint appearance in the campaign for the first time in american history the presumptive nominees had a formal televised conversation with one of the nations leading pastors
5361055 we believe in the separation of church and state but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics
5361056 i dont happen to agree with everything either of the candidates teach or believe but they both care deeply about america theyre both patriots and they have very different views on how our nation can be strengthened
5361057 weve got to learn to disagree without demonizing each other and we need to restore civility in our civil discourse and thats the goal of the saddleback civil forum
5361058 the two hour event attended by nearly 5 000 church members in the main auditorium and remote overflow venues began with warren posing questions first to sen
5361059 of inquiry into four categories including stewardship leadership worldview and americas role in the world the questions covered a wide range of topics ranging from the candidates values vision and virtues as applied to many of the critical issues of interest to the faith community and general public including a discussion on abortion traditional marriage stem cell research education religious persecution world orphans the theory of evil in the world and their vision for the future of america at home and abroad
5361060 when warren asked obama about what christianity means to him on a daily basis the senator responded
5361061 if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not practice the truth
5361062 but what it also means i think is a sense of obligation to embrace not just words but also through deeds and expectations that god has for us
5361063 and that means thinking about the least of these acting justly loving mercy and walking humbly with our god
5361064 in response to that same question about his personal christian faith mccain replied
5361065 i admire the islam theres a lot of good principles in it
5361066 i would like to tell you that i still think that even in the worst places in the world today they still harbor this hope and dream someday to be like us and have freedom and democracy
5361067 we remain my friends the most unusual experiment in history and im privileged to spend every day of my life in it i know what it is like to be without it
5361068 at what point is a baby entitled to human rights
5361069 at the moment of conception i will be a pro life president and this presidency will have pro life policies
5361070 i am pro choice because ultimately i dont think women make these decisions casually
5361071 after both candidates had departed the stage warren concluded the evening by reminding the live television radio and internet audiences that
5361072 i appeal to you brothers to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught avoid them 18 for such persons do not serve our lord christ but their own appetites and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive

5361082 the closer we get to steins the more accurate our knowledge of the asteroids position relative to rosetta will be
5361083 thanks to rosettas cameras we will obtain increasingly precise measurements that will allow us to adjust again if necessary rosettas orbit for an optimal asteroid encounter
5361084 both of rosettas navigation cameras could already see the asteroid from the very beginning of the tracking campaign despite the long distance from steins and contrary to what we expected
5361085 the exceptional quality of the osiris scientific camera namely its angular resolution provided data as accurate as expected and made our current trajectory calculations very precise
5361086 it is the first time ever that we have used optical instrumentation on board a scientific spacecraft for navigation as opposed to the usual techniques based on analysing radio signals
5361087 the exceptional results are really encouraging and we look forward to using this technique again in the future if and when it is possible
5361088 for example it would allow people entering the house to type in a four digit pin code on a pad by the door
5361089 if there was an adult in the house the children would be able to use the oven or microwave but they couldnt if they were home alone similarly it is a way to control or block content on the tv
5361090 we dont believe that we have set the ultimate standard here
5361091 but we believe we have moved the debate ahead by demonstrating that network control systems dont have to be too complicated it is simple for anyone who can use tv text to set up a device and an administrator after connecting a device can decide that it should only be visible or controllable by certain people
5361092 we demonstrated that devices could be automatically recognised by the network to move forward requires the manufacturers of home network enabled devices to agree on a number of standards

5361098 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5361099 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5361100 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5361101 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5361102 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5361103 may i suggest if there are five blokes to every girl we should find out where there are beauty disadvantaged women and ask them to proceed to mount isa
5361104 quite often you will see walking down the street a lass who is not so attractive with a wide smile on her face

5361132 a leader that god has blessed us with at this time
5361133 hardened professionals and their primary strength lies in their being completely unconflicted
5361134 the primary difference is that on the level of criticizing other blogs and bloggers they can actually do some damage
5361135 i was eighteen and i had the advantage of having a car i could go out at night and tell a chick hey you wanna hear a song tomorrow ill dedicate it to you it was magic magic it was the first stage of top forty so personalities were still in play and you had a kinda persona on air and they sent your pictures out the station manager wanted me to have a fan club and all that stuff
5361136 it wasnt just time and temperature and label and artist you could play around any live spots id do them in foreign accents or id do them as characters
5361137 at that time george was fairly conservative i always had a progressive agenda i thought it was the duty of an artist to fight bigotry and intolerance we had long interesting conversations good political discussions
5361138 i kind of learned my politics and liberalism from him
5361139 my mother was part of the joe mccarthy westbrook pegler william randolph hearst francis cardinal spellman axis of conservative catholicism i was probably more centrist but when i watched the army mccarthy hearings i probably rooted for his side i bought all that because i didnt hear a coherent counterargument anywhere
5361140 we ad libbed off each other and talked vaguely about doing a comedy act
5361141 after the radio show i got off at midnight we would improvise a two man act and it was pretty raunchy the cellar was the place where kennedys secret service people spent the night before his assassination where the infamous drinking party took place that the secret service agents were at based on this limited success with this captive audience we drove to california we probably had fifteen minutes we felt secure enough to quit and the guy said oh youll be back others have quit this station and thought they were going to hollywood you guys will be back
5361142 we felt that we should go to hollywood and become a comedy team in nightclubs eight months later we were standing in nbcs building doing the jack paar show as burns and carlin i cant explain those kind of breaks
5361143 jack and i for its time were very topical we took stands we took positions we did jokes about racism about the ku klux klan about the john birch society about religions we had a routine about giving kids heroin kits we felt connected to that sort of movement that was starting then that lenny bruce and mort sahl had been the best exponents of
5361144 well certainly he played the playboy club in 1960 and was on playboys penthouse in that time frame a lot of comics came through chicago in that time frame mort sahl lenny bruce a lot of good friends
5361145 tis the hand of fate that rocks the cradle of liberty
5361146 east is east and west is west and north is north and south is south
5361147 the playboy key club takes great pleasure in presenting a great new comedy team
5361148 we were aiming toward people who were sort of hip
5361149 we wanted to be smart and up to date and like the comedians we admired who were in the new wave we aspired to be blue angel comedians which is where nichols and may played in new york we kept adding material we were fairly fertile we had that safety of two guys up there the first four weeks we spent at the coffee house in hollywood they were fairly nice to you
5361150 lenny bruce was so satisfying to watch i was a young aspiring comedian he helped burns and i what happened was we were at a place called the cosmo alley our first job ever our manager murray becker knew lenny from the navy and i used to do an impression of lenny in the act so he brought lenny in to see the impression but hoping lenny would like the rest of our material lenny called gac the next day that was a big agency in that day like william morris is today the president of gac signed us the next day we got a telegram they want to sign us all fields based on lenny bruces reaction and that started us and that started my own career
5361151 evidently lenny bruce thought we were intelligent there were things george and i would try occasionally that were sharp but we were playing some pretty rough clubs so you couldnt get away with a lot we wanted to do i hadnt gone to college but i was always trying to educate myself in this respect i was always sort of an outsider because who the hell did i hang around with on my corner of the street who read kierkegaard or proust
5361152 unknown to carlin throughout his straight comic period was a prediction made by bruce george carlin would one day assume bruces throne as king of the social comics
5361153 we didnt work very hard and the act wasnt growing
5361154 i think that was mostly my fault i just wanted to sit down and make up new routines and i became a bit of a drawback to him i guess i was subconsciously saving myself for my own act and jack always knew that
5361155 most comedy teams are opposites but george and i were pretty much the same person two irish catholic guys
5361156 about a year after we began the nightclub act i got married i had begun to think more seriously about my future and i knew i was going to be a single before that second year was up i was in dayton jack and i were off he was in boston i was hanging around with my wife in dayton peter paul and mary were scheduled to come in where my wife worked the raquet club where i met her peter had some illness and they couldnt make it and they had two nights open and i was pressed into service i took material of jacks and mine that i was able to do single o and i took some other things i had been preparing for myself and managed to get through two nights of it thats how i knew i was ready
5361157 the blue dog inn in baltimore nobody there i did a show for no one you know something no pressure no pressure it was easy the owner said time for the show eight thirty i said theres no one here he said well in case someone comes in i want them to know we have a show well thats fine for a violinist maybe but a comedian so i ended eight minutes early cause there were no laughs
5361158 i was working at the playboy club in chicago and gate of horn was definitely the chicago folkie scene
5361159 alright alright the show is over cause thats a famous street police thing after a suicide cmon cmon the show is over so he said that and they really wanted to close this club because they brought lenny bruce in so they checked the i d of every person in there probably 300 some people in there and i kept drinking beer they did find a girl who was fifteen and they closed the club eventually i said i dont believe in i d so he took me by the collar and held the back of my belt
5361160 i came out of coffee houses they had a more intellectual bent generally left wing politically and appreciated risk taking in an act of any kind so when jack and i broke up i took over these pre scheduled playboy club dates and did certain nightclub situations and then i hit kind of a dip this is sixty three and sixty four i found a place in new york the cafe au go go on bleeker street i stayed there for like two years on and off just trying to work work work work use it as a laboratory and get my little piece together for merv or mike douglas i hung around the cafe au go go through 1965 sixty three and four and five i did a lot of club dates fifty dollars for the browns hotel in the catskills all these club dates but i stayed around new york and i stayed around that atmosphere and i worked on my act and i was aiming toward television
5361161 the materials orientation toward confrontation and politics which id had a little earlier began to soften and became diluted because i was looking for the mass audience through television in order to further my career
5361162 i did a couple monologues on the kraft summer music hall that they cut they just didnt work i was trying too hard i was digging too deep there wasnt a lot of things there i was an undeveloped writer i was really a club comedian with a limited so i didnt have the depth of experience in my matrix to call on i was writing superficially and it was thin i hated doing these variety shows i got other ones i got the perry como special in hawaii i got jimmy rodgers i did roger millers variety show
5361163 in 1967 i was in the depth of this kind of discontent i was in nightclubs id open for the singer and id do these cute little things and i just knew i wasnt being true to myself other things were turning and churning in me
5361164 sullivan i held out they wanted me on sullivan i told my manager no ive heard that they chew young comedians up there just before you go on they come and they say the roller skating chimpanzees went long so we need you to cut another minute this is a live show youre about to go on in another five or ten minutes i was afraid of that i waited a year or two years finally i went on in 1967 its a very frightening experience i did eleven of them my stomach was just a knot i was just so afraid i knew the audience they were dead they were just dead people yes they laughed at jack e leonard could mow them down with energy the trouble with that audience was first of all they were old fashioned but second of all a lot them in the orchestra seats knew that theyd be turning the lights up later when ed would introduce joe louis or babe ruths widow or somebody from the audience and these people dressed for that these people had their furs and stuff and jewelry so they were a little bit tight little bit tense and here i am trying to do little bit different stuff i did well with established routines but they keep having me back and the money is good you dont walk away from ed sullivan so i was a victim of my own success and i did some ed sullivans i hate i have all eleven of them on a disc and i wont look at them i dont wanna its too hard its too hard to see yourself getting knocked down by a fastball pitcher on those ed sullivan shows i began to realize i didnt fit i was missing who i was
5361165 i think i did that movie in 1966 or 67
5361166 i never really took part in show business id show up but you had to do these variety shows and theyd put you in the bunny number at the end but once i turned the corner i left it
5361167 the hardest years of my life were the three or four years when i was doing straight mainstream bullshit television shows
5361168 i didnt know my head was different i didnt understand that if i thought about it at nine years of age the dream of being on television must still be valid at twenty one but it wasnt that clicked in from the acid thank god for acid
5361169 as america entered the magic decade i was leading a double life my affection for pot continued and my disregard for standard values increased but they lagged behind my need to succeed the playboy club merv griffin ed sullivan and the copacabana were all part of a path i found uncomfortable but necessary during the early 1960s but as the decade churned along and the country changed i did too despite working in establishment settings as a veteran malcontent i found myself hanging out in coffee houses and folk clubs with others who were out of step people who fell somewhere between beatnik and hippie hair got longer clothes got stranger music got better it became more of a strain for me to work for straight audiences i took acid and mescaline my sense of being on the outside intensified i changed
5361170 i began to change in sixty nine seventy thats when i began to experiment with acid i had been a pot smoker most of my life what the acid did was to spring me past the frontier to artificially get me to the next step lsd pushed me over to see that hey im wasting my time with these people i dont really like them im sort of entertaining the enemy theyre kind of a safe play it safe middle class audience and im playing it safe with them and i feel differently inside let me get it out of me
5361171 i believe everything im saying and im happy to be here
5361172 i was straining at the leash i knew i didnt belong in that place
5361173 these places went out of style twenty years ago i see don ameche dance past me one more time im getting the fuck out of here
5361174 toward the end of my act they slowly turned my light off instead of the usual thing where the band plays you off they just brought the light down slowly and they took the sound down at the same time very dramatic it was almost sweet in a way and i knew i was free
5361175 i was doing a lot of auditions for movies and stuff nineteen sixty nine shows up in october nineteen sixty nine at the frontier i closed after one show this was the incident where i said the word ass on stage now there were two separate incidents in this one the golf people these golf assholes they had a golf thing and they all came early and i had to do my show early and they were all drunk i did this thing about my ass i aint got no ass some guys got a bigger ass some guys got a smaller ass guys in the service say hey joe wheres your ass guy aint got no ass for that i was cancelled they paid me off for that job i had a two year contract i was making ten thousand a week i had been there two weeks i had a week to go they closed me after the early show that night that was because of ass
5361176 the following year i came back in august 1970 i was there about three weeks and then that was the night i said shit what i said on that show was yknow some people say shit buddy hackett says shit redd foxx says shit i dont say shit ill smoke a little of it but i wont say it that was everything i said for that i was fired
5361177 the musicians i knew had gone through that transition im listening to bob dylan and i realize these artists are using their talent to project their feelings and ideas not just please people i was in the wrong place in 1967 i was thirty i was entertaining people in nightclubs who were forty they were at war with their kids who were twenty there was a generation war i was in the middle of it i said what the fuck am i doing over here the twenty year olds are the people who will understand me and give me a chance i took two years to change and it happened on television happened on shows like della reese virgina graham and steve allen
5361178 virginia graham was a real shit stirrer she just loved to get me to talk about smoking pot and henry mancini she got henry mancini to cop out to being a pot smoker on tv i went on there my beard was growing my attitudes were changing and i talked about my changes on the panel a lot
5361179 the jimmy dean show in 1963 hosted by the country and western star known best for his phallic mining ballad
5361180 he doesnt want to go back to the uk because hes had so many troubles there already
5361181 he wanted to go to another country like singapore or hong kong
5361182 hes had a very hard time in prison he wont have anything to miss about that place
5361183 he lay on the brown brown pine needled floor of the forest his chin on his folded arms and high overhead the wind blew in the tops of the pine trees the mountainside sloped gently where he lay but below it was steep and he could see the dark of the oiled road winding through the pass there was steam alongside the road and far down the pass he saw the stream and the falling water of the dam white in the summer sun
5361184 i wish to go to where we will hide this explosive until it is time i would like to have it hidden in the utmost security at distance no greater than half an hour from the bridge if that is possible

5361186 our objective is to work together with russia but thats got to be based on russia respecting the independence sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbours and not using its military force to impose its will on those countries
5361187 we are not seeking to freeze or break off the nrc but neither can we have business as usual with russian forces on the ground
5361188 it doesnt make any sense now its like waiting a week for the emergency doctor
5361189 the only means to stabilize the region and bring security to ordinary people
5361190 we support offering a map to georgia as soon as possible
5361191 during the current crisis the government says that until further notice it will not conduct military manoeuvres with russia or visit russian military units

5361215 when you give out six or eight copies drafts of a book you get back six or eight highly subjective opinions about whats good and whats bad in it if all your readers think you did a pretty good job you probably did if everyone who reads your book says you have a problem youve got a problem and you better do something about it
5361216 the great fantasist himself the one big vast huge onions farcical serial failure patrick harrington is attempting to get blogger to do the dirty legal work hes too afraid to do himself hes complained that we used the photograph above from the one big vast huge onions website and therefore breached his copyright
5361217 anyway harringtons a bit on the late side that photo has already appeared on several other internet sites and though we cant be sure we have a feeling its about to appear on many more were not taking it down and were not removing the post as far as were concerned loser harrington can take a running jump off the end of the britannia pier were norfolk unity not clive potter or tim hawke and we bite back

5361226 sometimes im just out there running im getting the ball and seeing the defense and looking to get bad angles or just run over people this year im reading the gaps better its like coach croom said i did leave some yards on the field last year by not reading the gap and seeing wide open holes i made 4 and 5 yards when i could have gotten 10 or 15

5361247 wireless phone companies are waking up to the m2 m market
5361248 they were always blind drunk on profit margins from their traditional voice business but thats maturing now everybody has 1 1 2 phones so wireless carriers are working harder to develop new markets on the data side
5361249 if you think about the possible opportunity its all the houses that are metered in the united states
5361250 utilities are going to use these capabilities to reduce customer demand
5361251 what this means strategically for us is we are no longer looking at 100 penetration in the wireless industry as a ceiling
5361252 when you look at the medical industry theres a big opportunity in monitoring patients outside of hospitals at work or at home with an external device like a bracelet
5361253 were beginning to see some growth in what id call nontraditional resale which is customers that are its primarily machine to machine type usage alarm monitoring meter reading and things of that nature
5361254 we started to see that growth in the last quarter or two
5361255 while thats lowered arpu it tends to be a very good margin business and involves fairly low traffic on the network particularly during peak hours so were encouraged by that

5361261 with modern earth moving equipment and talented construction guys no longer is anybody intimidated by flat sites
5361262 in florida and arizona theyre all flat ive been spoiled with some great sites in my career but im totally bullish on the new southwood
5361263 everybody really liked his perspective on the overall design of the course his philosophy and how to tie this into the site and its history
5361264 im not sure manitoba was ever on the radar screen
5361265 its a mature market and not a growing market but i thought southwood was well organized and financed and they are pretty smart guys there they did a great deal with the university with great people and the right financing we could accomplish good things
5361266 in my view this is totally capable of hosting a canadian open
5361267 but we havent really talked about it because what im doing is building a club for members at southwood
5361268 ask any of us if we prefer to leave here and i believe all of us would say no
5361269 members generally live five to 10 minutes away this is a great location and location is a major consideration
5361270 i think it was admitting we had some problems here really getting all the members to realize that reinvesting here didnt make as much sense as going for something that had a much bigger vision
5361271 once they had all the facts people were able to understand it
5361272 ive been working at it up and down like crazy for seven years out here this year felt pretty good and i was in contention a couple of times and just didnt finish it off for some reason i dont know why i did this week
5361273 you have got your buddies making babies and buying houses and you think what am i doing ive got nothing and im still living with my mom and dad but i guess the dream is powerful
5361274 i have battled those bad thoughts in the past but they werent there as much today
5361275 i try not to think about winning and stuff like that but there was just a feeling that i kind of thought it was going to happen this week
5361276 i cant explain it and guys have tried to explain it to me who knows i dont care if i know or not i won so thats good
5361277 if im going to lose im happy to see adam win it
5361278 he stayed strong and played that backside well all week he got himself a win and good for him im proud of him i really am hes a great guy and he deserved it
5361279 the tee shots today just were not feeling good at all
5361280 but im still right there and i started feeling better late in my round
5361281 as long as the grotto stands key west will never again experience the full brunt of a hurricane
5361282 people are playing in their head considering what happened the last time
5361283 the amount being paid to the industry even though their games are entirely dependent on the content that we own and control is far too small
5361284 if that does not become the case as far as warner music is concerned we will not license to those games
5361285 ecosystems from which people other than the recording industry have derived the majority of value created
5361286 music publishers see music based games as a growth opportunity in an otherwise struggling music business and theyre trying to grab as much of that growth as they can
5361287 we get the content and they get a financial royalty and the promotion and exposure for their bands
5361288 we hope that our partners in the gaming space appreciate not only the value of their own contributions but also those of the recording artists songwriters record labels and music publishers on which their games are significantly based
5361289 major music labels need to reposition themselves as proactive players in developing digital music businesses rather than victims they have a lot of power
5361290 the number of people interested in being associated with the game is probably a thousand times more than we can get into the game
5361291 im finished making sense done pleading ignorance that whole defense
5361292 you drive the car ill f ck him in the back seat

5361296 the return is an important milestone it signifies the confidence the u s government has in liberias recovery and stability
5361297 were all in this together and the people of pakistan and the
5361298 so were confident that while we certainly all have more to do when it comes to fighting terrorism the government of pakistan will continue in the effort
5361299 while this political process is under way we certainly expect theyll keep up their fight against terrorists and extremists and because of what i just said this is a fight that they are in as well
5361300 thats what the prime minister said when he was in washington
5361301 is committed to a strong pakistan that continues its efforts to strengthen democracy and fight terror
5361302 president bush looks forward to working with the government of pakistan on the economic political and security challenges they face
5361303 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5361304 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5361305 i will not continue active customary participation in the ladies in white movement and for that reason i will not be bound to its declarations and pronouncements

5361318 i was worried about someone going down but i ran hard
5361319 in the final im not going to be running for a time ill be running for a gold medal
5361320 but i definitely feel like im in great shape i think im very close to seeing a 48 seconds

5361322 when i looked at the time my whole body it just stopped
5361323 i was jumping up and down because i was so excited
5361324 mentally hes not i dont mean that hes immature he just doesnt know what hes doing i dont think he comprehends the significance of what he just did
5361325 hes pretty much come out of nowhere every time he hits the water he drops like two seconds
5361326 i was talking to coach wade phillips about how its like a turnover we have to stop it
5361327 they tell me the difference between up there the majors and down here is consistency
5361328 i can hit some and i can field some but i want to work on doing everything consistently
5361329 when i had a conversation with him theres not a malicious bone in this guys body hes a huge part of our potential weve got to eradicate that part of the way he plays
5361330 i didnt feel my finger shaking but i guess it was
5361331 i shot a great match its just a crazy thing that happens
5361332 it was one of the greatest things that can happen to a professional athlete
5361333 you start playing this game as a kid and then theyre putting your number up in the rafters
5361334 i have been blessed by such wonderful people in my life
5361335 it was my decision to walk away youre comfortable with it i know i could still play i know my knees would be aching and my back would be aching
5361336 its been a transition year well have a better grip on it next year
5361337 everything was a double to him he ran hard all the time
5361338 they pulled a jones on me andrade said referring to the infamous bogus decision in roy jones jr s championship bout loss to a south korean in the 1988 seoul games
5361339 its been four long years of heartache that weve had to relive over and over
5361340 for us to go home with a silver medal is truly an honor
5361341 there was a lot of boxing and a lot of pushing
5361342 i was worried about someone going down but i ran hard
5361343 in the final im not going to be running for a time ill be running for a gold medal
5361344 but i definitely feel like im in great shape i think im very close to seeing a 48 seconds
5361345 the package with john and colt which last year was something we just dabbled in weve had more time
5361346 when i go in at quarterback im not just coming off the bench
5361347 my arms are loose my legs are loose ive already been playing im sweating different things like that
5361348 i think the fact that hes on the field more now in different packages has helped him as a quarterback because hes getting more confidence and he stays in tune with the game so were excited about his play and seeing him play quarterback some and throw the ball
5361349 im feeling stronger than ever were here to win championships
5361350 we take a lot of pride in that we really do
5361351 when they got up here they were ready to play
5361352 the quality of the team has always followed the activity in the oil fields
5361353 it wasnt hard to keep his interest even when they the panthers werent playing well
5361354 darren played here he knows all the traditions he lived them and played them
5361355 it really is back to the way i remember it
5361356 we hope to get at least two games in this week
5361357 do we expect not to let people score i think thats the mentality we come in with we have three pitchers you go back to their college days they didnt like to allow runs if a run scores we re not going to be happy
5361358 he told me that right after the second inning that i was only going to go three
5361359 i dont mind whatever we have to do to get all of us work
5361360 you can relax its just more fun to see our offense produce that way its not every day you get to see so many home runs and people running the bases
5361361 for sportsmen the olympics are more important i win here for a lot of people not just for me
5361362 nowhere in my best dreams i can imagine something like what i did this year
5361363 i know how difficult it is to win these things and especially here because you only have one chance every four years
5361364 it does mean more for me to win it with serena to share this kind of moment with your sister
5361365 we went to lake casitas two years ago on a training trip
5361366 i bottled a couple bottles of the water from there and brought it all the way over here sprinkled a little bit on everybodys fingers and legs i mean im not superstitious or anything but i think it might have helped

5361370 the best scientific evidence published indicates that among adult women who have an unplanned pregnancy the relative risk of mental health problems is no greater if they have a single elective first trimester abortion or deliver the pregnancy
5361371 instead the apa continues to censor information de legitimize research prohibit opposing points of view obstruct discussions avoid scholarly debates and promote intolerance of those who are negatively impacted by abortion
5361372 no decision has been made about the teams yet but we are very keen to go and be one of the clubs involved in the first afl match played over there
5361373 its a great opportunity there are growing cultural and population ties between india and australia
5361374 the tigers being a revered animal in that country would be a perfect fit for the indian market
5361375 of course when youre training your whole life to get to the olympics you train for gold
5361376 but honestly a silver around my neck three times at the olympics means more to me than anything
5361377 i had a little bit of hope inside me but seeing how beautifully she did her routine i knew
5361378 michael has been arrested for drunk driving do you want to talk to him
5361379 give me a couple of minutes i need to buy a notebook
5361380 its starting to relax but who knows maybe the athletes already brought their own with them
5361381 mike and i were battling back and forth on the bike and were even running alongside each other pushing our bikes uphill at one point we traded leads all the way to the summit and i know what a great runner he is so i went flat out on the downhill i was basically free falling down the side of this mountain
5361382 it was a battle out there and i was glad to catch up to him on the climbs but every time the trail flatted out he took off and was just gone
5361383 it was a good race for me and pretty exciting to duke it out with conrad that doesnt happen very often
5361384 its nice to be at the top of the mountain
5361385 this was a very important race for me as im trying to win my sixth pro series title and after the dnf in richmond i needed the points here ive had quite a few flats this year and flatted at this race the last two years so i made sure to use some extra strong tires brought two cans of air and a couple spare tires i wasnt taking any chances
5361386 to me this is the hardest race of the whole season because of the altitude and the climbing but the ambiance here is really special with all of the community support and great facilities i really enjoy this place
5361387 i probably would have gone a minute slower on that run if it werent for seth he was on my heel the whole time
5361388 coming into this race i thought there were four other guys that could win and they all finished in front of me
5361389 ogden is the best the community is so friendly and its so scenic up here but this course is as physical as they get i mean you even have to pedal the downhills its a really difficult challenge and tests your fitness but at the same time its gorgeous and really fun riding
5361390 i have an overwhelming sense of relief so many things can go wrong out here and when it all works out like this its a great feeling
5361391 i could see her up ahead but i just couldnt catch her

5361393 it transcends the previous limitations of in wall subwoofer designs and ideally complements our sage series planar magnetic loudspeaker systems finally there is a high end subwoofer solution for customers who desire fully integrated speaker systems with no compromise performance

5361398 it came up when i was eight months pregnant when i was beached like a whale

5361418 the governor and his team have not given us the numbers needed for us to start making decisions
5361419 maybe its bigger than any of us have ever assumed maybe the governor is trying to hide what it is
5361420 weve got a situation now where the state of virginias budget is bleeding and the governor is standing there saying oh my weve got to figure out which artery got cut
5361421 floating a number on the back of the envelope really doesnt make much sense

5361544 well i think that whether you are looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity you know is above my pay grade
5361545 but let me just speak more generally about the issue of abortion because this is something obviously the country wrestles with one thing that im absolutely convinced of is there is a moral and ethical content to this issue so i think that anybody who tries to deny the moral difficulties and gravity of the abortion issue i think is not paying attention so that would be point number one

5361549 its the radiocarbon date that to our minds is like a square peg in a round hole its not fitting properly and the question is why
5361550 there is a lot of other evidence that suggests to many that the shroud is older than the radiocarbon dates allow and so further research is certainly needed
5361551 only by doing this will people be able to arrive at a coherent history of the shroud which takes into account and explains all of the available scientific and historical information
5361552 hes had other ideas but theyve all been shot down and this one will be shot down too
5361553 if you love christ why wouldnt you want to explore the possibility that you have an artifact of his material existence on earth

5361556 a lot of the pleasure is in the journey itself
5361557 if we get to the point where we believe we have a viable hypothesis that works in the lab then we have scientific grounds to go to turin and say heres what we think has happened to the shroud

5361810 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because that what theyre putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5361814 we arrived at saddleback and went into a holding room which is a separate building from the main church in the room there were four or five staff people plus mccain and there was no tv no audio no nothing we talked through a few of the topics we had spent time in the afternoon preparing doing q amp a and we did a few more questions to warm him up at about ten til six the advance guys came to get mccain to take him to the stage because the handshake with obama was a few minutes before 6 p m mccain never heard any of this stuff
5361815 you didnt have to be a genius to know that we were going to get asked about life marriage personal faith staffing for faith based organizations a log of things we prepared him for didnt come up but a lot of them we anticipated
5361816 we had him prepared and in any given situation mccain is going to use his own instincts and give his own answers it was like a town hall meeting and rick warren was the only person in the meeting
5361817 im sorry the obama campaign is whining about having a bad night

5361843 we knew we could vastly improve the customer experience by deploying an online booking application to enhance our existing web site ibm came in and really pulled the project together in an amazingly short period of time five months compressing a development cycle that was slated to take 12 months
5361844 when customers book a tour the application is simultaneously booking reservations for hotels buses and so on
5361845 we needed our online system to extend the complexities built into our core business systems out to the web without making the process too complicated for our customers the websphere commerce solution did this without having to completely rewrite our back end systems
5361846 this project is a great example of how ibm is helping clients adapt to constantly changing conditions such as rising fuel costs and new terms of engagement between airlines and travel agencies
5361847 using ibm software and soa companies like vantage can make it easier and less expensive for consumers to book vacations while reducing the time and money it takes to manage a complex business and web site like this

5361866 with this blog were opening up a two way discussion about how we are making windows 7 we strongly believe that success for windows 7 includes an open honest and two way discussion about how we balance all of these interests and deliver software on the scale of windows we promise and will deliver such a dialog with this blog
5361867 one of our chief goals with this release is to be deliberative thoughtful and considerate with what we disclose
5361868 when we disclose information we want to make sure it is accurate and truthful steven and jon would like to start the conversation about windows 7 and they will continue to provide information at various milestones in the development process
5361869 this reflects the fact they are hoping to get window 7 out by 2010 and there will be some things in it of interest to software developers to get those developers they need to start corralling them now this is sort of a starting gun for that push
5361870 there were vista blogs before vista shipped theres an ie8 blog and blogs are a standard way of communicating with developers and others
5361871 if microsoft really wants to open a dialog in time to get any real feedback they cannot wait much longer in the dev cycle plus they need to have enough information out so that developers can support windows 7 as soon as possible once its released
5361872 not to set expectations around the release that end up disappointing you features that dont make it claims that dont stick or support we dont provide
5361873 it would be a good thing for him to do for windows 7 what he did with office they will benefit from a fairly conservative release delivered on time windows 7 could come out onto the market with less of the early pain vista had to face

5362139 within the last year over a million americans have lost their homes to foreclosure with potentially millions more to come and yet mccain who has collected ten houses to himself finds it appropriate to lecture the public about cutting their vacations short and picking up second jobs

5362174 senator durbin owes not only the senate an apology i dont know if censure would be in order but an apology because it does a great disservice to men and women who suffered in the gulag and in pol pots killing fields dick durbin should be required to read aleksandr solzhenitsyns gulag archipelago and i think that he may have a better understanding that theres no comparison whatsoever and it does a great disservice to the majority of men and women who are serving in guantanamo who are doing the job that theyre told to do and theyre doing it in a humane fashion to tar the american servicemen and women with a brush that applies to the gulag or the killing fields is a great disservice to the men and women in the military who are serving honorably down there

5362229 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5362230 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5362231 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5362232 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5362233 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5362234 you cant always change things sometimes you dont have no control over the way things go hail ruins the crops fire burns you out and then youre just given so much to work with in a life and you have to do the best you can with what you got thats what piecing is the materials is passed on to you or is all you can afford to buy thats just whats given to you your fate but the way you put them together is your business

5362253 i am very proud of our young students who continue to show that filipinos can also be excellent in math like their counterparts in other countries
5362254 they have sacrificed a lot to train their parents also spent hard earned money and also gave much of their time and support for the training to make it possible for their children to participate in these tournaments that has given honor recognition and goodwill to our country
5362255 the peace talks would not stop government forces both the military and the police from pursuing and going after these rebel leaders who have turned into criminals
5362256 these criminals have to be dealt with accordingly they have to be brought to the bar of justice
5362257 it is a very fluid and a very volatile situation
5362258 we have to hold hands as we are together in this endeavor this is a call for sobriety and objectivity for us to analyze the situation and give the proper reaction
5362259 it is time to heal and we must isolate the criminals those who do not want to heal
5362260 all that the president has to do is to come out on national television and say that i have already done my best that a peace agreement be reached but these people do not want peace i am instructing the armed forces to go after them
5362261 we want government not only to react but also deal with a situation by preventing it from happening

5362263 unlawfully acquired by the spouses gimenez in conspiracy with olanday
5362264 since the constitution clearly says that it is the supreme court sitting en banc that shall decide on all election cases involving the president or the vice president the creation of the pet is a misnomer otherwise we would have the anomaly of a decision of the pet rendered by the members of the sc exercising quasi judicial function being asked to be reviewed by the same members of the sc this time exercising its strictly judicial power
5362265 the constitution provides that the supreme court cannot exercise quasi judicial function or functions of administrative bodies exercising discretion of a judicial nature and that no member of the supreme court shall be designated in any agency performing quasi judicial or administrative function article viii section 12
5362266 furthermore the pet being a quasi judicial body the chief justice of the supreme court is merely addressed as mr chairman and the associate justices as mere mr member of the tribunal which practically diminishes their title and position
5362267 the close to p70 million budget for set and the p85 million budget for the hret would be considerably reduced if their entire 18 man membership is just reduced to a seven man cet aside from getting assurance that they would be independent and non partisan and will discharge their functions with complete detachment impartiality and independence
5362268 furthermore the congressmen could concentrate on their jobs as lawmakers while the justices could focus their work on purely judicial matters for after all the constitution clearly prohibits them from being designated to any agency performing quasi judicial or administrative functions
5362269 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure

5362271 the airport is a place of joy for travelers and a welcome beacon for those coming home
5362272 we will be happy to see new heroes who labored abroad and come back once more to their true home
5362273 i do not agree with that reasoning because the meaning of the event the martyrdom of the late senator aquino is diluted by transferring the actual celebration of the event to another date
5362274 i think the president is playing up to the crowd by saying we have an additional holiday but the net effect is the transfer destroys the meaning and solemnity of the occasion
5362275 people should be reminded of an event that took place on a particular day and celebrate it accordingly even at some sacrifice

5362324 the idea that humans on an almost daily basis have to prove their very humanity via a test administered by a computer strikes me as both amusing and indicative of the information overload of our times whats even more absurd is that captcha codes get cracked all the time meaning that scientists have to constantly develop new tests for humans to prove their humanity

5362344 one of the great things to come out of these olympic games is that the tremendous use of our digital properties online and the great viewership online and the tremendous number of page views is really teaching us a tremendous amount about what people want to consume great content and so were going to come out of these olympics with great digital knowledge and hopefully well be able to turn those digital pennies into digital if not dollars digital 50 cent pieces at some point
5362345 the draft of the moa ad with initials is not the current draft the current draft document is the one submitted to senate and the house by presidential adviser on the peace process hermogenes esperon
5362346 the use of the terms of reference that would imply that we will be setting up a new state is the difference between the initialed moa and new one
5362347 unlike the previously initialed moa the new one explicitly states that the agreement should be within legal and constitutional processes
5362348 that means the agreement cannot go beyond what are stated in these laws
5362349 thus fears of dismembering the republic or giving up the countrys territory in mindanao to the milf are unfounded
5362350 in one case the supreme court held that ripeness and prematurity are correlated matters
5362351 for a case to be considered ripe for adjudication it is a prerequisite that something had by then been accomplished or performed by either branch before a court may come into the picture
5362352 only then may the courts pass on the validity of what was done if and when the latter is challenged in an appropriate legal proceeding
5362353 on the other hand prematurity deals with the question of whether all remedies have been exhausted before resort to the courts could be had
5362354 clearly nothing has yet been accomplished or performed by all the concerned parties who were supposed to give their imprimatur to the said proposed agreement
5362355 it is not yet a perfected agreement only a proposal to pave the way for the resumption of formal peace talks between the government and the milf
5362356 this is the amazingly disgusting and depressing reality of the incarnate self contradiction of malaca ang viz while promising peace and harmony in mindanao it is instead reaping the downright killing and wounding of people their big displacement and impoverishment
5362357 if such is still possible under the ruling administration how many more lives have to be killed how many more families have to be impoverished how many more barangays especially in mindanao have to be made no mans land how many more only for malaca ang to hold on to power
5362358 but as of this afternoon some 150 tribal chieftains leaders elders and even members of the tribal warriors and ordinary tribes with families have started to arrive already we are not expecting this kind of enthusiasm we are getting
5362359 if karen would continue to move west it might make landfall over northeastern luzon
5362360 we are extending the revenue hours instead of the 9 30 last trip were having an 11 p m last trip from monumento to baclaran same is true at line 2 with the last trip at the recto station to santolan station at 11 oclock
5362361 this will be from monday to friday except holidays we will be starting tomorrow
5362362 this is as per directive of the president to help commuters who go home late to provide them a faster safer and cheaper ride home
5362363 these requests have probably reached president arroyo herself thats why she gave us direct instructions to immediately extend our operating hours
5362364 we would like to tell people to avail of this they now have an alternative mode of transport especially those who go home late at night
5362365 even if our ridership for all line systems will increase by 50 percent we can still absorb the additional passengers
5362366 remember we now have an increase in ridership that is very encouraging
5362367 well see if theres an increase well also do it on weekends
5362368 when i was doing the research for this report i asked sites how hard their traffic had been hit by the introduction of in stream ads
5362369 the answer was very little usually they reported flat growth for a month or two or a few percent down before normal growth continued
5362370 half the people that leave because of the ad would have left because of the content anyway its like flicking through channels on tv
5362371 it makes sense that in stream ads are more popular because everyone has broadband now and we expect to see richer content on the web
5362372 its also a return to allowing people to sit back again people can relax and be entertained which might be refreshing in this cluttered call to action environment
5362373 they give online publishers access to a revenue stream that many are still missing out on
5362374 they are frightened to accept ads because consumers always say they dont like them and youtube terrifies them by saying that ads lose them the vast majority of traffic
5362375 we have to be careful because these 16 players in both men and womens division have prepared for this event
5362376 if you win in the first round you have a 50 percent chance of winning a medal
5362377 if their performance is up to the level we have a good fight if they win in the first round they will be more composed to fight in the next rounds all the way to final
5362378 the draw of tshomlee very good the draw for toni not bad
5362379 on fight day some will be strong depends on the mindset but his korean training very good now he can win gold

5362427 es rgert mich nat rlich sehr dass uns mein fehler die chance auf eine bessere platzierung zunichte gemacht hat das team hat am gesamten wochenende hervorragende arbeit geleistet und unser swift super 1600 lief problemlos wir haben alle wertungspr fungen absolviert und das ziel erreicht das hatte oberste priorit t leider war letztendlich trotz unserer guten aufholjagd nicht mehr drin als platz acht

5362434 having two centers of power in the country is a major challenge because on one hand mugabe would not accept playing a second role to tsvangirai while on the other hand morgan cannot be second to mugabe

5362437 an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by constructing a specially crafted web page when a user views the web page the vulnerability could allow remote code execution an attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the logged on user
5362438 the snapshot viewer issue impacts any internet explorer 7 users that have the activex control installed and any internet explorer 6 users regardless if they have the control installed or not the nature of the control allows the attacker to install it and exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction
5362439 we think bringing security vendors in the loop regarding pending security patches and potential vulnerabilities is a positive move toward expediting and enhancing user protection
5362440 early notification of all potential mitigations for disclosed vulnerabilities especially those critical in nature can only help to better protect enterprise and consumer computer users globally in addition to clear and timely notification of risk levels via alert services such as deepsight we can typically augment vendor patches by early and timely deployment of protection content to these users via antivirus firewall policy enforcement and intrusion prevention during the critical period between the patch being made available and getting deployed to the end user systems

5362465 the legislature is on the verge of having the government decide whom businesses and consumers can buy their energy from and of letting bureaucrats determine what prices for energy should be
5362466 it is competition that drives prices down not government guaranteed monopolies
5362467 the unintended consequence will be higher energy costs and rising unemployment

5362593 gripping michael yorks narration and voices in dialect are top drawer artistry and bring the drama and environment and the ambience of the victorian era into such a realm that one is completely absorbed transported back to that time to live the experiences of the characters john bell youngs playing is sensitive and powerful i have found it one of the most moving audio experiences ive encountered the production is a gem
5362594 a passionate performance york throws himself into tennysons melodrama and his expertise with english accents deftly differentiates between the working class enoch and the bourgeois miller who marries his wife young brings a great sense of conviction to the 66 minute performance first class packaging too
5362595 a stunning new recording very different from any enoch ive ever heard a subtle and inward performance a heck of a fine pianist a bargain for a performance of this quality for a work of this stature a terrific recording
5362596 it is clear from the detail included in this production that it was a labor of love pianist john bell young was eager to record both the poem and the music richard strauss wrote specifically for it he brought british actor michael york on board and the two wrote essays for liner notes that nearly amount to a book the entire poem is also included as well as biographies of all involved and the history of the poem if you are not acquainted with the story with its contradictions and bitter ironies then this passionate and quite beautiful production makes for the perfect introduction york displays the crisp diction and precise pacing that keep him frequently employed as an audio book narrator he approaches the material with the appropriate degree of warmth and vigor but does so with great finesse matching the spirit of the material without overstating the obvious strausss music as presented by young is vital and undeniably dramatic
5362597 here is one of the more peculiar rarities in the strauss corpus a sprawling accompaniment to alfred lord tennysons melodrama about a young man presumably lost at sea who returns home many years later to find his wife remarried to his childhood friend remarkably two labels are competing with new recordings of enoch arden at the same time each with differing approaches yorks intimate conversational telling of the tale works far better on a recording and youngs playing is freer in manner
5362598 enoch arden is seldom performed and the few recordings include one by pianists glenn gould and claude rains as narrator english actor michael york and american pianist john bell young have just recorded it in an expressive rendition that matches the dynamic contours of the music york conveys an array of vocal colors with clarity and dramatic energy young captures the changing moods with rhythmic momentum and subtle changes as the text progresses the chemistry between york and young can be heard in the pensive opening measures and it continues throughout the piano intensity is beautifully balanced with the narrative the charisma attention to detail and intimacy of this disk make it something to share with friends

5362631 the legislature doesnt like that but when we force them to read the code then they agree
5362632 the trouble is that some legislators will tell us to set the guidelines in administrative rules but the same legislators will turn around and essentially tell us we dont have the authority to write those rules
5362633 if lawmakers would have provided criteria for denying waiver requests we would do so but as the law is written we dont have the authority to deny any waiver requests
5362634 as far as im concerned i tend to be neutral on the issue because it doesnt make a difference to me when schools begin and end as long as they are fulfilling the time obligations
5362635 it is a local control issue not a state issue
5362636 there are a number of factors that dictate our calendar here theres one that involves graduation and where to find a venue big enough to hold graduation the only venue large enough to hold graduation that would seat everyones family is carver hawkeye arena there are limited dates we can use carver and memorial day weekend happens to be one of those dates
5362637 our negotiated contract with teachers also stipulates a number of days appropriated for winter and spring break so we have to comply with this as well
5362638 we try to end the year in may but invariably we have to add snow dates so we have to allow for these days as well
5362639 if you go into the second week of june you begin interfering with swim lessons sports camps and teachers taking classes for professional development credits
5362640 districts have so many hours for instruction to kids between july 1 and june 30 and they can figure it out how they will fulfill their time obligations
5362641 that would allow districts more flexibility to develop a schedule that is best for their community they could go to four day school weeks year round schooling or change the vacation formulas this would assure more consistency regarding the amount of education students are getting
5362642 about two thirds of the school buildings in iowa are now air conditioned so the heat is not as big an issue any more
5362643 on the other hand from a taxpayers perspective is starting school in august the best use of taxpayers money if they are being dismissed early
5362644 this is a valid argument kids just dont learn well in this type of environment
5362645 i wish it wasnt but it is something to consider
5362646 something like 56 or 57 percent of our school buildings are air conditioned so we have to take this into account on extremely hot days

5362707 but to walk away with two medals so far im absolutely ecstatic
5362708 on any given day weve got six riders who are world class
5362709 were like a family there are no egos and its very level and everyone gets on great so its fantastic
5362710 we wouldnt have this medal around our necks if it wasnt for them as well
5362711 both those guys are great friends westley gough is one of my best mates hell be on the top dais with us many times im sure and so will pete pete came into the team late because he had a serious injury last year breaking his back
5362712 those guys are so young they dont even realise what theyre doing right now its quite phenomenal really to be riding 3 57 and one of the guys is 20

5362720 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5362721 musharraf made the critical choice to join the fight against al qaida the taliban and other extremist groups that threaten the peace and security of pakistan its neighbors and partners throughout the world for this he has our deep gratitude
5362722 one of the worlds most committed partners in the war against terrorism and extremism
5362723 the war against extremism is bigger than any one person whats important here is that we work with pakistan to do what we can to root out these extremists
5362724 were properly addressed by relevant authorities or departments through consultations
5362725 the clock is ticking for the chinese government to demonstrate its good faith regarding these so called protest zones
5362726 we think that you do not really understand chinas reality china has its own version and way of exercising our democracy
5362727 justifiable concerns about the whereabouts and safety of those individuals
5362728 china is presenting itself as a place with democratic freedoms where everyone has the right to protest even during the olympics but in reality the protest permits wont be granted
5362729 i have lived all over since i became homeless including tunnels warehouses on the street and the houses of friends and relatives
5362730 what they have done to us is unlawful and unfair
5362731 i have always believed in my government even though i have lost everything my possessions my home and my job were taken away from me i dont feel like a citizen anymore
5362732 it was going to hit us or could have gone on to the housing estate
5362733 but i think the pilot must have realised what was going to happen because the plane then banked very very sharply like they do in those acrobatic displays
5362734 he saved an awful lot of lives he deserves a medal it could have been absolutely disastrous
5362735 the cessna pilot was a very close friend of mine and he was one of those guys whom we saw around the airfield and admired
5362736 he got to be a professional pilot the hard way always a smile and always a worker above all a great friend
5362737 i was going to describe how much of a top guy he was but words are just failing me aviation has lost a great friend
5362738 he was an excellent young man who really did work his way up from nothing to what he considered to be the dream flying job
5362739 only a few days ago he was in the bar telling us what a great job he had got he will be missed
5362740 they have found one wing and the tail and they are hoping to find more as they go
5362741 the defendants role was to police the website which gave him the opportunity to transfer these images to his computer

5362746 my 1st makeup trial a success thank god that was easy
5362747 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5362748 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5362749 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5362750 these traffic segments were penalised by the economiccontext observed in europe and by the strong rail competition onthe domestic market
5362751 i was really excited when i heard about it and the fact that they are openly out there they look so happy together
5362752 i was having a hard time at school in terms of being crap at everything
5362753 the smartest most sophisticated person i think i have ever met
5362754 all of the consumers i have ever talked to have stressed the shortage of beds
5362755 there are more ways than one of supporting people through a crisis an acute ward isnt necessarily the best place to be the best therapeutic environment
5362756 the practice of sleepovers is very disruptive to patient equanimity they often feel dispossessed during the daytime lacking a bed home base and uncertain as to their next moves it can make them feel like pawns in somebody elses game
5362757 i would like to see us having made major inroads into even the big recommendations over a six to eight month period
5362758 but about a decade ago we realized we needed to create new products so we began thinking about how to create habits for products that had never existed before

5362763 buenos d as bebe precioso te amo mucho como amaneciste hoy papi estas comodo
5362764 in my 19 years in this business i have never seen anything like this
5362765 i have seen many buyers come in with a lot of cash money but never this much money in coins
5362766 he had dimes quarters half dollars silver and susan b anthony dollars it took me an hour and a half to count all of it
5362767 paper money will burn but it is hard to damage coins i bought four or five rolls of coins each month i dont know how long it took me to save this amount probably all my life spending some of it now in then
5362768 he gave me lunch money in coins and each time he ever gave me money it was in coins
5362769 i am amazed that we were able to talk him into buying a new truck because he is pretty tight with his money
5362770 he still wanted to fix up the old truck and keep driving it but i convinced him to give it up
5362771 he is in pretty good health now except he rambles a little when he talks
5362772 what is it its the new camaro thats what it is
5362773 the new camaro well it accelerates like its being chased by the hounds of hell hey i can relate but enough about my love life
5362774 its a whole new kind of car for a whole new kind of people who really dig driving
5362775 its not how young you are its how old you arent
5362776 while the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5362777 no that is not the case the 1970 camaro is in fact the first of the second generation camaros there might be some parts interchangeability with the 69 camaro but a 1970 camaro has more in common with a 1981 camaro or a 1976 nova platform wise than it does with a 1969 camaro
5362778 the car shared a platform and many components with the 1969 camaro
5362779 your point seems to be that they are basically the same car and then you try to explain it away by saying that you meant that they were both f body cars
5362780 generally i was very happy with the tests but i wouldve liked to have gone just a second quicker we worked in many different areas and all three riders gave us a lot of valuable feedback so im not complaining we didnt do much work with the electronics yet because we feel we have to start by making sure weve a good bike before working on the electronics the basics have to be right but we are heartened already because the bike has enough horsepower and good torque our goal is to make sure that the horsepower is usable power and the bike is good to ride but all the signs are that we are going in the right direction
5362781 the base is good and the bike feels strong and what we need now is more and more laps and more and more testing but i can tell you that the basics of a superbike are already in the pitbox right now
5362782 when i was first approached by bmw i was interested in the project straightaway

5362787 once there was another city here and now it is gone there are almost no traces of it anymore but millions of us know it existed because we lived in it the lost city of new york
5362788 as theyre called prefer to stand in the middle of the road on the concrete medians at intersections
5362789 the 50 50 calls go the way of the team thats creating the momentum
5362790 the tackles we were making were putting them behind the advantage line so we were going forward when you get a situation like that the calls tend to favour the guys going forward thats where we perhaps got a couple of calls
5362791 we very much regret the inconvenience to our patients and staff but we are still very concerned at the number of staff and patients that have become ill during the past 24 hours
5362792 theres pressure on the hospital but we are managing the best we can
5362793 we will remove the restrictions as soon as the situation is under control
5362794 we do watch closely because norovirus exists out in the community for large parts of the year
5362795 when it comes into a hospital it causes problems because our patients are poorly and are often sitting ducks for that sort of infection if we dont put in place good measures
5362796 it should be the same for people at home if their family is affected
5362797 if you had someone with symptoms in your house i would concentrate on really thorough cleaning of touch points in your bathroom handles toilet flush taps and probably some bleach in the toilet area would be a good idea as would keeping them away from the kitchen area

5362803 fleeting human creation a spontaneous uncontrolled collaboration and we shouldnt expect it ever to be perfect or even to be very good
5362804 human life is theology virtually everything we do is inherently theological almost every choice we make reflects what we think about god theres no escaping it
5362805 if one changes the methods one will inevitably change the message p 96
5362806 look this is how i see it and why how do you see you see it and why
5362807 well for the christian it is but not for the hindu
5362808 but of course i sometimes wonder if ive been duped i sometimes wonder if this story can really be true after all
5362809 well as i understand it homosexual unions are at cross purposes with gods ultimate intentions for human sexuality and so theyre morally wrong but i also recognize that war is at cross purposes with gods ultimately good intentions for human relations and so too divorce now why are we willing to say when it comes to war and divorce which we believe to be at cross purposes with gods ultimately good intentions for the world that it is sometimes morally permissible to engage in these activities and why arent we willing to say that about homosexual unions
5362810 and how to fit our 21st century lives into the biblical narrative

5362816 as of june nominal home prices declined 10 7 percent from a year ago given our home price expectations for the remainder of this year we expect 2 7 million preforeclosure and foreclosure filings in 2008 up nearly 50 percent from 2007
5362817 nominal home price declines have stabilized in the 10 to 11 percent range for several months however given the surge in inflation real inflation adjusted home prices are still declining at a faster rate between april and june home price declines were flat falling by an average of 10 8 percent but real home price declines accelerated from 15 3 percent in april to 16 8 percent in june
5362818 thirty seven states are experiencing nominal price declines which is the same as last month california and nevada are clearly experiencing the largest drops declining at more than 20 percent arizona and florida decreased more than 17 percent from a year ago several new england and midwestern states have declined between 9 and 13 percent during the last year
5362819 although nominal prices have moderated overall the moderation is occurring for a few select states with the exception of florida the top five and bottom five states in terms of price appreciation continue to experience larger declines and smaller increases relative to the last few months the more interesting price trends are occurring in the middle of the appreciation distribution where several formerly moderately depreciating states such as new york colorado louisiana and the district of columbia are experiencing fairly slower albeit still negative declines

5362821 this is my first time doing something like this i am fortunate to speak to the fans and let them know what we go through each day
5362822 it is very important for the fans to know what experiences the players go through on a daily basis because people get the misconception that this job is a breeze
5362823 fans come and go but when it comes to the die hard redskins fans there is no question they are the best fans that i enjoy playing for i told marcus washington that you havent really played football until you have played at fedex field its louder than anything i have played before when i played for the 49ers it was loud however the redskins fans are triple that its a blessing to be here

5362924 i think its arguably dangerous in the sense that by assuming that russia may be more aggressive than it is and by pushing russias back up against the wall its possible that one can produce a self fulfilling prophecy
5362925 it was right around this time four years ago that the dishonest and highly effective swift boat attacks on john kerry began now the man who started it all with a book about kerry has one out attacking obama can the swift boaters repeat their success or does obama know how to fight back

5362945 mccains stance on russia has been consistent and it has brought many admirers to his side other americans who also believe that the russian bear is best kept on a short leash
5362946 if blair were to go wobbly if he were to begin to say its time for us to begin to head for the exits that would certainly increase the pressure on bush to follow suit

5362955 this is the worst president ever he george w bush is the worst president in all of american history
5362956 theres really a sense that shes a hero for asking those tough questions
5362957 such a huge responsibility that she takes so so seriously and as seriously now as when she first walked in the white house almost 50 years ago

5363023 south of 20 crowd had a personal interest in ending the vietnam war they were subject to the draft which students today arent so it was life or death 60s students were fighting for not some soaring abstract ideal
5363024 south of 20 apathy today is that they have no stake in the american dream they have no children they dont own houses or investments they dont make much if any money so they dont care about taxes

5363028 any time you win you always put yourself on the map to have guys who are successful in the game look at your team

5363033 its focusing on within not from without when you start focusing outside you lose sight on what you need to think about working on and expend your energy the wrong way if you play the game hard everything else will take care of itself
5363034 we go out there and play the same way every day whether its the royals yankees as whatever
5363035 thats the way we go about our business thats one of the keys to our success for sure
5363036 its what were doing that matters were going to scoreboard watch and im o k with that i want us to take care of our effort and our mental preparation each night and im good with what happens

5363043 fuimos nosotros quienes impedimos que nuestro gas pase a manos extranjeras en octubre de 2003 y en esa entonces ni dirigentes chapacos mi del oriente se pronunciaron por la defensa de los hidrocarburos es m s catalogaron la lucha alte a como una lucha de ignorantes de intransigentes que perjudic bamos el desarrollo del pa s

5363066 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5363067 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5363068 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking

5363070 the continuation of the awakening councils as they are now is unacceptable
5363071 we fought the americans for four years and we fought al qaida too

5363078 the younger kids are focusing more on their planning and problem solving while they are actually playing the game while adolescents are focusing less on their planning and strategizing and more on the here and now
5363079 the single best predictor of their skills is how much they had played video games in the past and how much they played now those were better predictors of surgical skills than years of training and number of surgeries performed

5363093 the resignation of president pervez musharraf is a step toward moving pakistan onto a more stable political footing
5363094 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5363095 the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally
5363096 it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face
5363097 we might roll down the shutters we got built in generators

5363100 we dont want people to focus on the exact track this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the centre makes landfall

5363107 doesnt want to talk about just abortion and gay marriage but also poverty and disease
5363108 thats because rick warren says many younger evangelicals define social issues broadly to include global warming human rights poverty not just abortion
5363109 democrat barack obama has had about a 3 to 1 advantage over republican john mccain in post page 1 stories since obama became his partys presumptive nominee june 4 obama has generated a lot of news by being the first african american nominee and he is less well known than mccain and therefore theres more to report on but the disparity is so wide that it doesnt look good
5363110 when you listen to this john mccain ad it might sound like barack obama has a messiah complex
5363111 t he mccain campaign says its all in good fun not everyones laughing some democrats say the ad which appears only on the internet is infused with hidden messages to evangelical christians messages that barack obama isnt the messiah at all
5363112 democrats were quick to portray the ticket as quote two texas oilmen because cheney was chief of a big dallas based oil supply conglomerate they also blast cheneys voting record in congress as again quote outside the american mainstream because of cheneys votes against the equal rights for women amendment
5363113 in their first joint appearance they gave a preview of the gore lieberman fight back come back strategy their message they represent the future not the past and they are the ticket of high moral standards most in tune with real mainstream america
5363114 didnt president saakashvili of georgia bring some of this on himself by going into south ossetia
5363115 how do you respond to the argument that by pushing for georgia to be in nato by pushing for ukraine to be in nato by putting a missile defense system in czechoslovakia this was seen as belligerent and aggressive by putin and kind of brought him in
5363116 warrens attempt to redefine evangelicals by breaking with the politics of the past
5363117 doesnt want to talk about just abortion and gay marriage but also poverty and disease
5363118 thats because rick warren says many younger evangelicals define social issues broadly to include global warming human rights poverty not just abortion
5363119 i call myself whole life which means i dont just believe in that little girl before shes born but i believe that its important to care about after shes born whether shes poor whether shes educated
5363120 hes invited anti abortion senator bob casey to speak in denver bill clinton kept caseys father then pennsylvania governor from speaking at the 1992 convention for his anti abortion views
5363121 but false rumors obamas a muslim his controversial former pastor and his liberal views on abortion and other issues complicate obamas efforts to win over evangelical voters
5363122 obama on vacation yet earns more and better coverage than mccain
5363123 weekday 2 no media benefit for mccain from obamas vacation
5363124 one of the great leaders and he happens to be pro choice and i dont think that would necessarily rule tom ridge out
5363125 democrat barack obama has had about a 3 to 1 advantage over republican john mccain in post page 1 stories since obama became his partys presumptive nominee june 4 obama has generated a lot of news by being the first african american nominee and he is less well known than mccain and therefore theres more to report on but the disparity is so wide that it doesnt look good
5363126 in overall political stories from june 4 to friday obama dominated by 142 to 96 obama has been featured in 35 stories on page 1 mccain has been featured in 13 with three page 1 references with photos to stories on inside pages
5363127 dovetails with obamas dominance in photos which i pointed out two weeks ago at that time it was 122 for obama and 78 for mccain
5363128 when obama traveled to the middle east and europe the coverage dwarfed that of mccain six page 1 stories from july 19 to july 27 plus an earlier front page story announcing the trip mccain managed one page 1 story and one page 1 reference the july 25 story said he might pick a vice presidential candidate soon but that didnt happen
5363129 when you listen to this john mccain ad it might sound like barack obama has a messiah complex
5363130 t he mccain campaign says its all in good fun not everyones laughing some democrats say the ad which appears only on the internet is infused with hidden messages to evangelical christians messages that barack obama isnt the messiah at all
5363131 going back to the classic republican playbook of playing to these peoples fears trying to you know send a message to these folks that you really need to be careful you really need to worry about this guy he literally could be a cosmic anti christ figure and for a lot of people that may sound strange to believe but there is a significant part of the community that will take this stuff very seriously
5363132 argues the mccain ad borrows ideas and visual imagery from the blockbuster left behind series the books weave a tale of a modern day anti christ a young political leader who rises to power with a message of peace and unity and leads a world religion that proclaims we are god
5363133 bias doesnt get much more obvious or easy to see than this
5363134 didnt president saakashvili of georgia bring some of this on himself by going into south ossetia
5363135 how do you respond to the argument that by pushing for georgia to be in nato by pushing for ukraine to be in nato by putting a missile defense system in czechoslovakia this was seen as belligerent and aggressive by putin and kind of brought him in
5363136 governor romney senator mccain said this week we are all georgians now but didnt president saakashvili of georgia bring some of this on himself by going into south ossetia
5363137 becoming a democracy and standing up for the principles of freedom
5363138 well certainly when his truckload of policemen is attacked by south ossetians and blown up you have a responsibility as a government to protect citizens as he had communities being attacked with rockets that were coming from south ossetia and so he of course took action to protect his nation the russians have been looking for an excuse to be able to punish either the ukraine or georgia or to flex their muscles in the caucasus and this is something theyve been anticipating for some time
5363139 how do you respond to the argument that by pushing for georgia to be in nato by pushing for ukraine to be in nato by putting a missile defense system in czechoslovakia this was seen as belligerent and aggressive by putin and kind of brought him in
5363140 you know what we are going to let the former soviet satellite states become part of nato

5363174 young people need to understand that carrying a knife just like carrying a gun is dangerous and wrong
5363175 but government and the police cant solve this problem by themselves we need to change the way young people think about knives we need families and communities working together and we need influential role models

5363179 they tried to resuscitate him two times one time he came back for about an hour then he went into cardiac arrest the second time
5363180 he told his wife non verbally that he could breathe on his own and he wanted the ventilator out he motioned that he wanted it out
5363181 but because he had it his immune system was compromised he had an infection he was on a new medication that suppresses the immune system and thats where the pneumonia came from
5363182 he was critically ill when he was in the hospital
5363183 shes devastated however shes at peace about his transition because of her faith in god her faith is what is sustaining her
5363184 they had 30 years of marriage thats unprecedented in todays time particularly for celebrities that brings joy to her they loved each other and respected each other on a daily basis she was by his side to the very end
5363185 when they started dating he said girl you better come on board this train because im going to be rich and her response was okay and they were married thats how he charmed her with his sense of humor
5363186 when they got married they were kids he was 20 and she was 19 they both grew up together and they both matured in this marriage
5363187 what she will treasure the most is the fact that she was his wife for 30 years and not only was she his wife but she was his best friend shes going to miss him dearly

5363205 there was no pushing there was no slugging there was no swinging of arms there was no tussle nothing like that
5363206 her personal security travis was driving lisaraye was in the back seat i was in the passenger side of the jeep
5363207 we pulled up to her home we had been to the grocery store shed bought food to make tacos so we had groceries in the back of the car
5363208 we got up to the house the guards spoke to her and then proceeded to pick up the phone lisaraye said oh you dont have to pick up the phone to announce me but he proceeded to do so and closed the door to the guard shack with lisaraye standing there he caught her between the door and him her security travis then got out of the car and pulled the door so the guard would not hurt her
5363209 travis never touched the security guard at all lisaraye then walked through the guard house into the property of her home travis was behind her and i was sitting in the truck on the passenger side i then got behind the drivers seat and backed the truck up
5363210 but what ive been told by lisaraye and travis is that there was no belligerence
5363211 when they arrived michael was having a meeting with some of his ministers on the patio
5363212 i was told lisaraye came in she waved two of the people on the patio saw her but she didnt see michael michael then all of a sudden appeared and started walking up the walk toward the house
5363213 lisaraye was walking toward their library study and michael said you should not be here what are you doing here she said what are you talking about michael this is my home they went into the library and one of michaels security guards grabbed first ladys hand and snatched a recorder she had in her hand
5363214 pushed lisaraye and her guard out the front door of the house
5363215 she was treated and then after her treatment she went to the police department and we filed an initial complaint she was there for 6 hours
5363216 the original reason we came and were meeting with michael at michaels request is to come up with a settlement as far as temporary support until there is a decree and finally divorce jeter told us
5363217 so just like any woman from the states if you separate then theres spousal support until you get a final decree and then the final decree determines what the terms of the divorce will be whether theres property settlement or whatever it may be
5363218 will continue to do work with them and support their networks
5363219 i remember him telling me back in the day that if you wanted to know real estate youve got to hang out with real estate investors if you wanted to know sports youve got to hang out with athletes i wanted to know tv so i hung out with bob and learned the tv game from one of the best in the business
5363220 i believe that there is a market in our community for a new diverse network that provides a new brand of superior programming that caters to all aspects of television from reality to original programming
5363221 neither one of us could probably answer why we were getting one in the first place
5363222 things have been going so great that someone actually had to remind us that hey you do remember those papers are still there literally it was days ago
5363223 so weve agreed that before we leave florida in a few days well make sure that thats gone away
5363224 secretive about her assets particularly with respect to certain properties owned or titled in either her name alone or in other entities
5363225 correct accounting of all money funds stocks bonds and other securities including bearer securities
5363226 the kids and i kind of learned about the divorce at the same time so that was hard that was probably the worst part of the whole thing was being able to deal with how hurt the whole kids were
5363227 i get the complaint of oh i wish i could see that
5363228 there was nowhere i could find that was just safe where maybe a slip of the finger would take us somewhere where i dont want the kids to see or hear
5363229 friends of many faiths and traditions will join the family to pay tribute to the music legend and reflect upon his life through speeches musical performances photos and video clips

5363259 the trouble is in picking him i have not seen any bowler like this he is an unusual bowler we need to take singles off him and murali and look to attack the others because you have got to have something on the board you can t score 180 or 200 and look to defend that you have to get a decent score for which we will have to score off each and every bowler

5363325 for me the most depressing the worse thing that has happened with wolf parade is how the media pit me and spencer against each other
5363326 face control is practised at the doors of many upmarket ukrainian russian nightclubs and is similar to dress code regulations enforced at many western clubs the major difference is that potential patrons are judged by their attractiveness as well as what they are wearing if you hear the words sorry members only it usually means they think youre a minger

5363332 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5363333 it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face

5363348 with more than 1 million recreational boaters this unnecessary permit requirement would have hit florida hard
5363349 requiring family boaters to secure a clean water act permit so that they can wash their boat fish or go waterskiing is unreasonable costly and essentially unenforceable mobilizing the epa to take on this needless task would have been an additional cost and burden to families and a tremendous waste of taxpayer resources
5363350 most charter boats dont have the ballast issue that is the target of the court ruling there ought to be an opportunity to study where additional regulation is necessary and where it isnt
5363351 this bill provides a reprieve for small business owners who are already dealing with rising fuel prices and a troubled economy

5363353 in light of the current energy crisis congress must take steps to develop domestic resources while encouraging conservation i look forward to congress acting to make it possible for states to engage in offshore development if they so choose and respect the wishes of states like florida that wish to keep drilling at a distance that doesnt impact our environment our economy or the missions of the united states military
5363354 with this issue were reaching out to people who thought we lost our way on fiscal issues
5363355 we hope as a result of that hearing theres going to be a much greater understanding of how big a problem it is
5363356 theres just so many needs in this arena and so little money that for it to be walking out the door with criminals is really a criminal deed itself
5363357 the more realistic approach is to highlight this issue to continue to work on it to continue to build support and then make a really really strong effort the next congress as part of what i believe will be a larger healthcare legislative effort

5363375 hey why not use stuff that we use and have proven can scale up to handle huge loads and huge amounts of data
5363376 this is a real crisis for floridians and the american family inaction from congress is not acceptable
5363377 more production is part of the equation while i have guarded floridas coast there are safe places we can explore including the 8 million acres we opened in the eastern gulf we need to throw everything at the problem more research into new and alternative sources of energy and development of better plug in vehicles in addition conservation is a crucial element
5363378 florida is proud to be the home to the 4th fleet i commend the navys decision to re establish the 4th fleet in jacksonville which demonstrates mayports strategic importance to the region and national security
5363379 the fleets location in jacksonville will provide tremendous support to the u
5363380 this legislation will bring relief to many florida homeowners who face losing their homes the measure also puts long term fixes in place to prevent a housing crisis like this from occurring in the future
5363381 the reform includes a provision to modernize the fha allowing the program to insure larger loans and to reach more families that need help the bill will also provide a stronger oversight system for gses so they are better able to serve homebuyers and fulfill their public mission in addition tax credits for first time homebuyers will encourage those looking to make an initial purchase further helping to stimulate the housing market
5363382 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5363383 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5363384 while we still need to work to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation this strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5363385 i am very pleased with the successful rescue of the three americans keith stansell thomas howes and marc gonsalves former colombian presidential candidate ingrid betancourt and 11 others yesterday after more than five years of untold physical hardships and emotional distress these people will finally be safely reunited with their families i commend the steadfast leadership of president uribe and the professionalism of the colombian armed forces and continue to call on the farc to release all remaining hostages
5363386 as you might be aware on july 1 a cut to medicares physician reimbursement rate went into effect
5363387 my office has been in touch with white house and other administration officials about ways to delay the reimbursement cut while congress works toward a legislative solution
5363388 cutting one area of medicare to help pay for another is bad policy
5363389 it is unfortunate that congress has to act every year to stop payment cuts to doctors
5363390 its nonsense that the u s government is inflating the price of ethanol especially at a time when american families are paying record high prices for fuel
5363391 not only is this tariff costing americans more at the pump its preventing us from diversifying our fuel supply
5363392 if were serious about reducing gas prices in this country removing this tariff and other arbitrary mandates created by congress would help reduce record high fuel costs
5363393 although congress has taken a number of steps to help alleviate the current housing crisis we need to proactively put practices in place that will help prevent another crisis down the road
5363394 setting minimum national standards for all residential mortgage loan originators will go a long way toward achieving that goal i am pleased this measure is included as part of the broader housing package
5363395 this broad housing legislation that the senate passed today will help hundreds of thousands of americans keep their homes
5363396 and the safe mortgage licensing act will ensure that americas mortgage brokers and lenders are ethical professionals unfortunately weve heard countless stories of bad actors in this industry people who engage in fraudulent lending practices such as steering people into loans they clearly cannot afford simply put the only way to crack down on these abuses is to ensure that brokers and lenders meet basic standards and earn a license this legislation does exactly that
5363397 my commitment to doctors has always been to make certain they do not suffer pay cuts due to a faulty medicare reimbursement formula
5363398 the measure we moved forward today does not provide the kind of solution doctors deserve but this is the only option to stop doctors in florida from having their pay cut by 10

5363419 despite the quid pro quo nature of the deal we believe google will benefit disproportionately from this deal over time given the enticing opportunity to take a peek under the hood at yahoo s non search business and the possibility to leverage those insights to improve its growing display business if google is able to provide better yield at the tail end yahoo could face increased risk of affiliates migrating to google overtime
5363420 importantly the broader deal with a search and non search components could have a higher probability of clearing regulatory hurdles in our opinion instead of denying a stand alone search deal on the basis of googles dominant search market share the regulators will be forced to evaluate this broader advertising deal where no single company enjoys a significant market lead

5363651 mirkin and graduate student hyo jae yoon achieved their pcr inspired small molecule detection system by using a supramolecular complex that recognizes acetate and catalyzes a reaction that generates more acetate under basic conditions acetate displaces the thioethers opening the complex and forming a cavity capable of catalyzing an acyl transfer reaction between pyridyl carbinol and acetic anhydride the reaction is coupled to a fluorescent readout with a ph sensitive dye the catalyzed reaction generates more acetate which in turn activates more catalyst in a cascade of reactions the methods applicability is limited only by the creativity of a chemist trying to design a structure to recognize a molecule of interest mirkin says such molecules of interest could range from chemical weapons and biological toxins to neurotransmitters and small molecule disease markers

5363694 we have always said that china is not an export led economy it is driven by domestic demand we think the supply side is going to have a harder time keeping up with demand than people think
5363695 our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions rising input prices skills shortages and the further devaluation of the us dollar
5363696 i think there is a difference between those commodities more leveraged to the emerging economies and those more leveraged to the developed economies
5363697 to remain high relative to historical levels albeit with higher volatility
5363698 the outlook still looks good even though there may be some impact over the next six months from the weakness in western economies bhp doesnt appear to be too worried because of the ongoing demand coming from chinas industrialisation

5363705 the meat industry action group is now forced to conclude that silver fern farms are treating their shareholders with contempt
5363706 we were on a path to setting dates so were a bit perplexed as to why they have taken the action they did
5363707 that is not to say the latter is not important the board will be in a better position to comment on the issues to be considered in light of the outcome of the pgg wrightson partnership proposal vote on september 8 and the alliance group shareholders meeting on september 5 to consider the action group issues
5363708 while both of these members are clearly grandstanding in a vain attempt to revive flagging popularity and impending obscurity this is a serious matter and should be treated as such
5363709 from the outset let me declare that i reject any claim of contempt of parliament the facts simply dont support the claims which have been levelled
5363710 the assertion that i knowingly breached standing orders by not disclosing the situation of multi millionaire owen glenn paying legal costs does not make sense the blunt fact is there is and was no debt

5363760 outplacement service is a global practice but in recent times we have seen mncs adopting it in india the demand for such services has picked up steam since the beginning of 2008 and we have offered outplacement assistance to three mncs for almost 250 employees
5363761 we have received profiles of between 1 000 and 1 200 employees in the last three months and this has been initiated by the hr departments of companies in the it and bpo space
5363762 after specifically communicating to employees that the company cannot retain them anymore hr chiefs typically contact recruitment firms for help
5363763 however that is not an industry norm as yet and in most instances the recruitment firm gets paid by the new employer after the candidate is successfully placed
5363764 it companies were hiring aggressively earlier but given the brisk pace of business they were unable to let go of the bottom 10 per cent workforce despite the fact that such employees did not pass the performance muster that is changing now with the us slowdown affecting new projects companies are taking stock weeding out non performers and then recruiting afresh to bridge the shortfall

5363772 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5363773 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5363774 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5363775 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5363776 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5363777 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory

5363850 no contundente a los agronegocios porque producen destrucci n de montes y bosques nativos expulsa comunidades campesinas criminaliza la protesta social contamina tierras y aguas produce la destrucci n de la biodiversidad apropiaci n de las semillas por parte de las empresas manipulaci n gen tica trabajo en negro explotaci n infantil concentraci n de la tierra en pocas manos p rdida de fuentes de trabajo destrucci n de las econom as regionales atenta contra la salud y vida de los pueblos tanto por el consumo de transg nicos como por las fumigaciones
5363851 las propuestas de cambio son dif ciles de encarar pero algunas ya tienen su materializaci n concretamente como la del mocase y la idea de soberan a alimentaria son una manifestaci n concreta de que se puede encarar las cosas de otra manera pero c mo se resuelve la producci n del conjunto del sistema agropecuario argentino eso es algo a seguir profundizando
5363852 la uac es la expresi n de una necesidad que tenemos todas las asambleas fundamentalmente ambientales de intercambiar nuestras experiencias y vivencias respecto a esta lucha en eso se ha progresado much simo por la inclusi n de m s organizaciones y por la profundizaci n de los temas que cada asamblea toca

5363855 la lucha que se viene se presenta en dos grandes ramas la miner a del oro por un lado y la del uranio por otro
5363856 en el resto de las provincias hemos dado pasos importantes hemos logrado leyes contra la mega miner a metal fera contaminante en patagonia mendoza tucum n la rioja y hay presentaciones para prohibirla en san luis y en c rdoba tambi n
5363857 lo que impulsa la c mara minera junto al gobierno nacional y las provincias es zonificar generando espacios donde s se podr hacer la miner a con el m todo contaminante justamente en sitios donde no est n de pie y luchando las comunidades
5363858 el uranio surge de golpe cuando su precio se dispara ante la acci n de los pa ses del primer mundo que buscan combatir el precio del petr leo con fuentes alternativas de energ a dentro de la cnea hay quienes quieren poner en licitaci n los grandes yacimientos otros quieren hacer canje con otros pa ses para el desarrollo local de la energ a nuclear y otros consideran que esos minerales tienen que ser utilizados s lo en lo dom stico mediante centrales nucleares por eso en argentina se relanza un plan nuclear de cuatro centrales en lo inmediato
5363859 con esta iniciativa se busca realizar una masiva tarea de concientizaci n en la poblaci n a fin de que se comprenda sobre las herramientas que desde el gobierno se otorga a las mineras para que se instalen destruyan saqueen y contaminen

5363863 in other words the inherent spatial aspect of action representations could be a product of the writing system we use rather than the wiring of our brain

5363866 its everyones dream but its something ive always wanted and its what i have now im going to stretch it and take advantage of it sure its a lot of pressure but you know what its worth it and its worth signing something for someone even if youre on your own personal time which is something im notorious for doing when i go out with my friends and when i do get recognized i say hello i do sign things people say why are you doing that making as much as i do those people are the ones that make my career and thats something i never forget

5363922 the advantages of proximity marketing include free transmission for both the sending and receiving parties the ability to send rich content such as video music and even java applications the ability to target an audience locally to within 10 to 30 feet and the relevant novelty of the application
5363923 the debate certainly exists but we havent seen any complaints from consumers at events where the bluetooth sig has deployed proximity marketing
5363924 in fact acceptance rates for pushed content are very dependent on having signage nearby to instruct recipients due to the very small transmission radius and the need for user input on many phones this is very much an opt in means of advertising

5364054 as a matter of fact bill atlas is the one who contacted his superior immediately when he found out about it so its not a question of wanting it to go away i think that they were both concerned about what happened i think that they were looking into the situation
5364055 he looked at t j and basically said to him youre a sexual predator or words to that effect
5364056 and you know if you put a knife through his heart it probably wouldnt have hurt any more than that
5364057 we went boating as a family we went to dinner afterward and somebody came up to my son and im trying to hear what is being said and it was about the baseball team
5364058 nana do you know who that is he was on the bus nana he was on the bus
5364059 its like living in a country but not really being in it
5364060 lines that back up the different actions that have developed hes in the middle of this firestorm and hes completely restricted he doesnt do what he used to do
5364061 my understanding from all the information i have is that this type of conduct with the bullying and the physical contact has gone on for some time
5364062 i certainly dont think it is something that is unique only to wilson but again i think it was situations that were on the bus that were not intended to be in any way violent or anything other than high school kids doing what a lot of high school kids do
5364063 it was overcharged and then it snowballed you know with the local media and press
5364064 and i cant blame them the way it was released you hear the term sodomy or violation with a cell phone with 16 year olds its going to get somebodys attention
5364065 my client hes extremely likable hes got a na vet about him hes a genuine person not some kind of thug wearing a baseball cap sideways hes a nice kid and i want to see it work out for him
5364066 knew or should have known that dangerous tortuous sic behavior might occur on the bus rides
5364067 what i can tell you is im the superintendent i feel i failed the district
5364068 i feel that to some degree this was under my watch did the district fail i think that certainly remains to be seen
5364069 you could see the passion pouring out for the coaches the passion pouring out for the kids i think that it was remarkable what we saw tonight there are two sides to every story and these are seasoned veterans my kids have been coached by these coaches but i still think we need to remain vigilant and wait and see what the investigation turns up in regards to baia and atlas
5364070 and thats just on the bus if something happens in school if they had the same reaction to what happened on the bus i dont think the coaches should keep their jobs
5364071 the thing is kids dont have anything to do here
5364072 i am a leader by default only because nature does not allow a vacuum
5364073 es una idea est pida por ser tan ambiciosa mientras llega la recesi n econ mica
5364074 pero eso era cuando el doble campe n del mundo fernando alonso hab a propulsado a la f rmula 1 a la primera l nea de deportes de espa a

5364077 i fell off the stage and landed on my head during a show in japan
5364078 i had a concussion and got x rays of my head i just wanted to recount it literally because when you are that literal it can produce a surreal effect the song is kind of about public failure or perceived public failure the video could almost consist of famous shots of important people at their worst moments where everyones watching
5364079 thats about nouveau riche bourgeois motherfuckers who forget how close they are to being the servant
5364080 ive seen so many people like that in spas fancy shops and yoga studios
5364081 people who dont tip their waitress and walk around bumming out baristas when theyre supposed to be in some kind of spiritual place
5364082 one of the things thats not often said in pop songs or in real life for that matter is how sad it is to spend significant time with someone and realize that you just dont know each other because the most important things are completely off limits
5364083 thats a failure not many people are happy to admit
5364084 i think shes one of the best singers out there shes just so talented
5364085 its both a love song and a break up song
5364086 the 4 3 2 1 chorus comes out of two people on the phone not wanting to hang up like when you finally go okay weve gotta hang up well count it down and then well both hang up
5364087 put on a pair of diapers and drove 18 hours to kill her boyfriend
5364088 that was exactly what was going on in my mind when i wrote it so i left it in you do a song a real disservice by going too wide sometimes
5364089 first off can i just point out that this is the first time ive ever personally written the word bitch into a song
5364090 ex ben folds five drummer darren jessee wrote the give me my money back you bitch line on whatever and ever amen s song for the dumped and then we covered dr dres bitches aint shit so ive become the bitch guy which is one reason i didnt want this song on the record

5364103 for those who have been anxiously awaiting mccains pick as a signal of his ideological intentions
5364104 that choice will end his bid for the presidency and spell defeat for other republican candidates
5364105 settle d the concerns of social conservatives who have been rattled by reports that he might be considering a pro choice running mate
5364106 after saturday night even republicans most skeptical of mccain must conclude perhaps we arent doomed after all
5364107 the republican party would accept a pro choice running mate
5364108 he is also passionately a believer that the republican party must have a big tent but he would have a strong pro life administration the vice president is not an independent voice he echoes the position of the president of the united states i think thats the responsibility of the vice president if youre unwilling or unable to do that then i think you should defer to someone else
5364109 mccains veep would have absolutely no bearing on abortion laws whatsoever
5364110 social conservatives would be sacrificing the opportunity to elect a fully pro life president

5364163 we have always said that china is not an export led economy it is driven by domestic demand we think the supply side is going to have a harder time keeping up with demand than people think

5364220 one of the reasons that the stock exchange rose slightly was an end to uncertainty

5364558 i deny the charges that the economic crisis is caused by policies of my government in the past nine years
5364559 todays brief period of market upsurge was more to do with some relief that this impasse is over
5364560 but in the long term it will depend on whether the coalition government can stick together
5364561 what pakistan really needs is some sort of stability so that there can be consistency in policies and some control over inflation
5364562 one of the reasons that the stock exchange rose slightly was an end to uncertainty
5364563 but a different sort of uncertainty can take grip if things are not under control someone needs to be seen to be at the helm
5364564 the downside of it is that the faces that we are seeing are the same old faces
5364565 but we can hope that civil society is stronger that business communities are stronger
5364566 we have a lot of problems but concentration of power is not the solution
5364567 what we need is a stable government for the next four or five years

5364634 art 180 partners with other nonprofit organizations to serve children living in challenging circumstances in richmond virginia through our programs youth discover ways they can positively engage in and influence their surroundings professional artists and volunteers work with youth after school for 12 weekly sessions each program grows from the needs and interests of the group of young people being served the young artists are asked to explore crucial personal statements that reinforce their sense of identity and purpose such as what is a hero what do i want people to know about me how can i make my community a better place programs culminate with some kind of public presentation of artwork these have included billboards art exhibits poetry readings cds and dvds by merging the private creative experience with a public showcase art 180 offers youth a safe way to talk about what matters most to them while offering the community a compelling way to hear it

5364636 i must register my disappointment that our bishops conference recently could not agree a collegial response to the governments legislation on same sex adoption
5364637 flat and safe at a time when we need passionate and courageous public statements that dare to speak the full truth in love
5364638 the catholic community includes people of heterosexual homosexual and bi sexual orientation
5364639 every human being whatever his or her sexual orientation has the right to live a life free from discrimination and harassment and we welcome new legislation which protects this right
5364640 moreover people of all sexual orientations have a right to take a full and active part in the life of the catholic community
5364641 catholic teaching of course makes a distinction between sexual orientation and sexual activity and it holds that all men and women are called to a life of chastity and to fidelity if they choose to marry
5364642 catholic organisations and institutions ask their members and staff to respect this teaching
5364643 in reaching a balance between individuals private and family lives and their responsibilities within the organisation consideration may need to be given to the nature of the role and organisation in question
5364644 reluctant to speak out on these issues as if somehow they had handed over their competence in these areas to the responsible bishops and his particular committee
5364645 following up on what i said after the press conference i have sought advice from my advisory on professional standards
5364646 i have asked the committee to advise me on an appropriate formal response to you that committee has now had its first meeting and i am expecting their advice within a few weeks
5364647 i will communicate with you again as soon as i receive that advice i wish to restate that i am happy to meet with you if that is your wish
5364648 also pending the recommendations of my advisory committee i have asked the chancellor of the archdiocese fr john usher to make himself available to speak with you if you feel that a conversation with him would be helpful
5364649 he wrote that he wanted to meet with me but he doesnt want to debate the facts or discuss the issues
5364650 talks are going extremely well and these talks take a while
5364651 these talks are just about david villa and valencia no other player and all thats needed is time
5364652 any risk of more serious damage has been exorcized which would have meant missing most of the season
5364653 i already had less pain this morning but i was still a bit tense until i got the results they definitely took a big weight off my chest
5364654 now ill concentrate on resting for a few days and then ill start working to get back on the pitch but without rushing
5364655 i just want to thank all my team mates my friends and the fans who have been expressing their sympathy to me since last night

5364680 football is like making love if you cant last 90 minutes like me you wont win
5364681 if theyd been like anyone else in the general public you would have expected it to go up 50 percent
5364682 the things that affect the general public are the things that affect our military as well
5364683 but they do have some stopgaps in place to help them more so than the average citizen
5364684 if people bought high in 2005 and have to move now they may be caught with negative equity in their house because the value has started to fall
5364685 we have resources available and encourage members to take advantage of the financial services and counseling available through their installation
5364686 we want to keep our men and women overseas especially the ones in harms way concentrating on the mission at hand and the important tasks they have to accomplish rather than their financial situation at home
5364687 theyre not going to be keeping their eye on the target if theyre worried about stuff back home
5364688 we look at the family and the servicemember as a team
5364689 so this is really a matter of allowing the servicemember to focus on his job and allowing the spouse and the family to focus on their job so together we can accomplish the mission

5364700 job security and health care are huge here he needs to come to the aisle of home depot and show them that a harvard graduate which i am as well knows how to help them
5364701 when i got to beijing i was incredibly tired and the first few days practicing were very hard
5364702 the only reason i was able to win was the lift i got from living in the olympic village being among many other great athletes was fantastic and the support i got from the rest of the spanish team was amazing
5364703 although they dont know it it was thanks to them that i somehow found the energy and mental strength to get the gold medal
5364704 i enjoyed it a lot more than a normal tournament
5364705 your mental health is paramount so do anything it takes to make yourself happy
5364706 i knew it was fast but i cant believe it were the best team in the world
5364707 i wasnt my usual self in qualifying yesterday and i didnt want to let these guys down its just fantastic
5364708 it was an incredible dominating ride by the team and just an awesome display
5364709 well done to brad for equalling my six medals but hes only a youngster at 28 hes only just started he must have at least two more olympics in him and he and chris hoy could both beat my gold medal total
5364710 they are inspirational figures i got switched on to the olympics by watching mark sptiz as a ten year old in 1972 and hopefully there is a young generation of british kids who are excited by watching a series of great british performances here
5364711 in an era where media consolidation is occurring at an all too rapid pace its essential to look for alternative news sources that are free from corporate bias the future of our rather stupid species depends on it sites like yours have made a massive impact on me over the last year im very grateful
5364712 spiderednews is a really good resource thanks for the effort and time you put in to providing it
5364713 you know theyre in deep pain but its not just physical pain its psychological pain that you can see here at the hospital weve seen women whove stopped living
5364714 there are children i think the youngest was three years old
5364715 i think because of the widespread nature of the war because there has been so much violence rape is now on a daily basis rape is the norm
5364716 women get raped in wars all the time how is it different here
5364717 i think whats different in congo is the scale and the systematic nature of it indeed as well the brutality this is not rape because soldiers have got bored and have nothing to do it is a way to ensure that communities accept the power and authority of that particular armed group this is about showing terror this is about using it as a weapon of war
5364718 i was lying on the ground and they gave a flashlight to my younger brother so that he could see them raping me
5364719 they raped me like they were animals one after another when the first one finished they washed me out with water told me to stand up so the next man could rape me
5364720 they wanted him to rape me but he refused and told them i cannot do such a thing i cannot rape my sister so they took out their knives and stabbed him to death in front of me
5364721 i was thinking that they had killed i didnt think i would find them alive
5364722 when a woman is raped its not just her thats raped its the entire community thats destroyed
5364723 when they take a woman to rape her theyll line up the family theyll line up other members of the communities to actually witness that
5364724 they make them watch and so what that means for that particular woman when its all over is that total shame personally to have been witnessed by so many people as shes being violated
5364725 why would somebody do that why would somebody shoot a woman inside
5364726 in the beginning i was asking myself the same question this is a show of force of power its done to destroy the person
5364727 sex is being used to commit evil people flee they become refugees they cant get help they become malnourished and its disease which finishes them off
5364728 the most difficult thing is when there is nothing i can do when i see a 16 year old a pretty 16 year old whos had everything destroyed and i tell her that i have to give her a colostomy bag that is difficult
5364729 the fact is the justice system is on its knees in congo
5364730 i can count on one hand the number of cases that were aware of that have been brought to trial literally here people get away with rape they get away with murder the chances of being arrested are nil
5364731 i named her luck because i went through many hardships
5364732 i could have been killed in the forest but i got my life back i have hope
5364733 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5364734 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5364735 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5364736 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5364737 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5364738 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5364739 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia

5364743 figures released by the ministry of justice for the second quarter of 2008 revealed for mortgage and landlord possession were considerably higher than last year
5364744 these staggering figures show just how hard many welsh families are finding it to stay afloat the number of mortgage possession claims in wales is up 22 per cent from last year compared with a 17 per cent increase in england and wales
5364745 labours economic boom has been underpinned by unsustainable levels of household debt
5364746 as the economy feels the heat welsh families are the ones getting burned
5364747 the government needs to do everything it can to ease the financial burden on welsh families struggling to make ends meet before we see a surge in welsh homelessness this is a serious situation
5364748 it is a worrying trend our bureaus are reporting a sharp increase in the number of mortgage arrears problems they are dealing with these latest figures paint a worrying picture
5364749 before this system was introduced there had been no reports of any accidents on the road but now there has been and we need to do something to address the problem
5364750 we hope to set a date for a public consultation at our next council meeting in september
5364751 i think it is because i am trying to help people someone has stepped in to help me
5364752 the person who will help pay my charges was apparently touched by cancer in his family many years ago and the system has not changed since then
5364753 epileptics and diabetics get free prescriptions and so should people with cancer
5364754 the financial implications of cancer are horrendous and we are desperate for a re think on prescription charges right now because the credit crunch is making things worse
5364755 its been really tough because its bad enough to have everything you treasure taken away by the cancer but the lack of advice and support just makes it worse
5364756 one man filled up on the pump the car was parked next to and the second man went to the unattended pump next to it
5364757 this will make it easier for the thieves to get caught and we have no doubt they will be caught if they carry on
5364758 dyfed powys police has had more than 50 reports of diesel thefts from vehicles storage tanks and petrol stations this year and we will be doing all we can to clampdown on this problem
5364759 the price of both diesel fuel and heating oil has been rising constantly this has led to increases in theft of diesel
5364760 you may as well roll it all up by the gate with a notice saying help yourself
5364761 when our lead was stolen in march the miscreants got 106 for it but it will cost just under 1 700 to replace it until the price of metal drops there will be no let up
5364762 it will be a huge burden on the congregation and the church organisation to find the money to pay for it no one can really afford to pay for repairs just to keep thieves happy with metal
5364763 its a very very serious situation it seems as soon as one lot of them have been put away the next lot come in and the police are only having limited success
5364764 its just a shame that they pick on struggling community projects it will affect their own families and people that they know everyone has a community thats local to them and at some stage some member of their family will want to use the community facilities
5364765 we are desperately trying to keep the hall going and the next thing someone comes along and steals lead from the roof we are just trying really hard to keep ticking over
5364766 because the price of scrap metal is so expensive there are particular metals in catalytic converters which have considerable scrap value
5364767 if people go to the website and read some of the comments i think it will allay some of their fears
5364768 there is no hiding place for average by that i mean all average products services locations and staff
5364769 we about to enter a period of the most significant change in food retailing since the introduction of self service supermarkets small changes are not going to save retailers it is time to realign themselves with a whole new relevance to what consumers want
5364770 retailers beware our consumers are changing their buying habits a great deal faster than you think
5364771 by acting now you have a fighting chance to avoid being average the first challenge for anyone running a retail outlet is realising that you need to make this change
5364772 i just wanted to qualify through the rounds that was my first aim
5364773 this week has not been one for the feint hearted
5364774 we are not all buddy buddy in the team at the moment we all have a job to do
5364775 when the job is over then youll see what it means to be a jamaican
5364776 as ernesto che guevara said friendship ends where duty starts and we are representing the venezuelan people here
5364777 we have spent a lot of time in cuba we even know the players homes it is the cuban school of the past 40 years that we stand for so we had mixed feelings in todays game
5364778 we will try our best to make this a reality these olympics games have given me more experience and i am proud of my team
5364779 americans need to have peace of mind that they have life insurance coverage when traveling abroad people should not be denied coverage or have to pay outrageous amounts for a policy based on where they travel
5364780 this legislation ensures that insurance companies cannot use future travel plans as a basis to increase rates or cancel coverage it is my hope that the banking committee will act quickly to pass the lift act so that it can move to the full senate for consideration
5364781 the report released today further demonstrates why agencies need tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5364782 medicare fraud is not only hurting seniors but it is also wasting taxpayer dollars instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5364783 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5364784 in the long term we need to take full advantage of our domestic resources which includes developing our oil supplies and also increasing our use of nuclear power nuclear power is safe emissions free power that can be used to make our nation energy independent

5364801 sonian was looking for both cost effective and scalable computing power that reduced time to market for their digital content archiving offering
5364802 having the vertica analytic database available on demand in amazon ec2 enables software as a service innovators like sonian to give customers faster more affordable and more scalable access to business analytic data
5364803 sarbanes oxley and other federal and industry mandates are going to continue to drive the need to effectively archive digital content
5364804 so we knew we were going to need a cloud database that not only delivered fast query response but also easily scaled to meet demand the vertica analytic database for the cloud was the obvious choice it offered unbeatable performance with no administration overhead and will scale within the cloud as our customer base and their archives grow
5364805 sonian is a progressive company that knows the significant potential that cloud computing presents
5364806 by combining affordable flexible digital archiving with scalable hyper fast querying against enormous databases sonian is providing a remarkable security and compliance solution to its customers together sonian vertica and amazon give companies confidence that they will find the answers they need on demand
5364807 this can affect vision over time via prolonged and persistent poor lighting
5364808 high gas prices are the single most important issue to americans right now and we need to focus on solutions for short term relief and long term domestic energy development
5364809 companies like csx are an important part of the long term strategy which will have to incorporate reliable available and inexpensive sources of energy
5364810 this law will bring immediate relief to the suffering homeowners facing foreclosure while addressing long term changes necessary to strengthen the housing industry
5364811 this is a prime example of how effective congress can be when legislators put politics aside and come together in a bi partisan manner to best serve the american people during a time of crisis
5364812 having an office at the usf tampa campus will provide better accessibility for people seeking assistance with federal issues
5364813 i am excited to join the usf community and look forward to serving gulf coast residents at this location
5364814 our bill will give agencies the tools to stop fraud at the front end rather than having the department of justice get involved at the back end after the fraud has occurred
5364815 instead of continuing the current practice of pay and chase the federal government needs to shift to a policy of detect and prevent
5364816 this will lead to less fraud and greatly reduce identity theft among our seniors
5364817 it will also allow seniors and the government to easily take a medicare recipients number out of circulation when fraud is detected
5364818 i compliment the group for coming together in a bipartisan way to try to address the current energy crisis
5364819 the needs of the veterans in this community have grown beyond the navy and va facilities capabilities the clinics are old undersized and substandard the renovations made possible by the joint inventive fund will help but a new facility still needs to be built

5364821 florida has been hit hard by the housing crisis ranking second in the nation in record foreclosures last year this bill is the product of congress coming together to address this crisis and bring relief to floridians who face losing their homes
5364822 while addressing the current crisis this also strengthens the housing market for the long term modernization of the fha will allow the program to serve more families after the recent problems with freddie mac and fannie mae it is clear that we need a stronger oversight system for gses to better fulfill their public mission and this bill puts that system in place
5364823 the current crisis has shown us that while some homeowners unfortunately made bad financial decisions others were clearly taken advantage of by bad actors in the housing industry national licensing standards will help decrease the number of unscrupulous loan originators and predatory mortgages
5364824 the safe act will help to eliminate fraudulent loan originators from the housing industry and give more reassurance to homebuyers at a time when they are making an important financial commitment in purchasing a home
5364825 this is the first step in working to make appraisal standards uniform across the nation
5364826 this provision strengthens standards for fha appraisals and ensures the integrity of the new fha program that offers foreclosure assistance
5364827 uit het onderzoek van temenos blijft dat 40 procent van de technologische en financi le kaders uit de financi le sector verwacht dat de uct budgetten met minstens 5 procent zullen opgedreven worden
5364828 nog eens 14 procent is van mening dat de budgetten lichtelijk zullen stijgen terwijl 32 procent denkt dat het informatica budget ongewijzigd zal blijven slechts 11 procent verwacht dat het budget zal teruggeschroefd worden en meer dan 80 procent is van oordeel dat de ict budgetten voor risicobeheer zullen opgedreven worden

5364853 the real weakness of his as i see it is that he has never realized the importance of institutions
5364854 he just leaves all the institutions of pakistan so weak including the political ones who are to now run the affairs of the country
5364855 onward his standing was on shaky grounds and the power began to slip away from him
5364856 musharraf was a hotheaded and impulsive political leader from day 1 to the end
5364857 this was very unfortunate that he always put his personal ambitions ahead of the interests of the people of pakistan
5364858 for the last years he has been ruling the country and hes been no good to it
5364859 so i think it is better that he has resigned and its over now

5364905 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5364906 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military

5364929 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment

5365286 i dont think that the fact that breasts can be seen more does anything to take away peoples desire to see breasts

5365288 when they started making the mega augmented breast there was an interest because it was so cartoonishly fascinating the men wanted to see them but then as they went to strip clubs and saw them and saw them begin to deteriorate and deform and they began to see the obvious scars the horror factor took over and it occurred to them that these were not soft breasts and the trend just evaporated

5365312 what this world needs is not another one hit wonder with an axe to grind another two bit politician peddling lies another three ring circus society what this world needs is not another sign waving super saint thats better than you another ear pleasing candy man afraid of the truth another prophet in an armani suit what this world needs is a savior who will rescue a spirit who will lead a father who will love them in their time of need a savior who will rescue a spirit who will lead a father who will love thats what this world needs what this world needs is for us to care more about the inside than the outside have we become so blind that we cant see gods gotta change her heart before he changes her shirt what this world needs is for us to stop hiding behind our relevance blending in so well that people cant see the difference and its the difference that sets the world free jesus is our savior thats what this world needs fathers arms around you thats what this world needs thats what this world needs
5365313 people arent confused by the gospel theyre confused by us jesus is the only way to god but we are not the only way to jesus this world doesnt need my tie my hoodie my denomination or my translation of the bible they just need jesus we can be passionate about what we believe but we can not strap ourselves to the gospel because were slowing it down jesus is going to save the world but maybe the best thing that we can do is just get out of the way
5365314 8 for it is by grace you have been saved through faith and this not from yourselves it is the gift of god 9 not by works so that no one can boast 10 for we are gods workmanship created in christ jesus to do good works which god prepared in advance for us to do
5365315 the wind is moving but i am standing still a life of pages waiting to be filled a heart thats hopeful i head thats full of dreams but this becoming is harder than it seems feels like im looking for a reason roamin for the night to find my place in this world my place in this world not a lot to lean on i need your light to help me find my place in this world my place in this world if there are millions down on their knees among the many can you still hear me hear me asking where do i belong is there a vision that i can call my own

5365319 ive never had a good female boss they are always a nightmare
5365320 yeah all my experiences working for other women have pretty much been terrible
5365321 this is a woman who somehow lucked into a position that is well beyond her skill level but shell be damned if she lets anyone take it all away from her
5365322 theres only room at the top for one female and its me
5365323 great but i cant come to dinner this weekend since im working on a presentation for my boss and after that i have to overhaul our recruiting process and present it in the next two weeks
5365324 for gods sake people were talking about processed cheese spread
5365325 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5365326 i think the russians will pull out but will damage georgia strongly
5365327 georgia will survive but russia has lost its credibility in the eyes of the world
5365328 i think there needs to be a strong unified response to russia to send the message that this kind of behavior characteristic of the soviet period has no place in the 21st century
5365329 if someone thinks that our citizens can be killed soldiers and officers who are peacekeepers killed with impunity we will never permit that
5365330 anyone who tries to do so will face a crushing response

5365346 it was christmas day we were allowed to stand outside of our cell for a few minutes and those days we were not allowed to see or communicate with each other although we certainly did and i was standing outside for a few minutes outside my cell he came walking up he stood there for a minute and with his sandal on the dirt in the courtyard he drew a cross and he stood there and a minute later he rubbed it out and walked away for a minute there there was just two christians worshiping together ill never forget that moment
5365347 leaving his shovel on the ground he slowly walked to a crude bench and sat down he knew that at any moment a guard would order him to stand up and when he failed to respond the guard would beat him to death probably with his own shovel he had seen it happen to other prisoners as he waited head down he felt a presence slowly he looked up and saw a skinny old prisoner squat down beside him the man said nothing instead he used a stick to trace in the dirt the sign of the cross the man then got back up and returned to his work as solzhenitsyn stared at the cross drawn in the dirt his entire perspective changed he knew he was only one man against the all powerful soviet empire yet he knew there was something greater than the evil he saw in the prison camp something greater than the soviet union he knew that hope for all people was represented by that simple cross through the power of the cross anything was possible

5365366 actually art i only had a pair of twos but judging from miles earlier behavior i figured he would fold and if you ever tell anyone that i was bluffing ill deny it
5365367 early in my career as a strategy consultant i was working on a project for an investment banking client with the ceo of our firm we were presenting a business strategy to the board of directors and senior executive team at a two day offsite held at a private country club in pennsylvania out of the 30 people at the meeting i was the only female and the youngest by far the first day of meetings went well and as the men gathered in the bar upstairs i was getting things prepared for the following day i joined the others in the bar and went to order a drink the bartender looked startled and said im sorry miss you cant come in here thinking this was a joke i laughed and asked again for my drink the bartender repeated sorry you cant come in here and then pointed to a sign above the door that read gentlemen only shocked i asked if the sign was an antique and just a joke this was the early 90s after all no miss thats the rule youll have to leave
5365368 most people dont know that ive been fired twice and quit this company once
5365369 after seeing what happened in new orleans and that area i think early evacuation of visitors is important for safety especially in the keys where we only have one road out lives are more important than revenue
5365370 this is not charley this is not a well formed hurricane
5365371 this isnt the type of storm thats going to rip off a lot of roofs
5365372 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5365373 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5365374 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5365375 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5365376 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5365377 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5365378 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5365379 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5365380 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5365381 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5365382 to go through what i went through and be back on top again im just so blessed right now
5365383 i came to the birds nest to lay a golden egg and thats what i did

5365401 so the politicians got what they wanted and the board said how high should i jump and they did unfortunately the fish smell is worse than ever obviously this was planned to be a done deal from the beginning
5365402 i think this is so crooked from the start barden shouldnt have got it in the first place now he gets to choose who does get the license and make money i think a lot of people crooks need to go to jail every crook on the gaming board go to jail barden jail but because they are rich they are allowed to be crooked this needs investigated by federal prosecutor rich get away with anything what a country
5365403 the whole casino thing is nothing but a big conspiracy don barden had no business getting the casino license in the first place and then because he doesnt have the money the big boys step in to save the day they probably could not have gotten the casino license in the first place but now with everything in doubt the gaming commission approves the new ownership in a flash it took those morons almost a year to come up with barden as the best option and almost instantly the new owners are approved conspiracy
5365404 in his bid for a pittsburgh casino don barden told state gaming investigators hed racked up 11 million in gambling losses because he played with people who wagered excessively including former basketball star michael jordan according to a report obtained by the morning call barden also told the investigators in august 2006 that he had stopped gambling with jordan with whom blackjack bets could run 10 000 per hand and that hed paid down nearly 2 million in gambling debts to various casinos according to an internal pennsylvania gaming control board report report in hand the gaming board in december 2006 awarded barden a slots license last month the detroit businessman lost majority control of pittsburghs majestic star casino amid money problems unrelated to him personally bardens short tenure as majority owner of majestic has drawn additional scrutiny of gaming regulators already being questioned for their licensing approval of scranton area businessman louis denaples owner of the mount airy casino
5365405 pennsylvanias slots casino law is a work in progress ever since it was enacted in 2004 the statute has been poked scorned reviled and revised the latest proposed revision is a raft of improvements put forth by two unlikely allies republican sen jane orie of mccandless who opposed the legalization of slots and democratic sen vincent fumo of philadelphia who wrote the casino law their revisions would toughen the state gaming board broaden the public information on license applicants and reduce the role of politics these are noble objectives and the senators bipartisan approach should win the bill considerable votes if enacted these reforms wont be the last changes made to the slots law but theyll take care of assorted problems that have surfaced in pennsylvanias short experience
5365406 the state gaming control board expects to hold a suitability hearing by mid to late september on centaur inc s request for a racetrack slots license the key element in plans to build a new 430 million track and casino west of new castle in lawrence county centaur officials are still working with their lenders to firm up financing for the project which has been hampered by their inability so far to obtain a slots license from the state and by the ongoing turmoil in the credit markets gaming board investigators said they hope to complete by early september background checks of indianapolis based centaur which now owns a racetrack in indiana and a casino in colorado

5365456 to be an olympic champion is much better than being a world champion the truth is its a medal i really had to fight for
5365457 i liked playing baseball at the time then my brother introduced me to athletics i started to enjoy it and here i am
5365458 i came to beijing in excellent shape today what i was looking for didnt quite happen what i really wanted was to improve my personal best of 8 73 i know im ready to do that today it just didnt happen but i had many things on my mind
5365459 im not totally satisfied but ive achieved my objective of being olympic champion and world champion
5365460 we not only lost the game but we may have also lost our catcher wang wei for the rest of the olympics he got hit in the leg they play hard and we play hard
5365461 if you have a guy at homeplate you never come up and try to hit the guy in the chest i felt that was an illegal slide and the umpire should have ejected him after that the game got out of hand
5365462 we do not throw to hit people he tried to throw the ball inside and it got away from him the umpire lost control of the game he created this
5365463 i felt myself like an actress or a famous singer with the whole stadium just for me
5365464 i told myself i cannot not jump the world record because everyone is expecting me waiting for me
5365465 it made me really angry i said ok how is it possible to speak like this about me she didnt beat me anytime
5365466 i just wanted to prove who is the best at the olympic games
5365467 first of all she must respect me and after to know her position now she knows it
5365468 she came through like a champion like she always does and you know i was doing what i was trying to do
5365469 theres a lot mistakes that happen thats just one of them
5365470 i wish she took a medal from this because she is ready
5365471 i felt myself like an actress or a famous singer with the whole stadium just for me
5365472 i told myself i cannot not jump the world record because everyone is expecting me waiting for me
5365473 it made me really angry i said ok how is it possible to speak like this about me she didnt beat me anytime
5365474 i just wanted to prove who is the best at the olympic games
5365475 first of all she must respect me and after to know her position now she knows it
5365476 she came through like a champion like she always does and you know i was doing what i was trying to do
5365477 theres a lot mistakes that happen thats just one of them
5365478 i wish she took a medal from this because she is ready
5365479 i kind of like the position were in i like going under the radar it makes you know we still have a lot of work to do no one else is giving us credit so we know we got to go out there and earn it
5365480 you feed off that and ive kind of used that as motivation for our team
5365481 we did have one month we still have a lot to prove to ourselves that we are a better team than just one month and why cant we play at a better level than that why do we have the ups and downs in the season like we do why do we have a streak where we play inconsistent football and sloppy football lets get to that consistent team
5365482 really im trying to see both safeties and trying not to get caught up in the free safety and have him tell you what to do
5365483 when you see them both it tells me what the coverage is and i get my read from there
5365484 you saw the focus in him late in the season where it all came together for him he avoided the interceptions did all the things we were talking about along the way he has that ability he has always had it and now i think youre going to see it all the time
5365485 everything eli did is just going to be that much better and hes going to be consistent you can see it in his face how much more relaxed he is about everything
5365486 i immediately regretted leaving the national side so many times i said to myself what an imbecile i have been
5365487 the world champions are not here because of who they are even if ill have feelings for them all my life those in the national squad are here because they deserve it

5365504 the fact is most people are simply unaware of the full functionality of the product
5365505 by being first to market by having a high quality product and by providing high levels of service i think you can build a brand and establish yourself as a premier resource
5365506 within a corporation people are using google every day whether it is sales marketing research and development human resources and recruiting
5365507 the product is ubiquitous in its business use and yet people are not taking advantage of the functionality
5365508 we think the google piece of it is an overlooked piece
5365509 people just take for granted that everybody googles and nobody stops and thinks twice about the inefficiency in the process
5365510 it was a little learning process early in camp but the last 10 days or so ive felt really really comfortable there on the left side
5365511 i feel like im kind of picking up where i left off
5365512 hes played both of them for us and we think hes played at a high level we thought it was natural the way the draft fell and being able to get a tackle in the draft that we felt was worthy of starting we felt that moving gross gave us the best chance at the tackle positions
5365513 honestly its not something im disgruntled about or anything like that
5365514 im not unhappy with it some guys are mad and they hold out
5365515 it didnt work out and i think we had different ideas about the parameters of the contract well see how it goes this year all we can do is have a good year and win some games everyone on the negotiating side gets along and likes each other it just didnt happen
5365516 ive never been a look down the road type of guy
5365517 especially because ive been moving back and forth every year i dont have time to look down the road
5365518 but being on the left side now if i have a great year well that is the spot on the o line that is most touted so that could be a good thing well see what happens
5365519 yeah i think were the side with the older players and the ones they can count on to know whats going on
5365520 right guard keydrick vincent and otah are learning still but they are doing a nice job but we definitely feel like the left side is the side that is going to be accountable every week
5365521 the first game against indianapolis went really well but that was a different type of defense than philadelphia played
5365522 after the rain delay i felt like the first offense did a better job yeah we came out slow and that might be training camp legs i dont know
5365523 whether youre looking at it from a theological perspective or a scientific perspective answering that question with specificity is above my pay grade
5365524 my view on human rights for babies would be so shocking to the average american i refuse to answer this question on national television
5365525 it depends on what the meaning of the word is is
5365526 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news

5365528 now i know how bad my cold is i cant even smell them
5365529 if i was doing this just for myself i might have chosen a different course but i put pakistan first as always
5365530 even if i beat this impeachment relations between the presidency and the government can never be fixed pillars of the state parliament and the judiciary would be harmed and god forbid the army might have been dragged in
5365531 no charge sheet can stand against me because i never did anything for myself whatever i did i put pakistan first

5365539 if it were true that older kids are able to learn at a faster rate then the differences in test scores should get bigger as kids progress and the material gets more difficult but we really see the opposite
5365540 kids learn at lot before kindergarten especially if theyre in preschool one way to think about it is that the oldest kid in kindergarten has about 20 percent more life experience
5365541 but once they start they basically learn at the same rate
5365542 older kids may do better at first but theres a tradeoff
5365543 theyre also a year in school behind other kids their own age at the end of the line somehow that year will catch up to them they start work a year later and parents have an extra year of child care costs if they delay entry so its not free
5365544 what we think is going on is that teachers are comparing younger kids to older classmates and the younger kids tend to stand out
5365545 they stand out either as not doing as well or they tend to stand out as being more hyperactive
5365546 older kids do better at first and younger kids do worse but they catch up
5365547 the thing is schools are making profound decisions based on these differences differences that tend to fade away
5365548 its clear the pattern is these academic differences get smaller as kids get older
5365549 it doesnt seem reasonable to us that there could be large long term gains from starting kindergarten at an older age when there isnt much of an effect for kids in eighth grade
5365550 whether they go to school earlier or later thats really not going to matter much at the end of the day
5365551 i had this puppy i had when i was a kid in cincinnati and this puppy was really sick and i took it to the vet but they wouldnt admit him because you know i was a kid and i had no money and this puppy died right there in the lobby and i always felt that something like that happened to james brown that loss is unspeakable and he just didnt want to be attached to anyone
5365552 i aint your mama i dont even know you like that
5365553 mr kalfas we have emergency services en route just hang in there

5365558 for my attorney general campaign account which is consistent with a run for governor its not inconsistent
5365559 i know how to bring people to the table and solve problems
5365560 in order to get elected you need to hold statewide office
5365561 the state is so huge and running in southern california and all those cities down there if you are just a mayor either in san francisco or even in los angeles you have a small base

5365569 a lot of people have given me tips on bristol
5365570 mike and johnny have probably run there more than anyone in the series so they know the track
5365571 we want to take fan involvement to the next level to control the consumer experience too
5365572 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news
5365573 power and money in the democratic party is being centralized around a key iconic figure obama is consolidating power within the party
5365574 i was the polling adviser for the democratic leadership council back then
5365575 clintons candidacy and that effort was very much focused on addressing the historical problems of the democratic party
5365576 clinton became very identified with the presidential wing of the party
5365577 but there was a lot of resentment from the daschle and gephardt people to the way they were treated by the clinton people i think the people who acted in clintons name didnt generate an awful lot of goodwill for them
5365578 thats incredible the guys been there for three fucking years
5365579 all the candidates lined up within 20 yards of each other on virtually every question that is an important interesting change that shouldnt be overlooked in the democratic party
5365580 fundraising was a zero sum game for a significant part of the democratic partys recent history
5365581 clinton viewed the dnc and the party in general as a vehicle for fundraising and media
5365582 when you were raising your money mostly through large donors and pacs there was a continual sense that there was a limited amount of money that could be raised and if you spent it now you couldnt spend it later
5365583 now theres a totally different view of money the more you spend the more you raise
5365584 we benefited from the thing people complained about which was that kerry was hardcore about targeting
5365585 if you were targeted you got everything you needed and if you werent you got nothing people who werent targeted were pretty bitter being told that if they wanted buttons they had to go to the kerry web site and buy them
5365586 as good as it was for colorado it wasnt a sustainable model
5365587 i am proud of the fact that were the first campaign in a generation to run a 50 state strategy
5365588 not a 50 percent plus one strategy but a 50 state strategy made possible by the volunteer activism and organizing you and others have made on the ground and support by governor deans efforts at the dnc
5365589 which is not only win but leave something behind so we can begin to turn south carolina blue in the years to come
5365590 the 50 state strategy is certainly not the unanimous strategy
5365591 if obama were to lose those folks would come out of the woodwork
5365592 there are a lot of people in this congress who are heavily invested in the status quo
5365593 obama has got to guide congress to get the results that he wants its a tough relationship
5365594 is not what happens if obama loses or if he wins and continues to build but if he gets there and leaves out his grass roots
5365595 were building lasting infrastructure which will not only help us win in november but build the progressive movement for years to come
5365596 our 50 state strategy isnt just about winning the presidential election but lifting democrats up and down the ticket we have a historic opportunity to elect more democrats at every level from city councils to state legislatures to the united states congress and thats how were going to bring about a working democratic majority and thats how were going to see real change in america
5365597 i think the american people are hungry for something different and can be mobilized around big changes not incremental changes not small changes
5365598 i think that there are a whole host of republicans and certainly independents who have lost trust in their government who dont believe anybody is listening to them who are staggering under rising costs of health care college education who dont believe what politicians say and we can draw those independents and some republicans into a working coalition a working majority for change
5365599 the big western debate is whether this is about georgia or russia
5365600 those who want to contain the damage say that georgia is a little country partly to blame and not worth the confrontation with moscow then there are those who say this is really about russia and the rules of the game for europe writ large for the caspian energy corridor and the right of small countries to choose their own path
5365601 how do they square their increasing energy dependence on russia with their increasing political discomfort with putin its a very hard circle to square
5365602 will only be reinforced in its view that georgia and ukraine are not ready for nato
5365603 there is little disagreement now in europe about the nature of the new russia
5365604 europe is torn between old and new europe but i dont see europe prepared to go to war with itself over georgia the european foreign ministers sense this is too big for them and they will in the end align themselves with the united states while trying to affect policy
5365605 nato never developed military plans to defend central and eastern europeans because we said russias not an enemy and not a threat and we never backed up the new members with exercises and infrastructure
5365606 russia has never been a nation state but always an empire with moskovy gradually expanding its borders since the 15th century
5365607 russia built a state as it built its empire the two were inseparable
5365608 and we in the west never fully measured the effect of this loss of empire on the russians or how integral ukraine is to the russian sense of self
5365609 the russian conclusion then and its widely shared there is that the limit has been reached no more concessions a push for rollback and definitely no georgia and no ukraine in nato
5365610 russias reputation as a potential partner in international institutions diplomatic political security economic is frankly in tatters
5365611 russia will pay a price we will look seriously with our allies and bilaterally at the consequences of this russian action georgia will rebuild russias reputation may not be rebuilt
5365612 she has been the dominant voice in the entire bush second term on any issue of importance and i dont know why that differ now unless the president seizes the reins but i dont see any evidence of that happening
5365613 they will be dressed in russian military uniform and let go in gori where these bands will loot and pillage the local residents
5365614 this will be filmed by television cameras and then presented to the world as an atrocity of the russian war machine
5365615 in december we will have a first evaluation of the situation and we are on a clear path in the direction of nato membership
5365616 the united states is not going to go to war with russia over the borders of south ossetia and so the tools available to us are largely diplomatic for all those critics who claim the administration has not relied sufficiently on diplomacy this is what it looks like when there are few good military options and one has to rely primarily on diplomacy
5365617 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to
5365618 the security zone is temporary this is not disputed by any of the parties
5365619 it is more important that foreign observers arrive so it is not only troops of the russian dominated commonwealth of independent states in georgia
5365620 es gibt keine friedliche l sung ohne russland diesen gro en nachbarn der europ ischen union

5365625 we remain cautious on dramatic ssd encroachment in computing devices through 2009 excluding notebooks due to cost performance and reliability durability
5365626 but enterprise storage product development has occurred slightly faster than originally expected
5365627 ssds excel in random read and access times up to 50 percent faster and in some cases power consumption alternatively ssd write times are up to 40 percent slower
5365628 overall a less decisive tilt toward nand than many would have expected a year ago
5365629 more recently we have taken greater notice of ssds early traction in the opposite end of the market high end enterprise arrays
5365630 the impact of the ssd incursion into the enterprise will be concentrated in the high end of the market where fibre channel disk drives have come to dominate
5365631 there will also likely be an opportunity for displacement in high end server based storage
5365632 inclusive of both host and server based storage opportunities we estimate a plausible 70 000 tbyte ssd market in 2007 growing to roughly 118 000 tbytes by 2009
5365633 these four young people did a great job theyre heroes for what theyve done
5365634 i like it the job a lot i really do
5365635 being a lifeguard is more that a summer job its a commitment of service to others
5365636 the type of person youd want for a son hes all about service
5365637 these four stepped up and did the job theyre trained to do
5365638 this working at the beach was kind of my last hurrah now ill be looking for a full time job
5365639 long term effects from things like pesticides chemicals gmo hormones in meat and dairy products and the lingering worries about the impact of mad cow disease on the meat supply
5365640 not everyone loves social media and marketing as much as you shane
5365641 i never seen you like this before i feel like whacking you already
5365642 the last time we held this event was in 2003 and we had such a great response with so many requests to bring it back to the fair that we were finally able to do so this year
5365643 karaoke has been a great addition to the fair for us and a very popular event among fair goers we knew we definitely had to bring it back this year
5365644 the special thing about this fair is that it is an agricultural showcase for the community and an event that families can come out to enjoy a wide spectrum of activities
5365645 there is no way in hell those specs are valid the box is way too small with those drivers
5365646 a 410 is much like someone elses 410 and a three way isnt a two way unless they are different
5365647 they killed 2 000 people georgians were crushing small children with their tanks
5365648 no but i heard putin say it so it must be true
5365649 well i just know that the russian president said several days ago russian military operations would stop they didnt
5365650 this time i hope he means it you know the word of the russian president needs to be upheld by his forces
5365651 the conditions there were far better than that of our fellow jews in other camps nevertheless we harbored no hope knowing that the moment our project was completed they would destroy us made us live in constant fear they wouldnt dare leave us alive
5365652 for years i was silent i didnt want to speak about this anymore
5365653 it was only when the neo nazis started with their lies about auschwitz that i began to travel through germany and give my speeches to tell people what happened
5365654 i remember as a three year old in new york wandering around the house looking for a place to hide from the nazis
5365655 within a month we were forced to wear the yellow star patch and a month later we were corralled into a ghetto by the following month we were already en route to auschwitz
5365656 they separated the men and women and that was the last we ever saw of them we were taken two days later for forced labor in an austrian quarry from which no one returned none of those i knew friends and neighbors who were with us on that transport survived to tell the grisly tale
5365657 at the very last moment before we were all shipped off to that vale of death the germans asked us if there were any professionals among us in any field gardeners and printers were ordered to step forward i have no idea what they did with the gardeners but we were taken to a huge print shop which had been set up in auschwitz we were tested to see if we really knew how to operate the presses
5365658 my grandfather had owned the print shop and knew all about the actual printing process but my father and uncle had only managed the business end as for me i was a student my only acquaintance with the mechanics was from a brief introduction during the vacation break between eleventh and twelfth grades to my relief and luck the german exam was short and superficial and our combined knowledge was enough
5365659 they told us to print up a greeting card not knowing how or where to begin i busied myself cleaning the press on the outside to appear as if i knew what i was doing apparently our supervisors were no great experts either because somehow we passed that test
5365660 the only difference in our mode of travel this time was that we each had a seat the trains were heavily guarded by ss officers but they were a grade higher than the previous human cattle cars
5365661 sachsenhausen boasted 8 000 victims because of its proximity to berlin today israeli heads of state and officials are taken there for guided tours we were housed in barracks 18 and 19 in a special barbed wire area totally isolated from the rest of the prisoners
5365662 they treated us fairly decently meanwhile we slept on beds rather than on bunk boards and got relatively good food though by the end of the war i still weighed less than 95 lbs so it was no hotel if someone got sick he was removed supposedly to the infirmary or hospital but we knew that he was permanently eliminated the nazis couldnt afford to risk any information leaking out
5365663 we knew that death was only a question of time
5365664 this forged bill was accepted by the bank of england itself
5365665 they had a serious technical problem with the dollar however today the problem could be solved with sophisiticated computer technology but then it was insurmountable
5365666 in an attempt to make a breakthrough the nazis brought a forger and swindler to our camp a russian jew named salomon smolianoff but he was equally at a loss to solve their problem
5365667 i believe there was some sabotage too on the part of the printers being the youngest i was left out of most of the intrigue but i do believe that one of our group supervised our work and made sure that we werent too efficient so that they would no longer need us or too inefficient in which case they would also get rid of us today the world talks about us in idealistic terms depicting us as determined to sabotage the nazi war effort i personally did not encounter that we were all there with one purpose in mind to survive
5365668 the film director wanted to make the conflict of conscience one of the central themes
5365669 this was good for the film but i know it wasnt an issue with my father
5365670 at this stage even we knew that they were losing that it was only a matter of time before the allies took over we were worried whether they would decide to liquidate us before that happened it was known that the greater their losses at the front the more jews the nazis destroyed with a demonic vengeance
5365671 they loaded us on open train cars together with all the machinery without telling us where we were headed so long as we remained together with the crates and machines we felt safe and optimistic when we got close to the camp this optimism disappeared since we knew that this was no labor camp it contained the gas chambers meant for annihilation
5365672 we finally arrived at ebensee but the jews who had already seized control there wouldnt let us in we looked too good to them too well fed too clean they refused to believe we were jews after two days the allies came to liberate us and the rest of the 16 000 jewish prisoners in the camp
5365673 burger also organized a search party of divers which found among other things a chest containing a list with the names of the 143 jews who worked on the counterfeiting project the name sonnenfeld appears three times mine my fathers and my uncles
5365674 i was the youngest there now im 82 soon no one will be left to tell the tale
5365675 hes been very truthful and to me thats the only way you can find common ground
5365676 we have probably failed to understand that the russians are really quite serious when they say we have interests and were going to defend them
5365677 russia does have interests and at some point theyre going to stand up and draw lines that are not simply to be ignored
5365678 we were training saakashvilis army and he was getting at least a corps of highly trained individuals which he could use for adventures
5365679 the feeling in the intelligence community was that this was a very high risk endeavor
5365680 but it was a little bit of the price we were willing to pay for the military cooperation in iraq
5365681 i go back to the democracy thing im not saying i gave them a big pass here but looking back i should have pressed harder
5365682 the claim that this process is not directed against russia will not suffice
5365683 it definitely wasnt what i would call a look into your eyes and see your soul meeting
5365684 we must not allow russia to believe it has a free hand to engage in policies that undermine georgian sovereignty
5365685 theres no doubt that the georgians have carefully cultivated a broad base of support in washington
5365686 its possible that georgians may have confused the cheerleading from washington with something else
5365687 so are you going i understood you are going to give a tough fight for us in december
5365688 from our positions in these enclaves we can sever those pipelines whenever we want
5365689 you can build pipelines through georgia but we can snap them whenever we want
5365690 dont think that you could build more pipelines through georgia and theyll be safe theyll never be safe
5365691 your ideas about nabucco are futile because we can smash the nabucco system anytime we want
5365692 we have to do this because we need the us support against russia
5365693 the entire route of the btc the only major oil pipeline from the caspian region outside of russias control should now be treated as high risk and turkeys viability as an energy bridge to europe has been thrown into question
5365694 russia has a very clear strategy and would prefer europes gas to go via russia and not via independent countries there is no definite attempt by russia to disrupt supplies but it is not unhelpful to russia that there is unrest
5365695 could render further foreign investment in any oil and gas transport links that bypass russia too risky

5365717 well were gonna turn the civic center into a honky tonk thats pretty much what we do you know we have a great honky tonk band with fiddle and steel and all that
5365718 were going to be doing as many of our old songs as we can and plus weve got the new cd out and were going to be doing some new songs from that
5365719 it took me a little over two years to finish this album and i think that this is probably the best one ive ever done mainly for the fact of the quality of the songs
5365720 i had more time to choose songs to write songs and then we had more time in the studio to lay them down
5365721 once that single was out and working its way up the charts we were looking for songs and recording
5365722 these days singles can have a life span on the radio of about six months so we took advantage of that to get the album just right
5365723 were real excited about playing the show in bay city because we dont get to play texas enough
5365724 for the last three or four years weve gone to europe every year to do some tours and last summer we were in japan doing tours for a couple of weeks but this year were staying here at home trying to get this cd off the ground
5365725 its the song that started my career its a classic country song and its still my favorite one to do
5365726 if it hadnt been for that one song i dont know if i would have had a career
5365727 ill be going home after that concert and doing some fishing on the upper texas coast i havent been fishing in over two months so im a little depressed about that because thats my thing man fishing on the bays
5365728 weve been working so much im just ready to get the kids back in school
5365729 i havent had a chance to take them fishing either but theyre more interested in playing guitar anyway
5365730 the last couple of summers i would take one of them out at a time and let them come out on the road with me for two or three days on a short run but i learned real quick that was a mistake
5365731 young boys theyre out there on the bus and having a good time seeing us playing music and having a good time and next thing you know theyre talking about thats what theyre going to do for a living but i want them to get an education
5365732 they can mess with music as a hobby but theyve got to get an education
5365733 when i quit school when i was a junior in high school i was extremely lucky that i got a career going and that i was successful
5365734 they dont really understand the struggle they dont really understand the financial stress were under constantly
5365735 you cant quit school and be a successful anything anymore even in music
5365736 the main thing is i want fans to go out and get that new cd thats in the stores right now
5365737 but if the fans want that cd and they cant find it in the store tell them to talk to the manager tell the store or department manager to get that cd and they will get it
5365738 i usually dont have time to do autograph signings at the show but i do sit on the bus and i sign hundreds of cds
5365739 i sit there and take them out of the plastic and everything else and sign them
5365740 im pleased to report the city got an unqualified opinion
5365741 the operation is running on all eight cylinders were getting information quicker of that were quite thankful and hopeful
5365742 i guarantee you wont see any after that date june 30 2008
5365743 it was more of a logistical problem than a financial one
5365744 the lateness of the 2006 2007 report was not attributable to them
5365745 on behalf of our 600 chamber members and staff i want to welcome you to this lunch and thank you for everything that you do for our youth and the success of our youth
5365746 i just wanted to briefly touch on a couple of items one of them is of significant importance to bay city and matagorda county as im sure all of you have seen over the last couple of years the economic growth in the city and the county
5365747 over the next five to 10 years there will be a real need for over 2 000 well educated well trained folks here in bay city to meet the needs of that growth and fill that workforce
5365748 that is a partnership of industry the independent school districts and the junior college and you can help by educating the kids in the classroom and motivating them to be a part of that program and to be a part of the future of matagorda county
5365749 i dont think she could have been successful without the support of the experienced teachers here at the school district the staff and administration
5365750 i know that support will be here for you and i encourage you to take advantage of that and im sure youll be successful
5365751 i know your job is demanding tiring frustrating but at the same time i also challenge you to be a part of this community because volunteers like you make this community what it is
5365752 so this year in addition to your busy day take a few moments become a member of the chamber become active in your church and theres plenty of other organizations in town like the united way red cross they are all looking for great volunteers
5365753 you have a great challenge and a great opportunity so i want to wish you the very best
5365754 over a dozen area churches will be working together to make the school supply give away our main focus
5365755 we set the goal at 500 and we usually reach our goal
5365756 this year we are simplifying and trying to make the focus the school supply give away
5365757 its all different churches working together for the cause of christ to serve the community
5365758 we estimate shoppers will save about 54 million in sales tax during the sales tax holiday including approximately 42 1 million in state sales tax and 11 9 million in local sales taxes
5365759 we are still very early in the planning stages so we havent nailed down our silent and live auction items yet but we can always count on getting some great donations for those items
5365760 tetts jewelers has always been dedicated and committed to the local schools civic organizations and service organizations
5365761 it is fitting that the city of bay city recognize and congratulate tetts jewelers on this important milestone
5365762 tetts jewelers has also employed many local citizens and has played a major role in improving the economy of our community
5365763 kenleigh is growing up in this shop just like i did
5365764 she even plays with some of the exact same baby toys that i played with when i was being raised here
5365765 many of you have heard all of the bad news in the press lately about housing and wed like to try to give you some good news today
5365766 we each have a responsibility for ourselves our families and our communities therefore we need to live united
5365767 we want to continuously do that not just when we have a natural disaster or when we need to all come together it should be everyday living
5365768 its easy to just call attention to and rally against todays social and economic injustices however you must also be a part of a solution
5365769 these are big issues that arent out of reach what can i do to help a single mom on public assistance what can i do to combat the spread of aids in africa what can i do to end homelessness in our streets
5365770 these issues impact all of us and we can all do something about them
5365771 we can give of our time we advocate for our children and our neighborhoods we can volunteer to make a difference in the lives of others
5365772 weve also seen an increased number of stolen license plates so that if a gas station attendant copies down the license plate number it cant be traced back to the proper owner of the vehicle
5365773 these store owners are the ones losing money from all of these drive offs but they are hesitant to require their customers to pay first because they focus on customer service and they dont want to inconvenience their patrons
5365774 we are hoping this will really help to reduce the fuel theft instances
5365775 i think we will stick with two strikers you dont play chelsea every week
5365776 i could have stuck with our system from last season it worked a treat for us but if id have done that i would have had to leave defoe out of the team
5365777 i brought him here to play and it would have meant leaving him out for the first game of the season

5365794 if you have an inquiry you can tailor it individually
5365795 this is a planning took where all things are going
5365796 hardly any of the locals left but i would say that most tourists pretty well did leave what few there were that stayed over the weekend
5365797 we did see some removal of boats and travel trailers and a few people who live right on the beach did board up but not many
5365798 we had four camper trailers that people brought in to keep inside the fairground facilities
5365799 we offer that as a secure area that is fenced in and patrolled by sheriff deputies in case people need to go out of town and want to leave their belongings
5365800 both ervs arrived home monday night in case they were needed here but since we got nothing im sure they will be dispatched further east to respond to any potential needs in southeast texas

5365802 developers may not have loved the system in the past but they are flocking to it with support now
5365803 its not going to happen if youre coming for that youll be disappointed
5365804 if you can imagine if movies competed in this way well sure schindlers list was good but i know this three and a half hour long movie think of the value youre getting for your ten dollars it doesnt work that way and unfortunately we still find ourselves competing this way we have to compete in quality not size
5365805 is a song based on a character from one of pablo martinezs dreams
5365806 its almost as if they decided to save the best for last their piece de resistance the show closer as it were its just a bloody good track what else can i say
5365807 if only because of its attempt to be a little different
5365808 the bonus track at the end of the album is an acoustic track that i found to be very likable because of its hint of latin flair and female vocalism
5365809 maybe that thunderstorm will come and this will be cancelled

5365817 im just happy my first throw was the gold medal throw brown trafton said
5365818 its an awesome feeling i knew i was going to medal then i won the gold medal
5365819 there are excellent throwers here who have been to tons more olympics than i have i dont have as much experience as they do its an awesome feeling to have the peace of mind to come back with the gold medal
5365820 i really hope it will set a precedent for the u
5365821 we need as many gold medals as we can get i was shocked when someone told me it was the first gold medal in track and field for the usa i hope its not the last it better not be the last
5365822 when i went out there i wondered who is this woman running around with the flag
5365823 its an honor to be mentioned in the same breath as edwin moses taylor said

5365831 we welcome ea into our formal process and look forward to demonstrating to their board the significant strides made by take two since they last undertook a detailed review of our business in early 2007 our board remains unwavering in its belief that eas unsolicited conditional tender offer of 25 74 per share was inadequate and undervalued world class entertainment franchises and our strong operational and financial performance
5365832 we are continuing to consider all alternatives that will maximize value to our stockholders as part of that commitment we are engaged in discussions with other parties as part of a formal process to generate greater value and will act quickly to assist ea in moving expeditiously through our process in the meantime we remain focused on executing on our business goals and creating value for stockholders and consumers of our products

5365841 the work on these began long long ago with owners who took care of these properties through the years
5365842 i would like to recognize and thank each property owner or representative for their commitment in carrying and preserving history
5365843 i would also like to give a big thank you to matagorda county judge and commissioners court for supporting certified local governments commitment to preservation
5365844 each of you should be proud of your part in this hard work of getting these historic places recognized nationally
5365845 its quite a feather in matagorda countys cap to have 10 places on the national register and more to come
5365846 weve been talking about going up on the rent at the fairgrounds since i got elected
5365847 i feel like this is a fair increase and i dont think were gouging people
5365848 this is just a normal business function that is needed because of the natural cost increase on building maintenance and utility costs
5365849 these rates are way cheaper than other people who even charge 8 10 per hour just to run the air conditioner
5365850 the fairgrounds will still be the cheapest rental rates in bay city
5365851 the fairgrounds are showing some age and wear and we need to look at improving them and this is one way we can begin to fund that
5365852 we plan to use the money to purchase a new handheld radar for speed detection
5365853 we had one that we used in a sting for school zones
5365854 hopefully well have the new one by the time school starts again
5365855 he then moved to a profession where he would need to learn many skills
5365856 our honoree mastered many skills all of these skills propelled him to the top of his profession including leadership communication negotiation and patience
5365857 in fact this very corporation was once a committee of the chamber of commerce
5365858 his vision of our county led to his running for mayor and his tenure as mayor has been phenomenal
5365859 its indeed an honor and a privilege to receive this honor from mitch who we all know succeeded me at the chamber and i wanted to say thank you to everybody
5365860 you know a lot of folks have done a lot of great things over the years to bring us to where we are today and this is a combination of that so thank you
5365861 i think what we can see as we look around tonight is a county that is in transition in change
5365862 i think we are entering a period now where the change and transition is becoming much more apparent
5365863 all of those things are coming together and they are having an impact on economic development
5365864 we have to refocus our economic development strategy to promote not just growth but a better quality of life for our citizens
5365865 with the many new citizens we expect to be moving into the county we need a housing stock that will accommodate variety
5365866 we need to keep our people and our industry here in the county and having a way to train them locally for a good career is one way we do that
5365867 we continue to look for companies that are going to upgrade the wage scales locally
5365868 accountability ratings provide parents and community members with a standardized way to examine academic performance at their local schools
5365869 the ratings help texans highlight successes and pinpoint areas that need improvement
5365870 these schools and districts are top performers they are great role models for the rest of our schools i applaud these schools and districts for their outstanding success
5365871 it is always difficult to impose strong sanctions against a school but we cannot allow students to languish in consistently low performing schools
5365872 water arouses passions because it can be used as a weapon a political weapon just as oil is a political weapon
5365873 its incomprehensible that in one country there is an excess of water in one place and a deficit in another
5365874 even more incomprehensible is that they expect us to use water from desalination plants which is expensive and would force us to raise prices
5365875 in this plant alone we are talking about solar energy providing about one million kilowatt hours kwh a year against the total consumption of 180 million kwh ie less than 0
5365876 you must not leave the tap on for too long because water will be wasted and we wont have enough water in barcelona
5365877 if you want to shower in hot water then you must collect the cold water that comes out first in a bucket and use it later to water the plants
5365878 if you dont have water there are lots of things you cant do you cant live without it without water we cant survive
5365879 this web show has the weight of the traditional media world on its shoulders
5365880 it was his horse and it was a good horse and he rode the horse when it was night he hobbled the horse by a stream and both boy and horse drank from the cold water of the stream
5365881 he impressed me and because he did this it inspired me to become a doctor
5365882 i did not have any idea that i was going to be honored
5365883 i think one of the best parts of being a doctor is receiving nice letters from my patients
5365884 whenever i have a bad day and i receive a letter from one of my patients it always helps me and makes me feel better about my day
5365885 the hours are hard and it is definitely hard work
5365886 its an interesting attack but doesnt seem to be very widespread at the moment
5365887 our work would be so much easier if our enemy would be stupid

5365890 no system is equipped to deal with such intense rainfall which means that systems have become overwhelmed in some areas
5365891 staff and contractors from all three drainage agencies rivers agency roads service and ni water are working with the fire and rescue service and are responding to all reported incidents as soon as possible
5365892 however resources have been overwhelmed due to the scale of this event all our sympathies are with any residents affected in what is clearly a distressing experience for everyone
5365893 like web oriented news consumers integrators are affluent and highly educated however they are older on average than those who consider the internet their main source of news

5365920 i felt upset and angry with the onslaught against innocent women and children in countries such as
5365921 deep commitment to and involvement in violent jihad by promoting it inciting others to take part in it and arranging for himself and others to attend military training in pakistan in preparation for going to fight and inevitably to kill
5365922 assassinating named personnel and foreign tourists and freeing captured brothers from the enemy
5365923 those who dwell as scientists or laymen among the beauties and mysteries of the earth are never alone or weary of life
5365924 when looking at the evidence against hammaad munshi i was satisfied there was enough for a case to go to court and that it was in the public interest despite his young age
5365925 the prosecution told the jury of his dedication to the cause of al qaeda and of discussions with aabid khan which included how he could travel abroad and smuggle a sword with him
5365926 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5365927 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5365928 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5365929 christ has no body now on earth but yours no hands but yours no feet but yours yours are the eyes through which christs compassion is to look out to the earth yours are the feet by which he is to go about doing good and yours are the hands by which he is to bless us now
5365930 from the moment i landed until i left the city impressed me everywhere i met only kindness i was in a shopping centre and asked a young girl the way to the mrt mass rapid transit station she offered to show me the way and taking my shopping bags led me to the station shopkeepers gave me water to drink people waiting for a bus walked with me to the correct bus stop and people helped me cross the street i have never experienced this sort of kindness anywhere else in the world
5365931 actually we should feel quite embarrassed to leave our dirty plates and dirty tables for the next diner in my mums house after eating we will clear our plates and clean the table this is a good habit we should adopt outside the home

5365969 many of the institutions weve been talking with have been counting on some flexibility in the degree to which they comply with the deadline
5365970 based on the ots examination procedures november 1 means november 1
5365971 the ots procedures reinforce exactly what weve been discussing with institutions since the red flag guidelines were announced
5365972 the announcement makes it clear that they want a consistent and deliberate approach to dealing with address changes one that can be sampled the easiest and surest way to get there is to use technology and automation to your advantage

5365976 however according to our march 2008 survey of 50 u s banks these measures are already being circumvented by thieves using phishing and malware based intrusion attacks against end users including cross channel fraud schemes that typically involve online banking account takeover financial institutions should consider using the upcoming red flag regulation deadline as an opportunity to improve suboptimal fraud prevention processes cross account cross channel and cross institution
5365977 fraudsters continually demonstrate their ability to compromise traditional approaches to protecting online accounts with a recent example being the coreflood trojan this scheme steals and validates online banking credentials despite the strong authentication and basic fraud detection methods institutions have implemented

5365999 one the basis of d the current empirical research alone there is thus no solid foundation for concluding that children even young children will be typically better off if placed with their primary caretaker
5366000 research on the ties of children to secondary caretakers makes clear that such ties are typically stronger than once believed but leaves open the significant possibility that preserving the intimate interaction of the child with the primary caretaker is of greater importance to the child
5366001 m y earlier review suggests the probability that primary caretakers will suffer more emotionally than secondary caretakers when shifted into a mere visitors role
5366002 a primary caretaker preference will reduce the incidence of litigation by letting one side know it is less likely to win whoever bears the burden of proof will be denied custody in those cases probably substantial in number in which the judge concludes at the end of all the evidence that she has no strong basis for believing that the children will do better in one setting than the other

5366105 id like to see it go down to two dollars but thats not going to happen anytime soon
5366106 the only way you get things accomplished is to do so in a bipartisan way because you have to have 60 votes and i did reach out to democrats to see if we couldnt find some common ground
5366107 weve seen prices start falling weve seen the price for a barrel of oil decrease by about 20 percent since the president made his statement since we came out with our proposal
5366108 i think thats great he should just continue to go forward with it and hopefully make progress with it and bring the prices on down
5366109 its unfortunate that the democratic majority found a way to extend authorization for the federal aviation administration but given the chance to extend the current medicare fee levels they objected twice
5366110 doctors and seniors deserve a serious and responsible effort that addresses the impending fee cut without playing politics and creating a major expansion of entitlement spending i will continue to work to provide doctors the relief they deserve and seniors the benefits they deserve
5366111 i am very pleased the administration is giving congress more time to work out reasonable legislation to eliminate this 10 percent cut in medicare payments to doctors i will do everything i can to see to it that the senate quickly passes a bill that helps georgia doctors and that helps georgia medicare beneficiaries especially our seniors and those who live in rural areas
5366112 senator chambliss im fed up with congress ignoring the will of the american people stop playing politics and act on the will of the people weve been demanding that you drill and use our 3 trillion barrels of oil we need other resource avenues that the last three administrations havent addressed stop the partisan politics and pass the will of the people the american people do not want a socialistic society period fix the problem
5366113 senator chambliss please do something about the gas prices im a stay at home mom and with raising the family on one income the price of gas is cutting us short on our needs something needs to be done soon were having to cut corners on a lot of different places in order to afford gas to and from work everything is increasing except wages we both have a college education and drive fuel efficient cars but the money we bring in just isnt stretching far enough
5366114 when congress tackles issues of such complexity we must make certain that we do not ignore the potential unintended consequences that i believe will result from this approach
5366115 we simply have not had the opportunity to fully explore the possibility that implementation of this legislation could have negative impacts such as driving the price of crude oil up further the real issue is that factual data is lacking in this debate which unfortunately allows everyone to paint the picture convenient for their cause
5366116 i am not opposed to all aspects of this bill rather i believe many of the components designed to yield more transparency in these markets are necessary
5366117 we must ensure that the information both the regulators and congress use to ensure proper oversight is accurate to warrant our actions but this language goes far beyond what i consider reasonable a reasonable market oversight component could be developed as part of a bipartisan comprehensive package but unfortunately this approach is only distracting us from developing more reasonable and balanced legislation
5366118 this critical legislation has been the subject of many negotiations and although the legislation is not perfect i am pleased with the bipartisan nature of this compromise bill
5366119 our veterans deserve access to the very best medical care and services
5366120 the announcement of these new clinics is great news for veterans in our state who have served our nation with honor
5366121 this is outstanding news that georgia will receive four new va clinics to deliver to our veterans the level of va care they deserve
5366122 as a member of the senate committee on veterans affairs one of my top priorities is to make sure america takes care of the veterans who have dedicated their lives to serving our country
5366123 social security is and has always been an important program and many seniors in georgia and across the nation depend on this vital program
5366124 currently nearly 48 million americans are receiving some form of social security benefit we must ensure that this program continues to provide benefits to the working americans that deserve what they have earned today americans have been using this program to aid in their retirement for 73 years many have benefited and it is my goal that many will continue to have access to this program as we in congress work to ensure that it remains solvent i would like to take this opportunity to renew our commitment to making sure this program is around for many years to come

5366136 your board recommend that the holders reject the offer after taking into consideration the current and future prospects of the ppb groups performance
5366137 based on these your board is of the view that the future prospects of ppb are favourable in view of the strong growth potential
5366138 as such your board wishes to reiterate that it does not concur with the recommendation of rhb investment
5366139 the intention is for uem land to expand and diversify beyond just nusajaya it may also include the option of acquiring new landbank in other parts of the country or even overseas
5366140 this is in the process of business development and evaluation but whether or not we enter into a deal depends on the economics of it and whether or not it fits into uem lands strategy
5366141 the construction continues as we speak so far at uem group bhd there has not been any formal instruction to do otherwise
5366142 the intention is for uem land to expand and diversify beyond just nusajaya it may also include the option of acquiring new landbank in other parts of the country or even overseas

5366145 as for the second half of this year its going to be very tough and only the fittest carriers will survive this onslaught
5366146 we managed to reduce non fuel expenditure by 13 per cent although it was not enough to mitigate the fuel increase of 56 per cent
5366147 we spent an additional rm808 million in fuel as the price increased from us 85 rm284 per barrel to us 150 rm501 per barrel but we used gains from our hedging and forex foreign exchange amounting to rm185 million to mitigate the fuel increase
5366148 if we dont solve the problem we will be paying 6 to 8 per gallon for gasoline
5366149 and it is only 72 miles from the existing alaskan pipeline

5366152 i believe this effort epitomizes what the united states senate is all about
5366153 nothing gets done in this body without 60 votes and you dont get 60 votes without a true bipartisan effort this has been a cooperative effort on the part of all of 10 members this has not been easy and it has been very difficult at times but the discussion has always taken place in a very professional way even though sometimes its been in a very direct way it is my hope that when we return from the august recess our colleagues in the senate after having just spent time at home with their constituents will come forward to support this effort
5366154 ive said for weeks that america has within its reach every resource necessary to be self sufficient when it comes to energy we just need the political will and the common sense to make it happen
5366155 well when good people sit down with good intentions they come up with good ideas there is no silver bullet when it comes to reducing the cost of energy but senators chambliss and conrad have done an outstanding job leading this group to a number of solutions that i believe can work together to alleviate this crisis
5366156 im pleased this bill supports our men and women in uniform who are deployed in defense of freedom and gives them the resources they deserve and need to accomplish their mission
5366157 our servicemen and women make sacrifices every day so that we can live in the safest most secure nation in the world
5366158 im pleased we were able to provide this funding so that all of our soldiers have the resources and tools they need to complete their missions
5366159 the montgomery g i bill can change lives it has given countless members of our military access to the college education they otherwise would not have been able to afford
5366160 our nations military and their families have sacrificed tremendously so that our nation can live in freedom it is important we modernize education benefits for our military to ensure that our servicemembers veterans and members of the national guard and reserve receive the education benefits they deserve
5366161 this legislation will greatly expand educational benefits available to servicemembers
5366162 i am pleased to announce this funding for the university of georgia
5366163 with the increased development of cellulosic biofuels we are getting one step closer to gaining energy independence from foreign sources for oil this announcement is also a great boost for georgia as a leader in the development of alternative fuels i thank the doe and the usda for recognizing the tremendous potential of cellulosic biofuels to produce clean and efficient fuel
5366164 i believe we must take significant steps to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and one of the best long term solutions is the investment we are making in the production of cellulosic biofuels
5366165 georgia has 24 million acres of commercial forest and these forests contain tons of cellulosic biomass in the form of wood debris paper pulp and grass fuel this is exceptional news for the university of georgia and for the entire state
5366166 its not just what 10 of us think we can do its also whats going to be possible with the white house and or with the leadership
5366167 it may be minimal but thats ok if it is
5366168 kent we agreed on so much on the farm bill and i gotta believe that there is a lot we agree on energy
5366169 and we started talking about it and there is theres an awful lot and we agreed that there are a lot of democrats and republicans that think like we did
5366170 hopefully we can work something out on a bipartisan basis i will certainly try
5366171 instead of proposing legislation which will just add more to the 68 million unused acres i think we should try something that might be a little better than that
5366172 was to narrowly craft something that could make a difference and appeal to democrats
5366173 who are open to doing something on the production side
5366174 it depends on whether youre interested in leading or whether youre interested in the politics of the issue
5366175 weve had solutions out there that have been blocked by republicans
5366176 the reality is the reality their obstinance and intransigence is going to cost them
5366177 i am disappointed in the supreme courts ruling yesterday that the crime of child rape cannot be punishable by death because it violates the eighth amendments prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment the rape of a child is one of the most heinous crimes that can be committed and i think every georgian agrees law enforcement should be able to punish heinous criminals who commit this act and states should be able to determine the circumstances under which the death penalty should be applicable the state of georgia has a law on the books today that makes child rape a capital offense when aggravating circumstances are present including but not limited to a prior conviction i am pleased that justice kennedy indicated in his ruling that georgias law permitting execution for child rape is still in effect as a father and grandfather it frankly makes me sick to think the court would have such poor judgment

5366187 i applaud the presidents announcement today and i am hopeful it will put even more pressure on congress to address the current energy crisis the presidents move is an important step in signaling to the world community that the united states is indeed serious about energy independence make no mistake however congress ultimately has to take action too if the congressional ban is to be lifted so that production along the outer continental shelf can take place georgians continue to tell me that their family budgets are being squeezed due to the price of gasoline and they are rightly furious with the lack of leadership in washington an overwhelming majority of americans support drilling here at home and it is time to put the wheels in motion simply put georgians want us out of this mess and it is my hope that our bipartisan group will be successful in crafting meaningful legislation that both parties can support
5366188 this is not an overly ambitious proposal and does not go as far as i would like to see it go if there is a vote for anwr it wont get the votes to pass but ill vote for it
5366189 our compromise is the only possible bill that might get passed
5366190 senator john mccain had an issue the republicans could embarrass democratic presidential candidate barack obama with and perhaps ride to victory because the mass majority of the american people want to do the opposite of what the democrats do so nobody can figure out why compromise with the democrats and cut the knees off of senator mccain
5366191 we didnt get sent to washington to create political issues we were sent to washington to solve problems
5366192 if we solve problems they political pundits dont have a controversy to focus on
5366193 the rising cost of energy is the number one issue i am hearing about from georgians and the effect these costs are having on family budgets is very real and very urgent
5366194 this is a complex issue but we cannot shy away from action we should not play politics with such an urgent crisis we must come together to act now that is what georgians want and it is what we as policymakers want
5366195 our country is in serious danger because of skyrocketing energy costs this growing crisis demands urgent action
5366196 no single political party can solve our energy crisis the time for delay is over we need to work together to face our energy challenges head on and secure a more energy independent future
5366197 for too long congress has let partisan politics block good energy policies
5366198 it is time for congress to put these differences aside find real solutions and put america back on a path toward energy independence i join my colleagues in calling for an emergency energy summit so we can begin to turn this energy crisis around
5366199 todays high gas prices illustrate that our dependence on foreign sources of energy endangers both our homeland security and our economy
5366200 congress must come together move past endless partisan posturing and take action but action must be rooted in knowledge and far too many come to the debate listing only to interest groups that feed a political agenda a bipartisan commitment informed by balanced expertise will allow congress to move forward with commonsense energy policy that combines increased domestic production with an investment in alternative technologies
5366201 american families are feeling the pain of our growing energy crisis
5366202 gas is at 4 a gallon now is the time to come together to create real solutions that will produce new domestic sources of energy our nation desperately needs to become more energy independent and this summit is a step in the right direction
5366203 without a doubt americans are in desperate need of relief from high energy prices
5366204 nowhere is that felt more than in arkansas and other rural states across the country americas reliance on foreign oil is not a sustainable strategy i believe our country should focus on a long term investment strategy that includes renewable and alternative energy sources which will pave a road to energy independence and we must act now
5366205 there are no quick fixes in dealing with this issue but there are things we can and must do
5366206 with skyrocketing gas prices it is absolutely critical for congress to act now and act boldly holding an energy summit to hear from the experts on energy policy is a positive first step in moving towards a bipartisan solution
5366207 partisan bickering will not lower gas prices or put us on a course toward energy independence
5366208 we need to really sit down and talk about all the options on the table evaluate their merits and move full speed ahead on meaningful reform
5366209 the energy challenges facing our country cannot be solved without bipartisan commitment and cooperation
5366210 i am pleased to be part of an effort to bring together the best ideas of both parties and am anxious to move our country forward with balanced legislation that makes us more secure
5366211 no matter their politics all americans are feeling increasing pain from rising energy costs and we in congress need to start working together now to find solutions to this crisis
5366212 a bipartisan energy summit is a good first step on the road to move us toward more energy security and independence
5366213 i am pleased that the air force has taken this step to provide quick access for subcontractors and other parties affected by these projects
5366214 i will continue to work with the air force to help local subcontractors recover their losses in relation to these projects and will work to ensure that the necessary houses are built and available for the airmen at moody air force base
5366215 the commission has recognized that more information is necessary to ensure that speculation has not become excessive and i agree with them
5366216 the storms and tornadoes that hit southwest georgia last year took a tremendous toll on the americus area and severely displaced a critical medical facility that so many folks in the area rely on it is imperative that the federal government provide all the assistance it can to continue the rebuilding process and ensure that georgians who live in this area have access to the quality health care they deserve
5366217 i saw the absolute devastation of the tragic explosion at the imperial sugar facility firsthand from the start of this investigation it has remained my position that it is congresss job to understand fully the fundamental cause of this disaster so we can help prevent future tragedies
5366218 oshas citation that imperial sugar egregiously and willfully violated safety and health standards is a severe charge we will hold a hearing in the senate next week to get all the facts on the table i look forward to hearing imperial sugar explain its position and to the testimony from all of our witnesses
5366219 these are very serious charges and the families of those whose lives were lost and those who were injured as a result deserve answers
5366220 senator isakson and i requested an investigation into this matter and next weeks hearing is critically important as we move forward in the process of determining why this happened and what measures can be taken to ensure that it doesnt happen again

5366245 a lot of our customers like the ubuntu desktop and use it for software development now they want to roll it out to the server we want to make sure that when they roll out ubuntu on the server they find it equally joyous
5366246 we want to make it as easy to install software on the ubuntu server as it is to for example were getting ready to release db2 and informix database management systems that come as deb packages which will install and do basic set up with only a couple of clicks or a single command line instruction
5366247 when alfresco releases alfresco enterprise release 3 later this year we will make the entire enterprise solution available through the canonical store

5366249 we see ubuntu part of a larger trend toward fragmentation of the linux market linux itself isnt fragmenting but we see other companies besides red hat and novell moving up with canonical being so hot on the desktop and pushing hard on the server we think the desktop will work in their favor

5366253 these projects were given out under direct negotiations under the finance ministers anwar instruction now he talks about open tenders but when he was in the finance ministry he gave these projects to cronies
5366254 he is the first leader among the malays and the non malays who insult the nep
5366255 pkr was formed as a multiracial party which is malay dominant however since anwar was released from jail he no longer stresses on that
5366256 i have told the police i only had knowledge about these six boxes of evidence as i have seen it but i am not in the possession of it
5366257 the person who keeps these documents is anwar so dont hide them
5366258 these projects were given out under direct negotiations under the finance ministers anwar instruction now he talks about open tenders but when he was in the finance ministry he gave these projects to cronies

5366261 anwar and wan azizah should know better than anyone else that abdullah would never condone such cruelty to anybody because he is not that type of person
5366262 abdullah told azizah that he was a muslim leader and he has never been cruel to anyone what more to anwar and wan azizah when he knew their parents
5366263 there has never been any leader who can fight corruption like abdullah including anwar
5366264 hes just stressed paige you know weve been having money troubles and blahblahfuckingblah
5366265 theyre going to turn the rose garden at the white house into a watermelon patch
5366266 this is not surprising considering that there is little evidence of a turnaround in housing
5366267 may be an indication that we are nearing the bottom of the long downswing in new home sales
5366268 we want to win the match as the manager i want to be able to go away from here and meet up with the seniors and say to fabio that at least four or five players perhaps even more have done extremely well within the team set up the team have won the game confidence is high with the game against portugal at wembley coming up and there have been no injuries
5366269 thats utopia for me as a manager we want to achieve a feel good factor
5366270 well be judged on how were do in the competition we are playing in weve given ourselves a reasonable base so far in the qualification campaign we also have to ensure theres a platform for these players to show their wares to fabio at senior level
5366271 its a doubled edged sword if you like they need to perform here for me and we need to drive this team forward but its also important that we can come away from any given game and individually the players have nudged fabios arm if you like and he thinks they are good enough for his squad
5366272 i was fortunate enough to come here with manchester city i think it was one of the first games at the stadium a pre season match five years ago or whenever and i was impressed by it then ive also had the honour of playing for hull city on trial when i was a 17 year old so i have a very small link with the club
5366273 the club are going in the right direction they have a fantastic manager who has a wealth of experience
5366274 its a great place to have an under 21 match if you cant get motivated to go out there in this stadium and play on that surface well i dont know what but i dont think ill have that problem

5366289 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5366290 even the u s military which has a greater number of smart weapons sometimes accidentally hits civilians
5366291 they sent the tu 22 crew to their deaths thinking that the georgian air defense would mount no resistance
5366292 using the tu 22 for a reconnaissance mission over georgia was the same as using a microscope to drive nails
5366293 the victorious russia has found itself in complete isolation that raises the question of whether it was a victory
5366294 georgias military losses were higher than russias but financial political and moral losses of russia were much higher than those of georgia

5366362 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5366363 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5366364 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality

5366373 we have always said that china is not an export led economy it is driven by domestic demand we think the supply side is going to have a harder time keeping up with demand than people think
5366374 our results were outstanding in the context of a challenging supply environment which was characterised by unexpected disruptions rising input prices skills shortages and the further devaluation of the us dollar

5366398 its so great to have a sweep because the usa hasnt been doing good so far
5366399 im happy to prove that were still the no 1 track team in the world
5366400 someone told me if you come to the birds nest you will have a golden egg
5366401 all i have done is a big sleep and some relaxation i just take it on my own
5366402 its going to be like that for the next three too
5366403 were trying to play with a chip on our shoulder we go out every night and try to get better going against greece and going against spain were easy to get up for we could have easily had one of those games where we came in and made excuses but we didnt take a step backwards today and that was good it was really good
5366404 its a real physical team and were looking forward to it were going to have to get a lot of rest and take care of our bodies because its going to be one of those physical games one thing were going to do is to try to get up and down and try to wear them down a lot
5366405 him coming in and sitting down chillin with us we got the opportunity to see him do his thing and im glad he got the opportunity to see us do ours usa is sticking together we enjoyed it
5366406 tempers are hot but i dont know what the implications of everything are here
5366407 weve got two wins and now weve been playing much better we proved that we can beat them in the world league we beat them 3 0 although we lost to them later in the tournament
5366408 now that i have learned their highest and lowest scores are the same the highest deduction score loses
5366409 i dont know if anybody understands what is going on
5366410 i knew i didnt have my best routine when i saw we got the same score and my name was second it was weird
5366411 i injured it at practice several weeks ago but i forgot about it when i competed
5366412 if we can get the win in early we will
5366413 if michael phelps can win eight gold medals why cant usa softball
5366414 thats what olympic competition is about its about giving the people at home chills
5366415 none of us had much time to think about it it just turned in for us the canadians made us work for it
5366416 i think south korea is a typical fiba asia type of team that likes great ball movement and they take advantage of any outside looks they get
5366417 a lot of what they do is perimeter oriented even though they have a few decent post players they dont like to play with their backs to the baskets they face up to the basket and they take you off the dribble there will be a lot of movement and we will be challenged to contain them on the perimeter and in the post but i think we are strong enough to impose our will on them
5366418 i think the biggest is that weve talked about as most asians teams they south korea are very good at shooting the three ball and shot fakes
5366419 tonight we struggled a lot with the shot fake going out of control and they got a lot of open shots that way thats one of the things that were really going to have to focus on they move the ball really well and the play team ball i played over in south korea for four years so some of the players ive actually played with theyve been on my team im looking forward to playing against them
5366420 but we are happy with the way we played each game and our performance on the field
5366421 we worked hard to make sure we were in the olympics
5366422 our goal was to be on the podium but we missed out on points to make that happen
5366423 its disappointing and frustrating but we are going to come out no matter what position we are fighting for and we are going to play our hardest
5366424 i injured it at practice several weeks ago but i forgot about it when i competed
5366425 todd told me it would sneak over to the last set but i didnt think so
5366426 our goal was to win our group and now weve done that
5366427 for us the tournament makes no sense we are playing for flowers now
5366428 lessons were learned and it was a great motivation for coming to beijing but that has never been a sore point for me
5366429 i knew i had to get out on that run
5366430 coming down on the last lap i had to throw in whatever i had left theres nothing like running scared i had to make sure i didnt leave anything out on that field i put every ounce of energy into this
5366431 i was just able to gain a lap at the right moment
5366432 today we were pretty relaxed and we were joking around
5366433 we saw all the boats behind us at one point and we thought to ourselves we might as well win our only olympic medal race
5366434 when we crossed the finish line we were screaming and crying and shouting
5366435 this feeling has not sunk in yet were still so stunned and we cannot stop laughing
5366436 we are really proud of what we are bringing to the table
5366437 we are taking a risk we have nothing to lose our free routine is off the wall nothing like this has ever been before and our expectation is for people to remember us
5366438 i wanted to come to the olympic games and break olympic records and world records
5366439 i didnt make any secret of this i said openly that i came to win and break the records its not just empty talk i did it i am very thankful to those who told me i could not do it
5366440 i feel like im on top of the world right now
5366441 its an honour to be mentioned in the same breath as ed moses he is a legend
5366442 it has all been about keeping the faith and staying strong over the last four years
5366443 were scooped up and shuffled in shackles to a fairground designed to hold cattle

5366446 theyre heavily concentrated in states where home prices are plummeting
5366447 could go down the street and get that loan somewhere else
5366448 it was pretty evident that the only thing that was supporting these loans was higher home prices
5366449 the home buying public is going to have to pay
5366450 to stay competitive in the market and take steps to preserve market share
5366451 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5366452 the city is a cold place now people are fearful
5366453 today according to the peace plan the withdrawal of russian peacekeepers and reinforcements has begun
5366454 it has been only 10 days since you faced a cowardly aggression
5366455 i am sure that such a well done effective and peacemaking operation aimed at protecting our citizens and other people will be among the most glorious deeds of the russian military
5366456 by awarding these grants to some of the most promising companies within the pckiz we are helping to unlock potential for jobs that will help to revitalize the hill district and other neighborhoods in the city
5366457 at the same time we are advancing innovation among new and young companies
5366458 it will make it such a heightened experience for the audience and for us to cast a real life soldier a veteran and bring him into our created drama
5366459 its a very delicate subject to begin with theres so much about the individual person thats going to help us create the character and whatever they bring and whatever their challenge is will be fit into the story
5366460 increasing fuel prices highway congestion airline issues and environmental awareness continue to make intercity passenger rail extremely relevant and popular
5366461 they seem to have harnessed all their instruments of national power military diplomatic information in a very disciplined way
5366462 it appears this was well thought out and planned in advance and suggests a level of coordination in the russian government between the military and the other civilian agencies and departments that we are striving for today
5366463 this exercise was exactly what they executed in georgia just a few weeks later
5366464 as i write this russia is waging war on my country

5366478 if by 2025 all cars on the road are hybrids and half are plug in hybrids u s oil imports would drop by 8 million barrels per day
5366479 i dont want this sport to be an every four year sport
5366480 i think yeah we get the most attention every four years
5366481 thats probably the first question i have no answer to
5366482 the talent that i have the drive that i have the want to succeed the excitement about the sport im fortunate to have every quality that i have and i wouldnt trade it in
5366483 and over the past years i havent seen him change
5366484 you cant put it in words the level of achievement that he has done here is phenomenal and in my opinion well never ever see it again i just dont think that can ever be emulated or beaten in an age where the sport is so competitive and so close
5366485 he made the pressure putt in the u s open he won the tour de france and he knocked out the best fighter in the world in the 16th round with an uppercut he did absolutely everything sport is supposed to be and he did it with a smile on his face
5366486 i dont want this sport to be an every four year sport

5366493 they did not fix races to ensure a particular horse won
5366494 on the contrary the object was to wager large amounts of money on a particular horse to lose whilst knowing that the jockey was prepared if necessary to cheat by stopping the horse
5366495 kieren fallon was more cautious and rodgers had indirect contact with him using as intermediaries shaun lynch his brother fergal lynch and philip sherkle
5366496 he would wager frequently more than 100 000 on a horse to lose and if the horse lost he would win about 20 000
5366497 that indicated a knowledge about the outcome of the race that was not shared by the rest of the market
5366498 i really havent thought that far in advance right now i want to just go home and spend some time with my daughter and go from there
5366499 you dont have to put an age limit on your dreams
5366500 somehow giving childbirth came up and being in the stirrups

5366515 i think i false started then i kind of hesitated it was really a rookie mistake
5366516 burnett is known as a daredevil and can compete some of the highest difficulty
5366517 you have to be willing to try new things to push the envelope
5366518 oh yea hell just keep jumping until he can reach it and grab on its crazy its like he has no fear
5366519 that im the best at one aspect in this sport is amazing
5366520 so i know i have all the skills and once i put the form to it which is coming means its definitely possible to win a medal at the olympics
5366521 usually right before my turn ill watch the judges to see whos up there theyre the scariest part of the competition you know five suits sitting there getting ready to watch us so i try to see them and just sort of stare them down
5366522 i used to try and avoid them but theres no way you can do that because before you do your routine you have to turn and face them thats when my heart would start racing so now i just face them beforehand
5366523 china has solidified itself as the new powerhouse in trampoline which is huge since its traditionally dominated by european nations
5366524 china is so deep with talent that they have about a half dozen male athletes who could win medals but a country can send a maximum of only two athletes

5366534 our work has unfortunately been frustrated by georgian authorities including the church
5366535 most of the latest computer models inland over florida and once this happens the storm will weaken somewhat
5366536 this could mean a slow erratic storm movement some ideas suggest that fay could even stall for a day or two somewhere over the southeastern united states
5366537 no matter what happened between us georgia is always open to settling all problems through dialogue or talks based on civilized relations
5366538 you will not attain your goal which has already been made clear to everyone georgia will not fall apart tbilisi has not run empty the government is in place the georgian army has not been and will not be destroyed most importantly the georgians spirit has not been broken
5366539 as soon as your army leaves georgia we should start considering further talks to find an appropriate format of further contacts so that our countries do not get finally isolated
5366540 moscow has repeatedly stated that there are no impediments to negotiations with georgia at the same time for reasons absolutely understandable to any sensible person we do not regard mikheil saakashvili as a negotiating partner
5366541 were in afghanistan because this is the central front in the war on terrorism
5366542 why are the basketball players from the us mens team so famous already
5366543 why do the keep talking about how much money michael phelps is going to make

5366559 should be read in the context of a company that s still in the mode of defining its resource base
5366560 these oilsands projects need a certain threshold to flick the light switch on
5366561 the other ones i think are still a little early in their lives to know whether there s sufficient resources to have critical mass to go forward
5366562 that s usually a point when other players are savvy in the business would like to take over
5366563 there s quite a number of these early stage oilsands companies that are undercapitalized and have significant resource opportunities in this current capital market they haven t performed particularly well
5366564 dan carter and i were just talking about that on the way in here that its just so refreshing to be able to play at that time with a dry ball

5366578 well it kept them from having a giant advantage the whole day like theyve had for the first half of the year
5366579 to me i like the change that they made i think it leveled the playing field i didnt feel like when i was racing with tony or brian that one of us had a big advantage
5366580 i thought it was pretty even so we work really hard on our cars just like they do weve worked with a little bit of a deficit in the engine department and im just happy with the change that nascar made i think the racing you saw today and the parity out there was a result of that
5366581 doing the dyno they found a piece again im not going to go into technically all it was because im not even sure yet on the race car
5366582 there was a piece there that wouldnt let the pedal apparently go all the way down in the dyno and it showed like we had less horsepower than we actually did
5366583 let me just say that first and foremost that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys at jgr
5366584 this one here is clearly if it turns out what it is its an intentional opportunity to lead someone astray
5366585 your evil spawn angelina jolie and her vacuous hubby brad pitt make about 40 million a year in violent psychopathic movies and give away three of it to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity as they spit out more dunces that will consume more than their fair share and wreck the earth even more

5366709 siamo in una fase preliminare del lavoro ma c totale accordo
5366710 the worlds thirst for energy is creating an environmental crisis that could soon become a security crisis for the united states
5366711 we used an estimated 4 quadrillion british thermal units on air conditioning in 2006 which is more than the total energy usage of all but 21 countries and a fair amount of that is peak usage the sort that sends the electric grid crackling toward brownouts and meltdowns and increases the demand for the construction of more electric power plants
5366712 keep in mind in tropical storm winds we cannot guarantee a response in an emergency situation
5366713 so you choose to drive during dangerous winds you may be on your own ambulance crews and firefighters may not be available either
5366714 fay is forecast to become a hurricane as it nears the southwestern florida coast on tuesday
5366715 preparations to protect life and property should be rushed to completion
5366716 a turn toward the north with a slower forward speed is expected later today and tonight with a generally northward motion expected on tuesday
5366717 the impact is very low we have minimal damage as of now
5366718 the river swept them away as if they were driftwood
5366719 his skills really get magnified when surrounded by great players like this
5366720 hahaha the silly engleeeesh thought i would sign for them for 50p
5366721 as i was passing a pickup truck in the other lane a dog riding in the back jumped out of the vehicle it was tied to the truck with a long length of chain
5366722 it was just awful i turned around to help the owners but the dog was covered in blood he was limp and lifeless when i got to them the owners were in shock one of them called 911 because the owners didnt know what else to do i gave them the number and directions for a local vet but i dont know what happened after that
5366723 this poor animal his chain was too long he had too much mobility in the back of the truck and he took advantage of it there are proper ways to secure a dog the best being having them ride inside the vehicle with a pet restraint or a secured crate if they are travelling in the back of a truck
5366724 for the most part people just dont realize how to secure their dog properly they think any length of chain or rope is fine because thats how theyve always done it i feel so bad for the family of this dog they were well meaning by using a chain to secure it they didnt mean for this happen they did have him restricted but it just wasnt enough
5366725 there is a fine of 109 under the motor vehicle act for failure to properly secure an animal while in transport but i dont think a lot of people know that
5366726 most of the calls we get about dogs in cars are to do with them trapped in vehicles on hot days people are starting to call in more and more about that because they are becoming familiar with the bylaw
5366727 its really motivated me to organize some educational clinics on pet safety in a blink of eye people can lose their pet if they dont know how to properly secure them id like to help make them aware of how to do that
5366728 to make matters worse lightning has impacted some of our computer systems meaning crews have to manually check each substation to assess damage
5366729 weve created a consultation process to ensure that all who wish to participate will have an opportunity to do so in as meaningful and convenient a manner as possible
5366730 we are hoping the feedback will be as comprehensive and representative of the community as possible
5366731 there is clear direction of the need to implement further development guidelines regarding water conservation energy efficiency hill side development and environmentally sensitive land areas
5366732 we are now seeking public feedback to guide development of additional policies
5366733 to develop an effective approach to informing young women about this risk factor for breast cancer we need a better understanding of young women
5366734 as part of a study funded by the canadian breast cancer research alliance we are consulting young women age 15 to 24 from across the country on this topic to do this we have been conducting focus groups and are implementing an online survey to reach other women
5366735 the locations were chosen because of the provinces different smoking rates b c has the lowest provincial prevalence rate for smoking 15 per cent with new brunswick among the provinces with the highest rates 22 per cent the web based survey is intended to build on the knowledge gathered through focus groups by reaching out to a wider audience of young women the results of the survey will be used to prepare for a larger national study
5366736 the beetle has a one year life cycle so you wont be able to tell that theres been damage most of the trees that are being attacked right for up to 9 12 months
5366737 sometimes after the tree has been compromised woodpeckers will come in and strip the bark off its then you start to see trees turning yellow and red
5366738 the beetles are carried by the wind but they also fly most of the bug infestations are on the westside in the lodge pole pine populations at high elevations i expect thats where theyre coming from
5366739 a lot is dependent on weather i think a lot of the beetles would prefer to stay up in the high elevation forests where there is a lot of food the unpredictable factor is how quickly they will build up in the city
5366740 its pretty much run its course in the north and central interior sometime over the next five years we expect the beetles will have run out of food theyll either be dispersed into new areas or just die out
5366741 im sorry for the delay but as you can see im very busy what can i do for you
5366742 im from the phone company i came to hook up your phone
5366743 im not willing to trade sexual favors which is what a lot of people have been asking me

5366746 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared

5366754 national survey data show that the prevalence of overweight and obese adults in the u s has increased steadily over the past three decades
5366755 the health care costs attributable to obesity and overweight are expected to more than double every decade

5366858 like ghosts at the feast hillary and bill clinton threaten to project a baleful presence at what is meant to be barack obamas coming out party as the democrats white house champion
5366859 the challenge for obama lies in not having this convention come to closure with a clear message of unity and enthusiasm

5366869 one subsection of the visible consists of images and by images i mean first shadows then reflections in water and in all close packed smooth and shiny materials
5366870 in the other subsection of the visible put the originals of these images the animals around us the plants and the whole class of manufactured things
5366871 now the doctrine that is taught in secret about this matter is that we men are in a kind of prison and must not set ourselves free or run away

5366875 the great archetypes of the mind pure ideas find themselves usurped by mere sense images

5366877 do you truly wish to see the beloved in the cold clarity of the visual apparatus it may be in your best interest to throw a veil over the gaze so as to keep her alive in her archetypal goddesslike form
5366878 we cannot live our daily lives in a realm of pure ideas cocooned from sense experience the question is not how can we keep the imagination pure protected from the onslaughts of reality the question has to be can we find a way for the two to coexist
5366879 kept as fleeting as possible as a means toward stirring or activating the idea that lies buried more deeply
5366880 sense organs reach the limit of their powers their light begins to go out

5366889 do you hope you can expiate the crimes of the past by suffering in the present
5366890 but notice that lucy has never subscribed to metaphysical moral values her forte is refusing her fathers habit of seeing the world through metaphysical glasses

5366893 he has nothing against animal lovers the world would no doubt be a worse place without them
5366894 you think i ought to involve myself in more important things
5366895 only as long as i do not have to become a better person
5366896 i imagine that coetzee feels the force of almost all the ideas and emotions that his characters express he is working and living at the edge of our moral possibilities about animals much is fluid changing being created one positively ought to hold incompatible opinions as one works and lives ones way through to their resolution
5366897 perhaps he understands more than you guess perhaps he has already been through it born with foreknowledge so to speak this is africa after all there have been goats here since the beginning of time they dont have to be told what steel is for and fire they know how death comes to a goat

5366901 in refusing to single out the special dog lurie is accepting perhaps helplessly perhaps resolutely the claims of an infinite number of other creatures with whom he has no special connection who are neither his own kind nor his historical victims
5366902 but of course what binds me thus in my singularity to the singularity of the other immediately propels me into the space or risk of absolute sacrifice there are also the others an infinite number of them the innumerable generality of others to whom i should be bound by the same responsibility a general and universal italics mine responsibility what s ren kierkegaard calls the ethical order i cannot respond to the call the request the obligation or even the love of another without sacrificing the other other the other others

5366906 it is not even a bond with these two in particular whom he could not pick out from a whole mob in a field
5366907 the powerful but baffling claim made by the sheep on him is it seems far from either the emotional pull experienced by the animal lover or the ethical demand acknowledge by the upholder of animal rights
5366908 sheep do not own themselves do not own their lives they exist to be used every last ounce of them their flesh to be eaten their bones to be crunched and fed to poultry

5366913 t he dogs in the yard smell what is going on inside they flatten their ears they droop their tails as if they too feel the disgrace of dying
5366914 which they somehow know is going to harm them terribly

5366925 he is sensible of a generous affection streaming out toward him from the dog arbitrarily unconditionally he has been adopted the dog would die for him he knows

5366943 we all learned a lot out there for our first private oval test and i am really looking forward to returning here in september
5366944 to test on both sides of the country at two different tracks gave us some good baseline knowledge for the upcoming events
5366945 it was great to get a chance to see and drive the racetrack on belle isle again
5366946 its a place that has a lot of great memories and hopefully we can create a few more on labor day weekend
5366947 obviously we wanted to get it sorted out this year but with the new manager coming in and players coming in and out there wasnt enough time
5366948 i love it here the club wants to sign me and there wont be any problems on that front i just want to concentrate on my performances and play well because its not nice for the fans to have an ongoing thing but i will be a chelsea player for the rest of my career
5366949 the reality is that we think and the manager thinks that if august 31 comes and we are what we now then we have a squad
5366950 we think robinho is the right age and brings some difference to the squad it would add to the squad but were not going to win or lose this season because we have or havent got robinho
5366951 i am competing with other people in the squad and you want to play well
5366952 when you get the chance you have to produce and thats always the case at this club
5366953 when you join a big club you have to expect competition i have always thrived on it i have always been up against big players at the club i love competing and learning from them
5366954 i know i have to step it up again football is a game that doesnt stay still i performed well last season and the fans voted me player of the year but thats all in the past now
5366955 it has a great staff and ideal facilities for our needs but this time it happened to be out of the question
5366956 as soon as the city announced that victoria halls main hall would be closed over the summer i felt a twinge of uneasiness because i knew there was a by election coming and we would probably have to schedule the meet the candidates evening at some point during the time vic hall was closed thats exactly what happened but westmount high school will suit our purposes nicely
5366957 we had to wait for english montreal school board staff to return from their summer vacations before we could get the final okay

5366959 fay looks like it will be far removed from major oil producing areas but until its better defined we should still see some volatility in the market
5366960 allow ourselves a little bit more leeway in terms of sculpting the sound in the studio and doing overdubs and using the studio as another instrument last time around it was more of a document
5366961 none of them are a statement that i would be comfortable making right now at this point in my life they all served their purpose and in that respect im proud of all of them
5366962 but as something that feels artistically in keeping with who i am today i think that they are inevitably going to fall short of that as time goes on i mean they just dont continue to mean the same things to me and a new record is kind of where its at
5366963 over a number of years that will help researchers to develop better approaches to diagnosis and treatment
5366964 the brain operates according to how quickly calcium and sodium are going in and out of cells and how much of it goes in and out
5366965 its not going to tell us the whole story it doesnt give you the whole puzzle but its something to build on
5366966 i would probably be in a wheelchair if it wasnt for these walks
5366967 once we started setting up these walking programs its taken on a life of its own
5366968 if theyre home all day inside a locked place the kids are going to start munching away on snacks
5366969 i think we stumbled across an important piece here which is that people want to know their neighbors
5366970 people feel much more empowered by walking with their neighbors
5366971 levels of stress in this community are so high especially because of the recent anti immigration attitudes and because some of the residents have two or three jobs
5366972 people in this community overeat for a whole series of psychological reasons thats why im so pleased with these outcomes
5366973 participating in a walking group not only improves health but also increases social interaction among californians we see this as an opportunity for more social interaction that brings us back to a more unifying society
5366974 my wife and i used to wake up early and walk but there was no one around
5366975 i like the group my wife had been suffering from depression and she feels so much better
5366976 when i hear women are being treated unfairly in the workplace where theres injustice and theres not the basic principle of equal pay for equal work i get mad i get frustrated
5366977 my daughters i dont want them to ever confront a situation where they are disadvantaged because of their gender
5366978 the thought of it makes my blood boil thats what were fighting for
5366979 now you want to win and saying it doesnt make it so
5366980 it would be nice to think that after eight years of economic disaster after eight years of bungled foreign policy of being engaged in a war that should never have been authorized and should never have been waged that cost us a trillion dollars and thousands of lives that people would say lets toss the bums out
5366981 so i understand why a lot of folks are saying this should just happen why are we having to run all these television commercials why do we have to raise all this money just read the papers these are the knuckleheads who have been in charge throw em out but american politics arent that simple
5366982 the fact of the matter is at a certain point when government has not been serving the people for this long people get cynical they tune out and they start saying to themselves a plague on both your houses they are willing to consume negative information more frequently than positive information for good reason theyve seen how promises havent been kept
5366983 john mccain all he wants to do is talk about me they know they cant win on the issues so what theyll do is theyll try to scare people hes risky hes risky
5366984 not only do you have a candidate who doesnt take any guff
5366985 not only do you have a candidate who will hit back swiftly and forcefully and truthfully
5366986 international organized criminals control significant positions in the global energy and strategic materials markets they are expanding their holdings in these sectors which corrupts the normal functioning of these markets and may have a destabilizing effect on us geopolitical interests
5366987 what did henry paulson know and when did he know it
5366988 my father was out of work so i was eligible i was single and i was out of school and all and unemployed
5366989 it was good physical work good hard work but we were well fed and well cared for
5366990 young professionals across the nation conservation professionals park professionals have really stepped forward to honor the guys
5366991 at the time during the depression it was tough and my father was working for a company in waterbury and he was only working a couple days a week
5366992 so we needed food on the table there were seven of us besides mother and father nine people ate a lot of food
5366993 should evaluate the effectiveness of screening for psychiatric and substance use disorders on decreasing adverse outcomes such as suicide attempts during the postpartum period
5366994 perhaps there is a mentality that you cant beat city hall
5366995 im not a crybaby about what goes on in the world
5366996 people like my mom you expect them to be upset people who are doing a lot of saving now versus people who are done saving are two very different groups
5366997 i shop at the 99 cent stores there are ways of saving money
5366998 they grew up with the mentality that you make the best of what is handed to you they dont worry they wont make it to rome or paris this year they will settle for a car trip
5366999 the feds rate cuts geared to aiding ailing homeowners with adjustable rate mortgages have come at the expense of savers and retirees dependent on fixed income
5367000 for the past 12 months there has been a double whammy for savers as interest rates have fallen and inflation has increased
5367001 i was outraged these companies make their decisions and their bets and they should be responsible for that they should not be bailed out on the backs of the taxpayers
5367002 we really want to get the message out to people
5367003 i got back the standard form letter thank you for your comment
5367004 who is supposed to be more on top of financial things than a bank but banks made all these terrible mortgage loans and caused these disruptions and we are dependent on them for our financial security
5367005 there is some hard thinking that needs to be done
5367006 the fed has a terrific reputation as a credible institution we have to be cautious not to undertake things that put that credibility at risk
5367007 they want to placate the congress and the financial markets
5367008 how can you be independent on one score and dependent on another
5367009 are overburdening the federal reserve and that sets up the potential for multiple conflicts
5367010 they use up their credibility on nonmonetary issues they lose their independence and they dilute their expertise
5367011 it is much harder to say no when you have the precedent
5367012 congress needs to find a way to structure something else to take the fed out of this
5367013 they have had to abandon all principles that guided their earlier debates
5367014 but the truth is that the beneficiaries of our actions were not bear stearns and were not even principally wall street it was main street
5367015 the financial system has been under a lot of stress and that has affected our ability to grow its affected employment its affected credit availability
5367016 we are in a new environment and the fed had to do something different
5367017 attention should be paid to the risk that market participants might incorrectly view the fed as a source of unconditional support
5367018 is going to become a major regulator of financial institutions
5367019 that can come at a very big cost to innovation and the welfare of the country
5367020 what has been put on the plate is the broader role of central banks in their effort to promote or ensure financial stability
5367021 we have to face up to the potential risks to the conduct of sound monetary policy from acquiring these other responsibilities
5367022 well hes an amazing guy ryan anybody would be very lucky to be dating him
5367023 in truth my time in como was clooney free sorry to disappoint lago di como however was beautiful or at least it was beautiful the one day it didnt rain luckily that was the day i picked to cruise the lake on the public ferries its about 2 hours by ferry up the lake to bellagio where i wandered for awhile enjoying the sun and the views then a quick 15 minute ferry hop to varenna a very quaint teeny lake side village then back to como by the ferry again it was in a nutshell gorgeous
5367024 like pluto in the belt of icy debris beyond neptune then been kicked a large distance by a gravitational encounter with neptune or uranus

5367030 my friends were telling me that his stare was fixed about me she tells the daily star at last came his request for my mobile telephone number in the end i surrendered i have felt myself courted in a fairly good and elegant way it was like a 2 day date we started sending messages by mobile telephone he has called me all night long

5367035 the advisory council on the misuse of drugs found they were increasingly being used as a legal substitute for ghb particularly as a club drug and can lead to dependence unconsciousness and even death by intoxication
5367036 theres a real gap in north somerset there is not enough support for victims of sexual crime its really quite poor
5367037 theres isnt a crisis centre people get help from the police if they take it to court but they need help whether they go to court or not
5367038 these people have just been through an awful ordeal and they dont want to have to travel to bristol to get help
5367039 about two thirds of the people we support who are victims of domestic abuse have also been subjected to sexual violence
5367040 and the majority of rape victims are attacked by a family member or someone they know so there are a lot of similarities with domestic abuse cases
5367041 if someone is raped it is hugely traumatic and it can really affect their lives and shatter their confidence
5367042 they need a lot of help and we want to be able to help people to help themselves
5367043 the ideal support service would be crisis counselling to deal specifically with sexual abuse and a helpline
5367044 theres a patchwork of support in the area but there are huge gaps
5367045 however there are organisations like ours which do care about the issues and will do their best to help people or point them in the right direction to access more support

5367064 you dont just drop a large metal monolith in a park without some planning
5367065 what the monolith is and what it means is never fully explained in the film
5367066 i think it is fun and a lot of people want to see it but it isnt what we want to encourage
5367067 well keep it up there for a while and then i hope the owner will step forward and take it down were not going to leave it up forever

5367073 its true that theres nothing funnier than watching an emotionally or intellectually unstable person have a dramatic public meltdown to a few pokes amp prods it only gets better when the target escalates the situation with even more drama
5367074 you know how on your favorite basic cable reality shows the camera captures some crazy persons meltdown you squeal with delight at the sheer entertainment value of it
5367075 the only way civilization will stop this destructive force is by not trivializing it not thinking
5367076 theres one curious thing that goes on in this more popular treatment of a long known phenomenon and that is characterizing these activities as
5367077 now we believe in the separation of church and state
5367078 but we do not believe in the separation of faith and politics because faith is just a world view and everybody has some kind of world view
5367079 i think americas greatest moral failure in my lifetime is that we still dont abide by that basic precept in matthew that whatever you do for the least of my brothers you do for me
5367080 there is a pervasive sense i think that this country is wealthy and powerful as we still dont spend enough time thinking about the least of these
5367081 has been throughout our existence perhaps that we have not devoted ourselves to causes greater than our self interest although weve been at the best at it of anybody in the world
5367082 the first words of your very successful book is this is not about you
5367083 and you know that really also means serve a cause greater than your self interest
5367084 may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5367085 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama he seemed so well prepared
5367086 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous

5367111 send the crowd away that they may go into the surrounding villages and countryside and find lodging and get something to eat for here we are in a desolate place
5367112 wherein he calls the apostles to breaking of bread that the greatness of the miracle might be more evident by their testimony that they the people had none no food
5367113 then jesus called his disciples to him and said i have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat and i am unwilling to send them away hungry lest they faint on the way
5367114 the people had plenty of food but they were hoarding it jesus taught them to share so they all pulled out their surplus of food from under their robes and everyone shared with his neighbor that is the lesson jesus did not do a physical miracle the real miracle was convincing selfish people to share with others
5367115 jesus took the seven loaves and the fish and giving thanks he broke them and started giving them to the disciples and the disciples gave them to the people
5367116 the multitude receives the food from the lord through the apostles as it follows and he gave the loaves to his disciples and the disciples to the multitude
5367117 this is truly the prophet who is to come into the world
5367118 why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread do you not yet perceive or understand are your hearts hardened having eyes do you not see and having ears do you not hear and do you not remember when i broke the five loaves for the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up
5367119 and the seven for the four thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up
5367120 i was stressed even more when my parents punished me too much and scolded me every day saying i was a very bad boy
5367121 i really hate them when they talk too much about me during meals
5367122 under all this pressure my life feels meaningless i m alive but i feel like a prisoner in my own home
5367123 sometimes i want to kill myself to escape from my parents close watch and insults

5367135 we hope offering the best accommodations food course design and prize purse will help to create a very competitive start line for the 2009 event
5367136 es el gran fracaso de la anterior ley de conservaci n de la naturaleza
5367137 es posible que sean 20 las especies que cuenten con planes de recuperaci n pero el problema es que algunas como el lince ib rico o el guila imperial los tienen aprobados en castilla la mancha y extremadura pero no en andaluc a y madrid porque la protecci n es incompleta
5367138 ahora tienen un m ximo de tres a os para aprobarlos aunque legalmente se podr a ir m s all e impedir que ninguna comunidad reciba financiaci n p blica para conservaci n de una especie en peligro si no cuenta con su plan correspondiente

5367164 until a decade ago gay people were seen as a security threat and as recently as two decades ago they were being witch hunted and sacked from the security services
5367165 it was part of the cold war mentality that saw security threats traitors and spies everywhere
5367166 gay people were regarded as vulnerable to blackmail even if they were open and out about their sexuality

5367175 both embody a post polarized or anti polarized style of politics
5367176 mccain crucially missed the sixties and in some ways hes a pre sixties figure he and obama dont resonate with the sixties at all
5367177 the fact that there was no conventional establishment old style conservative candidate was not an accident
5367178 mitt romney pretended to be one for a while but he wasnt rudy giuliani sort of pretended but he wasnt mccain is certainly not its not only a lack of political just no driving force and it will soften up normal republicans for change

5367180 the shape of your body can have a dramatic effect on your health
5367181 in both scenarios people were asked to make a decision not a choice they were asked to decide rather than to choose
5367182 most women and men for that matter understand intuitively whether their bodies tend to store fat around their waists forming an apple shape or lower down around their hips thighs and buttocks forming a pear shape in women but few of us understand the dramatic impact body shape has on our current health and risk of future disease a number of recent studies have shown that it is your waist size and body shape rather than how much you weigh or tip the scale that best predicts your risk for a number of chronic diseases for example a study published in this weeks archives of internal medicine found that while only half of the obese patients studied had metabolic abnormalities that placed them at much greater risk of heart disease a full quarter of the normal weight adults had these same worrisome metabolic risks as well why the risk in normal weight adults experts concluded that waist size may be much more important in determining heart risk than body weight a normal weight individual can have a greater waist size and therefore a greater health risk than an overweight but smaller waisted friend

5367194 we have made another important step to increase polands security
5367195 and it is the russians who convince us how important it is as our sad experience teaches us the louder they protest against something we want to do the more certain it is that it lies in our best interest

5367228 when you join a big club you have to expect competition i have always thrived on it
5367229 i have always been up against big players at the club i love competing and learning from them
5367230 i love it here the club wants to sign me and there wont be any problems on that front
5367231 compared to a decade ago there are three million more people in work in britain and they all enjoy more employment rights than they would have in the past important minimum standards on wages paid leave maternity leave and conditions have been put in place
5367232 we want to prevent unscrupulous employers who undercut honest competition and prey on people who are fearful or so desperate to earn a living that they are open to exploitation
5367233 it is vital we boost awareness of employment rights and ensure those rights are properly enforced there should be no hiding place for employers who exploit vulnerable workers and who are not prepared to obey the law
5367234 i am elated and delighted to be joining the cast of csi
5367235 this gentleman knows this about himself and is in this journey to discover who his true character will ultimately become
5367236 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5367237 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range
5367238 what makes shows go off the rails is they forget who they are were a crime mystery forensics drama
5367239 one of immense importance from the perspective of public health and safety
5367240 the fda is in no position to ensure the safety of prescription drugs
5367241 seriously hampered in its ability to determine the risks of drugs before they are approved for sale but it has proven inadequate to the task of addressing hazards that only become apparent after a drug has been widely marketed to an unsuspecting public
5367242 im on my way to wilmington right now to see whats going on and were just a half mile away from adam amp eve
5367243 you know this is another city in north carolina and we just beat them in one
5367244 ill tell you what i need help in this state
5367245 if this keeps going i cant continue to fight this this is ridiculous they say theyre having complaints theyre not having any complaints what it is it all stems from one thing new bern the preponderance and the sales figures and i know that because they wilmington police asked for them and i said i refused to give them anything when i go down there im going to turn it over to my attorneys im going to refuse to give them anything at this point

5367249 we dont want people to focus on the exact track this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall

5367251 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5367252 everybody seems to be acting like this is a non event
5367253 we will not be treating it as a friendly against scotland as we want to get into good habits
5367254 i am enjoying my football again we have a good manager craig levein who is keen to get things going and take the club forward
5367255 he wants to challenge the old firm and although we have only played two games i do not see why we cannot do that
5367256 it gives the fringe players a good chance to get in there and perhaps leave the manager with something to think about with the qualifier to come in three weeks
5367257 i love playing for my country it is the highlight of any players career it would be great to start but that is the managers decision
5367258 the fact we are playing one of the home nations in scotland makes it special as well and something i would love to be part of

5367282 despite the quid pro quo nature of the deal we believe google will benefit disproportionately from this deal over time given the enticing opportunity to take a peek under the hood at yahoo
5367283 importantly the broader deal with a search and non search components could have a higher probability of clearing regulatory hurdles in our opinion instead of denying a stand alone search deal on the basis of googles dominant search market share the regulators will be forced to evaluate this broader advertising deal where no single company enjoys a significant market lead
5367284 a user of a newsgroup forum or message board that posts messages with the intent of inciting an argument or flame war
5367285 its true that theres nothing funnier than watching an emotionally or intellectually unstable person have a dramatic public meltdown to a few pokes amp prods it only gets better when the target escalates the situation with even more drama
5367286 you know how on your favorite basic cable reality shows the camera captures some crazy persons meltdown you squeal with delight at the sheer entertainment value of it
5367287 the only way civilization will stop this destructive force is by not trivializing it not thinking

5367292 the main front in the war against the zionist crusaders
5367293 mccain has never been deft with language i thought that what he meant when he said that invading other nations is outre was that nations do not invade others for territorial aggrandizement anymore the usa has certainly given that up a long time ago and our anti colonial policy after wwi was of a piece with that and has come to be near universally accepted as a good idea

5367298 the company looks forward to announcing a replacement film as soon as possible
5367299 when warner bros decided to move harry potter and the half blood prince to the summer of 2009 we saw a unique opportunity to slot in our film which has been gaining tremendous awareness and momentum over the past several months
5367300 we by no means are trying to fill the shoes of the incredible potter franchise for 2008 rather we are just looking to bring the fans of stephenie meyers incredible book series the film as soon possible from a programming perspective

5367308 if this trend is sustained and the dollar really does stay on this streak then i do think it is going to slow things down
5367309 the run down in the dollar fueled a lot of the cross border deals that have been done over the last 12 to 18 months so therefore youd think a run up would slow it down

5367335 we honestly had some reservations at first about how consumers might react to a new domain but early testing on keyword ads and other studies showed that people seemed to respond extremely well to a travel address we do still have a couple legacy com and org domains which were gradually transitioning over to travel but the long term plan is to eventually have everything fall under the travel umbrella
5367336 if the travel registrars continue managing the assignment of names responsibly it will payoff in the long term by adding an extra level of credibility to travel sites
5367337 it has a great staff and ideal facilities for our needs but this time it happened to be out of the question
5367338 as soon as the city announced that victoria halls main hall would be closed over the summer i felt a twinge of uneasiness because i knew there was a by election coming and we would probably have to schedule the meet the candidates evening at some point during the time vic hall was closed thats exactly what happened but westmount high school will suit our purposes nicely

5367370 the context in which a term is used in the asserted claim can be highly instructive
5367371 a n element in the accused device is equivalent to a claim limitation if the only differences between the two are insubstantial
5367372 performs substantially the same function in substantially the same way to obtain substantially the same result
5367373 performed the same function as a straight portion in the same way to achieve the same result accordingly we affirm the jurys findings of infringement with respect to these claims

5367380 this is ralph trying to get back into the tent not mccain wanting a new teepee
5367381 i dont think john mccain is begging for ralph reeds help after he reed was humiliated at the polls in his own state
5367382 mccains going to get the so called evangelical vote and ralph doesnt control whats left of its organized version anyway
5367383 people living in the past news cycles who dont realize a guy trying to stay relevant from a presidential candidate trying to grab hold of a political machinery that reed no longer controls
5367384 he knows reed was part of that movie and it was to help defeat him mccain again in south carolina and just because you raise a little money isnt going to make that second round of attacks go away
5367385 the rights and obligations upon men and women in islaam
5367386 bruce is responsible for much of the development and growth thats gone on in brooklyn and in manhattan he is a major force in new york city for the good
5367387 drove home the message by meeting with the separatist leaders of abkhazia and south ossetia
5367388 i dont see any prospect for the use of military force by the united states in this situation
5367389 there was a brief five year period when we could get away with treating russia like jamaica thats over now we have to deal with them like grown ups who have more nuclear weapons than anybody except us
5367390 like grown ups fat chance with mccains chief foreign policy advisor being the former registered former agent of georgia fat chance with mccain echoing the bush foreign policy line
5367391 bullying and intimidation are not acceptable ways to conduct foreign policy in the 21st century
5367392 georgia will become a member of nato if it wants to and it does want to

5367400 were pretty excited about finishing pool play undefeated and getting onto the medal round
5367401 we are healthy i think the team has played well and we are very excited about getting into the medal round it is time to win a gold medal
5367402 i just had to get myself going running the floor and getting deep in the paint and going right into the shot and being a big presence for the team
5367403 what we have seen is they us play extremely hard on the defensive end they are very unselfish they always find the open guy and they also shot the three point very well
5367404 when they have these three things great defence share the ball and shoot the ball well they are unbeatable
5367405 were in a tournament and now we get to play the best team in the world and have a swing at the big dog im confident we are going to go out there and play ball
5367406 we are really really happy because this is the first team match and we got the bronze medal i thank very much my teammates and the coaching staff
5367407 i didnt play at my peak level but this is human you know
5367408 we are fourth and this is the best result for the austrian team so far and i think we can be proud of that
5367409 our sales results for the quarter while better than our forecast reflect the realities of the continuing macro economic pressures on our industry
5367410 we believe our second quarter sales benefited from the economic impact of the fiscal stimulus tax rebates unfortunately weakness in bigger ticket projects continues particularly in markets most impacted by the housing downturn
5367411 the macro economic factors pressuring consumers and the ongoing challenges and uncertainty of the financial markets suggest a cautious sales forecast for the balance of fiscal 2008 is prudent
5367412 we remain focused on positioning the company for long term success while managing through the near term challenges of the current environment
5367413 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5367414 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5367415 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5367416 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent

5367480 anything such as that or any other military equipment that was moved in would be in violation of this cease fire and should be removed immediately
5367481 we will continue to closely monitor russian actions in georgia for confirmation of the withdrawal this is something that should be achieved without delay

5367496 i think john mccain is a fantastic leader he and barack obama have the same goal in mind peace and prosperity for the united states i just like barack obamas path to get there better than john mccains
5367497 as i looked at the candidates in order to know who to vote for certainly my kind of conservatism was reflected in sen obama
5367498 those points are that were fiscally conservative we care about revenues matching expenditures we also care about the environment i think its a traditional conservative value to care about clean air and clean water sen obama is terrific on that issue personal liberties such as the first amendment the fourth amendment a womans reproductive freedom sen obama is strong on that i consider that traditional conservatism personal liberties fear of foreign entanglements sen obama was a leader in speaking out against the war in iraq and i consider that traditional conservatism
5367499 barack obamas platform has been a call for change but the change that he is so gracefully articulating is more renewal than departure and by this i mean while a break with the ideological policies of the moment it is rooted in very old american values that are as much a part of the republican as the democratic tradition
5367500 there is an emphasis on individual rights fairness and balance at home and progressive internationalism and above anything else im convinced that the national interest requires a new approach to our interactions with the world including a recognition that the long term occupation of iraq is likely to be dangerously destabilizing and that its preferable to speak with rather than shun potential adversaries
5367501 when it became clear that the nominees would be mccain and obama many republicans all around the country started calling one another to say who will we be for what are we going to do in this election and a very large number of us feel deeply that john mccain good man that he is will be a continuation of bush and we will have particularly in the foreign policy field but also in terms of fiscal integrity a bush third term and that is something that we are strongly opposed to its difficult to walk away from your partys nominee but you have to put your country first
5367502 if im voting what its going to cost me in taxes ive already done that math and its going to cost me a little more under obamas plan but it shouldnt be about what i pay in taxes it should be about the big picture
5367503 but think about the benefits that those people get their benefit from a stronger u s dollar lower energy costs energy independence is going to be phenomenal why wouldnt you make that choice
5367504 both sets of bushes and reagan all talked about government as being the problem make government smaller control the spending and what did all of them do they increased spending
5367505 as percentage of gdp spending is highest at 25 percent under reagan and right now were at 24 percent gdp with bushs 2009 budget that will be passed in october were spending more than we should government has gotten too big where does that hurt is it hurts us in the value of the dollar when the dollar is weak oil which is denominated in dollars is more expensive to americans our goods yes are cheaper overseas but everybody elses products which is far more to us because we buy so much from overseas is far more expensive
5367506 im not going to tell you that barack obama is as conservative as i am hes definitely not but our republican party has not held to its ideals they talk about fiscal responsibility but they obviously have not lived up to that so i dont think our own republican party has been so conservative
5367507 were at a time when we need to stop fighting about conservative solutions to our problems or liberal solutions to our problems and just come up with some good compromise solutions to the problems that we face
5367508 i voted for mccain in the 2000 primaries because he was more my type of republican at the time he was willing to buck the party when necessary and he was willing to put whats best for the country above everything else but obviously hes trying to have it both ways he tried to move to the right once he decided that hed be running for president but the right isnt buying it they still dont forgive him for some of his past perceived indiscretions
5367509 on our side were a very enthusiastic group we have hundeds of people who are active on the website and other ways which i think goes to show you that while people will say that only 10 to 15 percent of republicans support obama i think that 10 to 15 percent who do support him are very motivated and will show up on election day

5367621 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5367622 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families

5367732 not this time around still planning on coming back to the sgc but only as a civilian working on a political science degree figured itd be useful to be a little more diplomatic
5367733 hey i well he was a great diplomat just ask anyone
5367734 i dont know if i would exactly call that diplomacy
5367735 after i figured out how to open that damn door we pulled you out i sent the rest of them back to base camp once i saw you breathing okay and waking up i figured you didnt need a crowd theyre letting the sgc know youre safe and sound
5367736 thanks i feel so stupid getting locked in like that just out of curiosity what would you have done if you couldnt make the door work
5367737 im not joining the air force because as a civilian even though ill have to play by their rules to work at the sgc i wont have to live by their rules are you with me
5367738 because as a civilian i can do this and there isnt a damn thing they can say about it

5367744 its not enough to only compete on the field we hold ourselves to the highest standard off the field as well everyone is responsible for their part in continuing our legacy
5367745 we look for great people with strong character who are achievement oriented on the field and in the classroom as well our student athletes have a strong desire to continue to build our soccer program to the highest level
5367746 many of them are versatile players who can fill multiple roles they also understand what it takes to play at a very high level since they come from a winning culture at both the high school and club levels
5367747 she also understands how to help her teammates raise their level of play
5367748 gerst is exceptional technically in addition to scoring goals shes also a great playmaker and she is able to make plays for both herself and her teammates
5367749 allport bazin and watson are all outstanding at pressuring defenders with their speed and physical play
5367750 piasecki is a skillful player who is smart and very composed in the opponents end her technical ability allows her to create dangerous scoring chances whenever shes involved in a play
5367751 martin is someone that makes her team better because of her skill and her ability to make plays for our team
5367752 she has the ability to dominate a game and really gives us a potent attack
5367753 rohren is a strong ball winner who uses her physicality to possess the ball
5367754 shes capable of dominating opponents physically and has a great ability to challenge for balls out of the air and make plays from it
5367755 they are two of the teams most improved players and should be very effective at building our attack
5367756 tomaszewski is exceptional on the ball and she is dangerous any time she has the ball on her foot abbott britt and vallianatos are all strong possession players who should help us to possess the ball and penetrate defenses more effectively
5367757 burns is a tenacious defender and an anchor for us in the defense
5367758 she is great at organizing the players around her and can also be very dangerous when attacking from the back line
5367759 pelkki is a physical player who is strong in the air and has really developed her game during the spring
5367760 hill played a significant defensive role for us this past spring and has the intelligence and composure to make big plays for us
5367761 bellamy horton and toth are all smart and experienced players who stand out based on their technical ability and defensive instincts
5367762 they are also valuable in helping to transition into the attack after winning the ball from an opponent
5367763 we believe we already have two returning keepers who both have the potential to start for any team in the mac
5367764 we are going to play some very good teams on the road this fall including our second meeting with a talented big 12 opponent
5367765 cornell has a top 100 recruiting class this year and st bonaventure is definitely a program that continues to be on the rise

5367783 with time batsmen will get used to playing him even murali some seven eight years back was really difficult
5367784 everybody was talking about him with time i think it will get a bit easier mendis is a bit more unusual than murali i have not seen any bowler like this
5367785 mendis is difficult to pick because he is a very different bowler
5367786 but if you see the way he has played the two games against us even in the asia cup he gave away just ten runs in six or eight overs you need to take a few from him and a few from murali and look to attack the others youve got to have something on the board
5367787 we were off to a good start in the asia cup but then we lost quick wickets
5367788 after that when you are playing mendis its difficult it gets a bit tough when you have to rotate the strike and also save the wicket if the bowler is as unusual as mendis
5367789 once you get used to the variations then it gets easy for the batsmen the only option right now is to play more and more of him and thats the only way of getting better you can see a thousand videos but it doesnt matter until you go out there and play him off the track from 20 yards
5367790 definitely they will come back strongly they have a very good side and they have a lot of talented individual players who can change the match for them
5367791 so we will make sure we will play the same brand of cricket that we played today
5367792 virender is a big game player its important for them to have him but we are playing against india and not against individuals thats what we did in the test matches as well he can come and do his job but our task is to make sure it wont happen
5367793 we knew it was going to be tough the indian fast bowlers came strongly and bowled at the good areas when i was batting with kumar sangakkara i said lets bat the 15 20 overs thats crucial unfortunately kumar got out but i thought chamara kapugedera batted really well so we need to keep this momentum going its important that we consistently put partnerships and score runs thats where the difference would be

5367800 after a three year campaign rights groups claimed victory over a way of life that they said cut the girls off from their own families sometimes involved ritual scarring and occasionally led to sexual abuse but it took some intense lobbying of political and religious authorities in this small west african state and it would seem the voodoo divinities to get there voodoo priests say that several hundred young girls are baptised every year as voodoo adepts or voodoosi after lengthy initiation rites of between three months and two years under the old system instead of rejoining their families after these ceremonies they had to stay at voodoo convents to serve the gods

5367884 once the weather improved in mid june garaventa made progress extremely fast
5367885 its been going at a rapid pace ever since everything is on schedule
5367886 its going to be even more of an icon than it was before
5367887 everyone will know where you mean when you say meet ya at the clock tower its gonna be big
5367888 theres no crane or all terrain forklift to help build it
5367889 so crews used the needle crane which is run by three or four winches on a plate at the base of a tower once it gets too high for the needle crane crews hoist the crane itself on top of the tower and the new tower supports the needle crane and thus its a longer method but when you cant get there by vehicle its your only alternative
5367890 crane operator hans berghart from squaw valley drove the crane into the exposed area to drag off the old saddles
5367891 were trying to keep it natural while also making it more user friendly
5367892 and were trying to keep up with garaventas pace theyre sticking to the schedule and we are too they dont mess around
5367893 growing from humble beginnings on the streets of san francisco to a lifestyle brand in a few short years is remarkable each year we strive to build on the success of previous icer air events and were very excited about future plans for a multi city esurance icer air tour starting in 2009
5367894 esurance is again thrilled to be the title sponsor of such a great event our partnership with icer air has produced some great results and were proud to help make such a signature event possible
5367895 were very excited about the evolution of the event and the upcoming tour because esurance is committed to helping our large sponsorships get even greener were also very enthusiastic about the green aspects of esurance icer air 2008
5367896 ive always loved sports i used to be on a track team in school and thats probably why i can think to myself now yeah i can do this which is totally crazy the team was a big part of my life back then and taught me so many things
5367897 when i look back on my life and what im able to do its partly because of that early training it taught me discipline how to be committed about striving to win stamina all that good stuff
5367898 i dont expect to win this race my goal is to finish
5367899 ill probably end up crawling across the finish line but ill do it
5367900 come to me all of you who are weary and find life burdensome and i will refresh you take my yoke upon your shoulders and learn from me for i am gentle and humble of heart your soul will find rest for my yoke is easy and my burden light

5367902 i can only say the wild went to speak to him and were very respectful and shared information with him about himself and the organization and their vision
5367903 i think it was a very intelligent move on their behalf to involve him but we dont have any set plans to talk
5367904 marian has really enjoyed his career with the wild its been a great organization for him and hes blossomed into a spectacular player under their guidance
5367905 i can tell you that no decision about free agency has been made and that hes not even thinking about it hes focused on coming in and having a great season if you start talking about next year i think youre getting ahead of yourself like this story

5367919 bo would not have thrown away an expensive ivory handle for the sake of a little mistake like this
5367920 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5367921 there can be no excuse for storing the dna of innocent adults let alone children who are entirely blameless
5367922 i just want you to know that when we talk about war were really talking about peace
5367923 those who have nothing to hide have nothing to fear
5367924 it feels great to be a parent of this young man
5367925 since the september 16 2007 incident we have said that based on statements of company personnel who were directly involved we believe those involved acted appropriately
5367926 if it is determined that an individual acted improperly blackwater would support holding that person accountable but at this stage without being able to review evidence collected in an ongoing investigation we will not prejudge the actions of any individual
5367927 if the charge sticks then he will be thrown out of the sumo association
5367928 one of the problems as i see it is that he went up too quickly
5367929 to starving children trying to look as if they give a crap about humanity
5367930 ive bought a couple of those houses already that hes building you can build a house for 150 000 103 000 which is amazing
5367931 so i bought two of them and plan on buying more as theyre doing an amazing thing there
5367932 there is a tendency to make fun of people who get involved in these sorts of things
5367933 through the energy efficiency program proposed in our application i believe we can begin to create a blueprint for a sustainable energy future
5367934 they are for feathering utility company profits we want real energy efficiency and real energy savings
5367935 the air is very big think of a motorway youve got a car travelling at 80mph in the fast lane and one doing the same on the other side theres not much distance between them in the air if you were that close wed be very concerned
5367936 there are different levels but somewhere like coventry where yesterdays crash occurred will have an air traffic control and youd generally expect most aircraft to be in contact if youre taking off you might pre book
5367937 not every aircraft has a radio its not a requirement although a lot of them will have a hand held radio because they like to know whats going on overall its a very well proven safe regime
5367938 all the designs have to be approved and the build quality has to be to a very high level of airworthiness everyone who flies is really concerned about safety
5367939 a large number of soldiers have deployed more than twice with that i feel that well have a very successful mission
5367940 were just so glad to move on to the next station
5367941 we emphasize the critical thought process they think outside the box and consider different impacts
5367942 there were a number of names that popped up on the battle roster that had legitimate reasons for not going so theyre not going
5367943 at first i thought id have pants underwear on for the scene apparently not
5367944 but ive sort of done that before on stage its all old hat now really

5367947 de belangrijkste hinderpaal op de weg naar de democratie in pakistan is verwijderd

5367949 an absence of african culture in american festivals and cultural productions as a whole
5367950 and has given some indication that he intends to commit suicide in the plane
5367951 it has come to our attention that representatives of hamed ehadadi an iranian basketball player may be contacting nba teams to discuss the possibility of signing mr ehadadi to an nba player contract
5367952 we have been advised that a federal statue prohibits a person or organization in the united states from engaging in business dealings with iranian nationals

5367963 the only gold medal that really matters to me is
5367964 i sincerely want to fuck the taste out of your mouth
5367965 you shot your mouth off and i showed you what that hole was for
5367966 it might not be a great fit but its better than being closed for four days
5367967 the brits have set the standard as we did four years ago
5367968 what theyve done has just been incredible and great to watch theyve really made the other countries sit up and rethink the way that we do things ive not been surprised at what theyve done here they put a structure in place in 1998 and the progression since then has been a real credit to them
5367969 its not just about the money money is a part of it but its more about the fantastic environment the british have set up for their athletes
5367970 i honestly believe that that even if their budget was half that amount they would still get results because of the people working within their system and the way theyre going about it
5367971 i know they have a very good budget but the way that they manage that money is a big credit to them they have a base in manchester that they use as a centre point and the access they have to riders is something that we struggle to have
5367972 britain will be in a very good part of that cycle in four years time and london is obviously a big objective for them
5367973 at this stage its shit or bust just a medal wont do tomorrow now its got to be gold at this late stage
5367974 we wanted to push the danes and make them crack a bit because we didnt think theyd be able to go as fast as they did yesterday
5367975 we went out even faster than wed planned and after that we managed to hold it catching them and seeing them in front of us over the last six laps spurred us on and hence the time it was just a question of holding that speed and getting the changes right
5367976 we expected to win but its a relief to actually do it and finish the job when youre under a bit of pressure we didnt know how much more the danes had and i wasnt my usual self yesterday i was a bit tired but tomorrow i pulled up really well and was back to my usual self
5367977 the madison is the hardest of the lot you can be the strongest yet have a crash early on but well be strong were the world champions for me the big pressure events are over well enjoy it tomorrow
5367978 i enjoyed the individual pursuit win for about half an hour but then the medal went in the drawer and i was thinking what a huge disappointment it would be if we didnt win tonight even though i had one gold
5367979 all the way along the focus has been on three gold medals if chris and i had come away from here with one each wed probably have been quite disappointed i suppose you do get a bit greedy
5367980 not at all actually i was a bit fed up with him because he woke me up this morning messing around in the apartment he was running round like a schoolkid hes up for it
5367981 the quality of the education they provide and how much their students achieve
5367982 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
5367983 when the green capitol initiative hit it gave us the wind at our backs to carry the initiative through
5367984 your organization needs to have achieved a certain level of maturity or be designed from the ground up as a virtual environment or youre going to hit a lot of pain points
5367985 to get the full benefits of high availability and resource allocation nmci needed to become 100 percent storage dependent
5367986 in our initial deployment we went from zero san storage to 30 terabytes this is a major cost that can come back to bite you if youre not prepared for it
5367987 youve got to make sure your people understand the implications of operating in a virtualized environment
5367988 servers are no longer something you can just reach out and touch now there are 300 to 400 server administrators who also need to change their way of thinking
5367989 im very happy that you can ask that question very very happy and i hope it gets asked a lot
5367990 my friends we spent 3 million of your money to study the dna of bears in montana now i dont know if that was a paternity issue or a criminal issue but the point is it was 3 million of your money
5367991 using glib generalizations to try and win votes isnt straight talk its misleading and its political pandering of the worst sort
5367992 the good work being done in montana should save taxpayers money and senator mccains total lack of understanding of important issues that folks here care about proves just how out of touch he is
5367993 the insinuation from the obama campaign that john mccain a former prisoner of war cheated is outrageous
5367994 she left me alone claiming wed run out of things to fight about i was crushed of course but at least ive something i can write about
5367995 you always get under my skin i dont find it irritating you always play to win i dont need rehabilitating
5367996 time for decisions to be made crack up in the sun lose it in the shade
5367997 come on and do your thing come on and make it go sometimes it feels like rain
5367998 i have died for a thousand years tasted salt of a thousand tears and your kiss was almost gold
5367999 and if this sounds like goodbye then you hear the same as me
5368000 loving you was flying in the dark loving you was dancing in the minedfields all alone
5368001 fall into you is all i seem to do when i hit the bottle cos im afraid to be alone
5368002 when you motor away beyond the once red lips when you free yourself from the chance of a lifetime you can be anyone they told you to
5368003 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5368004 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5368005 following msnbcs lead in abandoning non partisan coverage of the presidential race

5368010 were mad as hell and were not going to take it anymore
5368011 ideal for when you feel like shouting but know that speaking softly is more likely to do the trick or the perfect gift for the loud one in your life
5368012 the bottom line is that u s families raising children with disabilities are reporting severe hardships at rates that are chilling including families that are solidly middle class
5368013 we were shocked to find such high rates of hardship among upper income families
5368014 these results suggest that state and federal policies that are in place to help families with disabled children are not going nearly far enough
5368015 they are not eliminating deprivation and these findings are particularly troubling now when the nations economy is struggling families raising children with disabilities are likely to be hardest hit during this economic downturn
5368016 these families struggle to provide adequate care for their disabled children
5368017 the buildings style inside and out is hybrid almost a pastiche offering tudor byzantine and gothic elements modern but not modernist
5368018 academic but clear enlivened by her interest in the cultural moment
5368019 it appears that several milf sub commanders are not controlled by the milf leadership and just using the peace process as a blanket to launch violent attacks against the people of mindanao
5368020 we are taking military action to stop these atrocities perpetrated by the milf
5368021 clear manifestation of the insincerity to the peace process of a significant portion of the milf
5368022 our leadership has not sanctioned these attacks this has to stop if we can confirm the involvement of our forces
5368023 they have taken over the business center the rural banks pawnshops
5368024 all of us are praying here in the room we are all scared
5368025 i hope something should be done to end this crisis a lot of innocent people are becoming victims of this situation
5368026 pursuit operations are ongoing they still have hostages with them
5368027 the strikes will be on confirmed areas where milf members are concentrated the areas are determined by troops on the ground its going to be a well coordinated air strike operation to minimize collateral damage
5368028 i know that earlier this year senator obama proposed cutting the nasa budget and delaying the timetable for our return to the moon and the mars mission
5368029 in this market unless i have a reason to think a movie like this is going to be a slam dunk im not going to take a flyer on it even with heath ledger
5368030 im always challenging myself and seeing what i can do
5368031 but im a good athlete my stamina i can get that up there if i really try
5368032 i like getting a lot of time with the babies
5368033 when i flail about its fun because of the freedom when youre doing steps like this its to do something well
5368034 consider all alternatives that will maximize value to our stockholders
5368035 our interpretation is this is great news for a deal getting done
5368036 both management teams are getting back together theyre moving beyond the hostility
5368037 were not worried about it weve seen this movie before
5368038 we dont want people to focus on the exact track this is a broad really diffuse storm all the florida keys and all the florida peninsula are going to feel the effects of this storm no matter where the center makes landfall
5368039 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor
5368040 i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously
5368041 everybody seems to be acting like this is a non event
5368042 the new challenge we have is that for approximately five years the plan which is a very bad plan but is the only plan that nasa and the administration and congress have approved is to be dependent on the russian soyuz vehicle to get people to and from the international space station
5368043 and so now with the political realities with russia invading georgia we have a new wrinkle thrown in
5368044 i hope the nation and the people will forgive my mistakes
5368045 today the shadow of dictatorship that has prevailed for long over this country that chapter has been closed
5368046 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5368047 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5368048 i pray the government stops this downward slide and takes the country out of this crisis
5368049 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5368050 that is a decision that has to be taken by the democratic leadership
5368051 the whole idea was lets be so unbelievably diversified that we wont be affected but when the credit markets seize up no matter what kind of financial company you are everything seizes up
5368052 the ubs statement basically shows the model is a failure
5368053 concept behind the creation of jpmorgan chase has broken down
5368054 no steel company can sell steel when auto manufacturers arent selling cars and no bank can make big profits when theres a weakness in the housing and credit markets

5368389 i maintain they were as important to the st lawrence iroquois for food as sure as any fish was to north american natives
5368390 the neat thing about it is there is only one fish that was raised to clan status by the st lawrence iroquois and that was the eel
5368391 if you go to oneida lake in the united states now and ask first nations people what clan they belong to a lot of them are from the eel clan

5368440 water arouses passions because it can be used as a weapon a political weapon just as oil is a political weapon
5368441 its incomprehensible that in one country there is an excess of water in one place and a deficit in another
5368442 even more incomprehensible is that they expect us to use water from desalination plants which is expensive and would force us to raise prices
5368443 in this plant alone we are talking about solar energy providing about one million kilowatt hours kwh a year against the total consumption of 180 million kwh ie less than 0
5368444 you must not leave the tap on for too long because water will be wasted and we wont have enough water in barcelona
5368445 if you want to shower in hot water then you must collect the cold water that comes out first in a bucket and use it later to water the plants
5368446 if you dont have water there are lots of things you cant do you cant live without it without water we cant survive

5368453 so youll see a difference in vocals a little bit more personality and its definitely a sensual album
5368454 i definitely think that when i first heard the song from the beginning of the record you kind of feel like you know im leaving it up to you
5368455 and by the time it gets to the second verse and makes it to the end of the song it just feels like im saying i dont want to put up with it anymore
5368456 it was a great first single for me because it said something i fell in love with records like beyonc s irreplaceable where you could emotionally attach yourself to the record as soon as you heard it
5368457 i didnt want something so vague and so clubby because i wanted people to see me as a woman with something to say
5368458 i would say that an official girl is someone in a relationship
5368459 youre attentive youre honest but at the same time you can let go a little bit
5368460 has it come to this has the magical impact of george lucas original vision of star wars been reduced to the level of saturday morning animation
5368461 its a deadening film that cuts corners on its animation and slumbers through a plot that a makes us feel like weve seen it all before and b makes us wish we hadnt
5368462 we saw this in a theater full of kids and there wasnt a single moment that caused spontaneous cheering
5368463 ziro the hutt is perhaps the most bizarre character ever created in the series history yes including jar jar a jabba shaped slug who wears face paint and feathers the creature speaks english rather than huttese except that he she somehow has the accent of truman capote by way of eric cartman of south park
5368464 i found it impossible to concentrate on much of anything she he was saying except to imagine that all of this would one day make for a great book entitled in cold hutt naturally
5368465 the character was so bad so incredibly awful that it was a slap to the face it is many times worse than im actually describing this character was actually too much for me
5368466 after meeting ahsoka we really understand why he killed all the younglings id have done it with my bare hands she calls him skyguy which is amazingly annoying and he calls her snips
5368467 of course the anakin ahsoka relationship is made impossibly awkward by the fact that shes half naked and 12 and that theyre always in close quarters i dont need the force to see this fan fiction coming

5368470 emis relationship with 30 seconds to mars has been extremely rewarding and successful for both the band and the company
5368471 the hard work of emis global team and of the band has resulted in sales of 3 million albums and singles multiple awards and a growing global fanbase however we have been forced to take procedural legal steps in order to protect emis investment and rights during contract renegotiations initiated by the band and management we hope to resolve these matters amicably and put them behind us so we can continue working in partnership with the band to take them to even greater levels of success
5368472 we had been signed to our record contract for nine years
5368473 basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than seven years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5368474 we have been sued by the corporation quite simply because roughly 45 days ago we exercised our legal right to terminate our old out of date contract which according to the law is null and void
5368475 we terminated for a number of reasons which we wont go into here
5368476 the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt
5368477 so we have lost many of the people that were near and dear to us at virgin emi and crucial to the success of 30 seconds to mars a few of the great ones are still there but it is hardly the same company we have known

5368483 malgr toutes les annonces gouvernementales une fois de plus ce sont les familles qui font les frais de la politique actuelle
5368484 gee it was really easy my grad school professor passed my manuscript along to an agent there was a bidding war then a year later it was on the shelves
5368485 the historical data tell us clearly dont get too used to commodity export booms
5368486 as any third world country will tell you they tend to go away pretty quickly
5368487 is that we have been able to greatly increase corn exports while also using it for ethanol only by increasing the acreage devoted to corn have we been able to do this and by squeezing down the use of corn for domestic livestock feed
5368488 we have achieved a worldwide manufacturing base and we are not going to shut down our factories overseas
5368489 but on the margin we will shift a little bit of manufacturing back to the united states
5368490 which means we are looking to set up shop there
5368491 we were in a situation where there wasnt enough corn in the world to go around
5368492 i think the important thing is for everyone to understand that the purpose of a registry is not to prevent communication but to provide transparency
5368493 and i aint no preacher but heres my erick sermon
5368494 so eat this black music and tell me how it tastes now and f jesse jackson cause it aint about race now
5368495 walk through the gates of hell see my impala parked in front with the high beams on me and the devil sharin chronic blunts listening to pictures of don imus for target practice
5368496 i know obama would but would hillary take part i feel the pain of nelson mandela cause when it rains it pours i need rihannas umbrella for coretta scott kings teardrops when she got the phone call that the future just took a f ing headshot
5368497 i wonder why jesse jackson aint catch him before his body dropped

5368501 honey he no longer wants to be intimate with you
5368502 i turned to my dad and said dad we got the same score he looked up and said oh yeah we started getting a little confused
5368503 its not correct i believe its correct to have two gold medals
5368504 but this is my modest opinion the ioc is different
5368505 im not sure if anybody understands what the hell is going on
5368506 it wasnt like i got second by three tenths or five tenths i had the same score thats what makes it a little harder to take
5368507 in other sports like track and field its all timed and it doesnt have anything to do with judging you do your routine and you turn it over to the judges thats what weve been going through our entire lives and weve come to accept it
5368508 shes an excellent athlete no matter how old she is
5368509 shes done her hard work and her preparation she definitely deserved her gold medal
5368510 i play by the rules so in my opinion i have to say yes
5368511 judges have their own opinion and once you land your dismount theres nothing else you can do
5368512 i have the most important medal and its the all around gold
5368513 i have four medals now and im tied with my dad one gold two silvers and a bronze and i have one more chance to get one gold that i feel like i missed out on today
5368514 getting back seeing my dog seeing my cars and setting up my new house
5368515 ive had a fantastic relationship with our club our people its been great and its been 12 years now that ive been at the club ever since it opened its door
5368516 i understand times come in football and if the club decides its time to go and its not for me theyll look around and ill look around and thats where it is
5368517 but my choice if you ask me is to stay here and get the club back to where id like to see it at the top of the ladder
5368518 its really entirely up to the club when the contract is negotiated
5368519 ive got another year of my contract to go and over the last 12 years three of them weve finished top and weve won a premiership they never negotiated my contract any time prior to that the end of the existing deal so i cant imagine they would do it now
5368520 our players have some experience theyve got a little older the results might not show that but certainly we dont think were as bad as the position on the ladder is
5368521 but were not going to complain and say anything about that its only up to us to prove that from now on
5368522 the contrast between the sides was massive new zealand are nothing special they hardly offered anything in attack and dan carter
5368523 late last year and early this year we probably had a few issues but i dont think discipline has been an issue with us over the last 15 weeks
5368524 hodgeys got about 90 i think ive got 90 for tripping so i guess it means you have to be a little bit more careful because youre going to get an extra week if you go up
5368525 but thats the whole point of the system youve got to be more careful
5368526 i guess the system is working if it stops us doing the wrong thing
5368527 the contrast between the sides was massive new zealand are nothing special they hardly offered anything in attack and dan carter
5368528 weve put a full stop today on the sonny bill williams file weve placed this chapter into the clubs history and archives
5368529 as far as im concerned the book on sonny bill williams is now closed
5368530 the clubs received a significant payout one of the biggest in the history of australian sport
5368531 im happy that weve got a full stop on it theres no winners in this saga
5368532 the bulldogs have lost a player theyve developed since the age of 16 one of the best players to come through our club the game has lost one of its significant profiles and for sonny bill himself hes made some decisions that hell have to live with for the rest of his life
5368533 theres no fairytale ending at the end of this theres no one running around the bulldogs club yelling and screaming with delight this is actually a relatively sad day
5368534 i was willing to go a lot more its all good 750 we can stop there
5368535 thats not our plan wed like to be able to spend that sort of money
5368536 theres no ready made fix to actually spend that money at the moment
5368537 the contrast between the sides was massive new zealand are nothing special they hardly offered anything in attack and dan carter
5368538 what is the value of eight golds in beijing before a prime time audience in the us

5368542 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5368543 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector
5368544 in effect the eu is taxing innovation a move that could impair continued technological development in the information technology industry and raise prices for millions of businesses and consumers
5368545 we regret that formal consultations have not been successful in resolving our concerns over the duties that the eu is imposing on several high tech products
5368546 we believe that these duties are inconsistent with the eus commitments on these products and that they discourage technological innovation in the it sector

5368549 the first rochester indie fest is just a taste of what this event can become in the next few years
5368550 were modeling this on austin tx s famous south by southwest fest and rochester fits the criteria potential audience numbers venues within walking distance and a strong pop rock indie musician base
5368551 even though were starting small with one night at one venue well have two stages featuring six acts in six hours
5368552 as an employer i realize how important it is to stop the so called brain drain in this area
5368553 rif can be an important part of promoting rochester to our next generation of professionals and leaders
5368554 an educated person is one who has learned that information almost always turns out to be at best incomplete and very often false misleading fictitious mendacious just dead wrong
5368555 we see the ftc as absolutely critical but the states should be partners in this as well
5368556 if we had all hands on deck we could really make some progress in addressing this problem
5368557 there must be a recognition that online fraud is a huge threat to consumers as well as a threat to online commerce
5368558 i said wait a minute hold on this is the stupidest idea ive ever heard
5368559 he stiller said i know isnt it great i thought in the right context it could be entertaining or disastrous theres that thing of the risk factor for any creative idea or any venture the only difference being that i had a lot of goodwill from iron man and i was just apprehensive to not squander it
5368560 that was my fear my fear is going oh something is going to change that look you deal with sensitive topics whether youre in a comedic context or not nowadays its just you know its very very very convenient to pick things apart
5368561 i remember coming up watching comedies like this things that were really off kilter and really largely in poor taste but still made by people that we knew
5368562 my response to that its interesting because at different phases i can have different takes on it one is like well isnt that the whole idea the country is based on we can express this and that its all kind of business as usual its strange to me were taking flack from a disabilities support group with all the other archetypes and stereotypes

5368567 the results of this study are interesting however we already know that type 2 diabetes can be undetected for up to 12 years before it is diagnosed therefore although the study measures the effect of early weight loss for four years from the point of diagnosis we cant be certain how long participants actually had the condition before they began the study it is possible that those who benefited most from the effects of weight loss soon after being diagnosed had only recently developed type 2 diabetes an early diagnosis gave them the best chance of effectively controlling it and reducing their risk of serious complications
5368568 equally those who did not benefit as much from early weight loss may have had the progressive condition for longer which could have made it more challenging to control
5368569 maintaining a healthy weight is key to good diabetes control eating a healthy balanced diet and taking regular physical activity is the best way of doing this poorly controlled diabetes increases the risk of serious complications such as heart disease stroke kidney failure blindness and amputation
5368570 we have people coming to give information about windmills because it is a very important issue here right now the presenters will take about half an hour each and then there will be a question period but it wont turn into a debate
5368571 i kind of look at it like a grass fire
5368572 ten years ago it started in hillier and then it moved to royal road and that is still before the ontario municipal board then a couple of years ago we hear about trillium power and their plans to erect a large number of turbines in lake ontario and then we hear nothing now gilead power and skypower want to develop wind farms i would think this is just the first of a number of public meetings so hopefully people with questions will get the answers they are looking for

5368578 tandbergs strategic value as the leading player in a rapidly growing niche positions the company as an attractive acquisition target
5368579 we would not rule out industrial players entering the scene
5368580 many of the financial shareholders who have been shareholders for some time view tandberg as undervalued and expect a realistic bid to be a great deal above the current share price
5368581 if you feel safe if youre expecting help to come and you feel comfortable and safe

5368583 im amazed that so many athletes are wearing a fabric i tested in a laboratory in hampton virginia
5368584 what we look at are concepts for reducing drag on otherwise smooth surfaces this is more directed toward fundamental physics the interactions between the flow and the surface
5368585 we evaluated the surface roughness effects of nearly 60 fabrics or patterns in one of our small low speed wind tunnels
5368586 we were assessing which fabrics and weaves had the lowest drag the tests have generally shown the smoother the fabric the lower the drag
5368587 the fabric comes in the form of fabric tubes a small diameter fabric tube
5368588 we pull that over our smooth flat model which is an aluminum plate underneath we prepare the edges so theyre straight and square with no protruding corners or edges to interfere with the drag on the surface
5368589 our match earlier this year in riyadh demonstrated the passion our saudi fans have for manchester united

5368649 the primary is the place where you take stock and say are there any surprises there
5368650 we have to be more thoughtful in terms of how we spend it and more effective
5368651 it is a quiet start to the week for the markets in terms of economic data and indeed for the week as a whole things could be relatively patchy which should mean little prospect of a re think in terms of the interest rate outlook in developed markets
5368652 currency players are still factoring in how bad the european economy will be
5368653 there can be no safe haven for terrorists who threaten the american people
5368654 i have long said that the central terrorist threat to the united states lies in northwest pakistan and afghanistan and not iraq
5368655 a year ago i advocated that the us move from a musharraf policy to a pakistan policy
5368656 pakistan is a critical theater in countering the threat of al qaeda and violent islamic extremism and i look forward to the government increasing its future cooperation
5368657 the situation in pakistans frontier regions requires immediate and continued attention and i hope that the elections for president musharrafs successor will serve to reconcile the pakistani people behind a leader who can solidify their government internally
5368658 it is critical that the united states continue to work in partnership with the pakistani people and their democratically elected government to tackle the many challenges we both face
5368659 in matters of national security good judgement will be at a premium in the term of the next president as we were all reminded 10 days ago by events in the nation of georgia
5368660 it was a moment when political self interest and the national interest parted ways
5368661 for my part with so much in the balance it was an easy call as i said at the time i would rather lose an election than lose a war
5368662 even in retrospect obama would chose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5368663 all his bluster distortions and negative attacks notwithstanding it is hard to understand how senator mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5368664 the difference in this race is that john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion dollars a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5368665 toss the bums out were starting from scratch were starting over

5368671 it doesnt allow drilling off california or the eastern coast of florida the democrat staff said
5368672 if speaker pelosi and her democratic colleagues were truly serious about increasing production of american energy and lowering the price of gasoline they would call congress back into session immediately to vote on our all of the above energy plan rather than taking a five week break away from washington while the speaker now claims to embrace a comprehensive energy plan that includes more conservation more innovation and more american energy production the fact is her new effort appears to be just another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5368673 america can achieve true greatness when we work together to make certain that every voice in america is a voice that will be heard
5368674 pelosi is definitely hearing voices mostly from panicked dems looking at the poll numbers on drilling but will that lead to a vote
5368675 another flawed plan that will do little to lower gas prices
5368676 we had been signed to our record contract for 9 years basically under california law where we live and signed our deal one cannot be bound to a contract for more than 7 years this is widely known by all the record companies and has been for years in fact so aware of it are they that they desperately try to make deals outside of california whenever possible
5368677 it is a law that protects people from lengthy unfair career spanning contracts this law also gave us the legal right to explore other possible opportunities
5368678 if you think the fact that we have sold in excess of 2 million records and have never been paid a penny is pretty unbelievable well so do we
5368679 and the fact that emi informed us that not only arent they going to pay us at all but that we are still 1 4 million dollars in debt to them is even crazier
5368680 that the next record we make will be used to pay off that old supposed debt just makes you start wondering what is going on shouldnt a record company be able to turn a profit from selling that many records or at the very least break even we think so

5368689 but i do think it could be bad for track cycling if it gets worse than this one or two medals each race could be bad i think interest could fall
5368690 we have a world cup in copenhagen in two years time and if one country is too dominant it could decrease interest maybe
5368691 in denmark we only have money to try to make success in the team pursuit that went well but we were still beaten by seven seconds they are number one by far the funding is too far ahead for almost all nations i think nobody can match the funding

5368703 alcohol is present in many cases of domestic violence so it is extremely positive to see agencies addressing this in partnership
5368704 the benefit of this campaign is that it provides options and support for both victims and perpetrators with domestic violence and alcohol abuse
5368705 victims of domestic violence live in constant fear being controlled and threatened by their abusers the very essence of domestic violence is control in this context alcohol should not be used as an excuse for physical psychological or sexual abuse

5368740 painstakingly created his public persona to be that of a major drug dealer and gangster but is in reality a former correctional officer

5368748 a faithful catholic would have to ask should one rank the biological manner of jesus conception as a truth god wanted put into the sacred writings for the sake of our salvation
5368749 for the sake of our salvation vatican ii and biblical inerrancy
5368750 since therefore all that the inspired authors or sacred writers affirm must be held as affirmed by the holy spirit we must acknowledge that by means of the books of scripture the truth that god wanted recorded for our salvation in the form of the sacred writings is taught firmly faithfully and without error
5368751 although all parts of sacred scripture are divinely inspired quamvis omnes sacrae scripturae partes divinitus inspiratae sint inerrancy applies only to that truth which god wanted to put into sacred writings for the sake of salvation dv 11
5368752 in virtue of the charism of inspiration the holy spirit constitutes the books of the bible as the word of god and entrusts them to the church so that they might be received in the obedience of faith
5368753 well i guess i just never met my miss right i guess ive been looking for the perfect girl

5368775 the first thing to keep in mind is that we have some semantic confusion as is usual at this stage of a new market around just what is a cloud
5368776 ibm has finally enunciated a vision for its cloud computing that makes sense for ibm and its customers it offers a very high end version of cloud computing virtually unlimited amounts of power up to and including mainframe systems backed by its
5368777 ibm actually offers even more choices that may be less obvious
5368778 it was reported last week that microsoft is moving to the cloud
5368779 microsoft has other online perhaps cloud services such as its live services and new live mesh service for synchronizing devices of every kind it is also testing a consumer version of office that will combine a basic version of desktop office with an array of online services
5368780 last friday i spoke with workday a saas erp company ive been tracking since its start
5368781 you can access a cloud as pure computing power a place to load an application that needs lots of computing or requires cyclical peaks
5368782 you can find a cloud that provides a platform with apis to support an ecosystem of isvs who provide software that you find appealing
5368783 you can choose a cloud whose platform includes an application salesforce com that attracts other isvs to surround it
5368784 you can simply find a saas vendor whose application is appealing you dont care about the cloud behind it just the application
5368785 you can build your own cloud managed by a vendor or your own it staff for some large scale purpose
5368786 and no doubt someone somewhere is dreaming up some other things to do with clouds
5368787 a messy period with many clouds many of them not interoperable because theyre not build to the same standards
5368788 a period of consolidation because we really want to buy our applications in a way that they can be aware of each other and use them in a common environment
5368789 a higher level of standardization where just as we do on the internet today any application can be used with any other application on the platform and through the portal of your choice

5368792 in maine traditional methods of restoring atlantic salmon by stocking fish have not been very successful with only 0 68 per cent returning
5368793 with the tagged salmon we can track more fish further into the ocean than ever before and get meaningful results
5368794 were not sure where they go in between but were hoping to find that out
5368795 the salmon crossing the line is evidence that the network is working
5368796 given the fact that we are looking for a fish that is still less than a foot long that could be anywhere in the northwest atlantic ocean finding them in such apparent concentrations hundreds of miles from brewer maine is remarkable and very encouraging
5368797 broad scale ocean arrays such as the otn halifax line are a great tool to examine the marine ecology of such an uncommon fish in a large marine environment
5368798 salmon are an iconic fish but theyre becoming endangered and people want to know whats happening to the population
5368799 this is the first step to finding out where in the ocean the salmon are dying and whats causing the decline
5368800 actually i dont really know how i got the nickname

5368812 the militants believe that the shiite officials are from the badr militia who are trained and strongly directed by iran with of course the knowledge of the americans
5368813 the militants now sahwa members kept blocking import of goods from iran
5368814 they shot the shopkeepers who dealt with them so it was rare to see iranian chocolate or anything else with the partial government control by the shiite especially in the last six months shopkeepers are now allowed to deal in iranian goods
5368815 if the us launches an assault on iran ill be the first volunteer to fight on the side of the us
5368816 iran enjoys influence through the men of the united iraqi alliance in the baghdad government as represented by the supreme islamic iraqi council siic and the dawa party
5368817 the governor made a deal to import cooking oil from iran at a very high price that has never been seen before
5368818 i think the iranian influence will remain as long as there are such men as the governor raad rashid jawad in the province
5368819 the province was and still is the worst because of this corrupt administration
5368820 the iraqi government gives 5 million dollars per month to the iranian side to cover the cost of the electricity to diyala province

5368822 the intention was to manipulate the numbers that we get when we get our information and data off the dyno
5368823 that was a really poor foolish decision on the part of our key guys
5368824 a couple guys chose to make a decision there that really impacts all of us
5368825 i know they were probably frustrated from the standpoint that wanting to show that hey we have less horsepower than ever before and they wanted to make it look like were handicapped even more than we actually were
5368826 the engine shop thats kind of a badge of honor you win that engine dyno good for you thats kind of how we felt in the past few years and mark cronquist and those guys really feel like they want to win that thing
5368827 the way i look at it to come back after youve been chopped to come back and win it again thats awesome
5368828 thats a great story that wasnt able to be told
5368829 i anticipate that we havent seen the end of it yet
5368830 well figure out exactly what happened and those that were responsible
5368831 theres going to be punishment for that thats just part of life you cant do that
5368832 if this alleged incident proves true it goes against everything we stand for as an organization
5368833 we will take full responsibility and accept any penalties nascar levies against us
5368834 i was surprised to see what was happening and astonished and frankly incredulous
5368835 i couldnt believe it was happening because its clearly defined in the entry forms that you dont do this sort of thing but im sure joe and j d will take care of that internally and whatever fans think theyre going to think were just going to keep working on our stuff
5368836 its not something that you like to hear about and you have to just question every chassis dyno thats ever been run on every toyota
5368837 i dont know is if its a toyota problem if its a joe gibbs thing how widespread is it and how long has it been going on
5368838 its disappointing to hear that anybody whether its a manufacturer or a team or an individual on a team would go to any length to do that its bad for the entire garage i think
5368839 if theyre going to make decisions based on parity after theyve given toyota what theyve given them with regard to parameters on their engine based on flawed data that a team or the manufacturer one of the other had kited or shaved that certainly is detrimental to my interests
5368840 we might roll down the shutters we got built in generators

5368869 the obama people must feel that he didnt do quite as well as they might have wanted to in that context because what they are putting out privately is that mccain may not have been in the cone of silence and may have had some ability to overhear what the questions were to obama
5368870 the level of objectivity at nbc news has fallen so low that reporters are now giving voice to unsubstantiated partisan claims in order to undercut john mccain
5368871 mitchell did what has become a pattern for her of simply repeating obama campaign talking points
5368872 mccain was in a motorcade to the event and then held in a green room with no broadcast feed
5368873 mitchell is repeating uncritically a completely unsubstantiated obama campaign claim that john mccain somehow cheated
5368874 instead of trying to substantiate this blatant falsehood in any way andrea mitchell felt that she needed to repeat it on air to millions
5368875 we as a campaign have not said anything about it though the mccain folks do seem pretty sensitive on the point
5368876 he made time to go to the gym but canceled a visit with wounded troops
5368877 obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him i was there i can vouch for that
5368878 it just seems inexplicable that this whole thing has been such an issue but clearly the mccain campaign wants this to be an issue wants to paint him as someone whos unfeeling about the troops

5368887 marshall called his microscope the great double microscope for two reasons he wanted to illustrate the large size of the microscope and to reinforce the fact that it was a compound microscope
5368888 one of the most significant features of marshalls microscope was the fine focus mechanism which was a very unique design element for the period the mechanism functioned through a series of sleeves that attached the microscope body to the limb one sleeve served to attach and adjust the position of the body tube to the limb while the other moved the body tube up and down with a small focusing knob
5368889 simultaneously a fellow of the society of antiquaries and the royal society baker was a naturalist whose microscopical observations of aquatic animals and fossils were of interest to a wide audience in 1744 his study of crystal morphology garnered baker the copley gold medal for his microscopical work and inspired other scientists to engage in systematic microscopic studies of crystalline formations many of the materials he examined were observed through a compound microscope made by the english optics expert john cuff 1708 1772 which he designed at bakers behest
5368890 the works of nature are the only source of true knowledge and the study of them the most noble employment of the mind of man microscopes furnish us as it were with a new sense unfolding the amazing operations of nature and presenting us with wonders unthought of by former ages
5368891 louis joblot 1645 1723 a professor of mathematics at the royal academy of painting and sculpture in paris combined his interest in science and art through the use of a microscope beginning in 1716 he devoted most of his career to exposing the wonders of the microscopic world although not published until 1754 the illustrations and text for his observations on natural history made with the microscope were completed thirty six years earlier
5368892 joblots instruments represented an advancement over those available before him because of the quality of the mechanisms permitting precise focusing the excellent design of his tubular diaphragms which eliminated stray light and the multitude of his well planned attachments for mounting the most diverse types of specimens

5368896 we will continue to work with the pakistani government and political leaders and urge them to redouble their focus on pakistans future and its most urgent needs including stemming the growth of extremism addressing food and energy shortages and improving economic stability
5368897 we have no comments to make on the resignation of president musharraf of pakistan
5368898 deeply concerned about this vacuum because it leaves the radical extremist outfits with freedom to do what they like not merely on the pakistan afghan border but clearly on our side of the border too
5368899 like nature abhors a vacuum we abhor the political vacuum that exists in pakistan it greatly worries us
5368900 the removal of musharraf would result in the military playing a more autonomous role on issues of relations with india including policies on kashmir support for the taleban and control over nuclear weapons

5368929 the concerns that amnesty international has mainly drawn from the fact that most of those that have been taken before the courts have alleged that theyve been tortured and that theyve been forced to confess and in certain of the instances a part of evidence that has been obtained through torture has actually been used in court and some of the individuals have also not been allowed to see their lawyers and in most cases theyve actually first seen their lawyers on the day of the hearing
5368930 were not saying they ought not try individuals against whom there is sufficient information that they may have committed offenses thats not what were saying but what were saying is if they are to proceed they must have information that is credible which must not have been obtained through torture and more importantly the court must have a basis in law and they must not under any circumstances pass the death penalty

5368988 audiences mayve been better served if they had the whole summer to play these tunes as they are made for driving with the windows down on a hot summer night either way previous academy is fans will surely dig the tunes but fast times is probably not the album that will see the band expand their scope too far out of the high school warped tour crowd

5369018 ive been in this business long enough to know that ive seen as many people die when i have a blob shaped asymmetric storm that they dismiss as not being very dangerous then they do the things that the governor has asked them not to do such as drive around in stormy weather go out on their boats go surfing go swimming go outside when power lines are down this system is dangerous if people dont do the common sense thing
5369019 we want every every floridian and guest to be a survivor as you know five people have lost their lives in this storm before it came to florida i know its only a tropical storm but we take it seriously

5369022 the potential is there again for tornados flooding and we have a small risk for some storm surge along the southwest florida coast particularly in collier county thats dependent upon where fay ends up moving and how strong the tropical storm gets over those warm waters of the florida straits

5369032 it was a good day of testing today after a great day of racing yesterday we have tested many different bridgestone tyres both front and rear and we have collected a lot of information which will help us for the rest of the season then we worked on some new electronics and mapping but we need to continue with this tomorrow because we havent finished the whole programme tomorrow we also have some general set up work to do to try some things that we werent able to check at the weekend due to losing one day to rain we hope that we will have another good day tomorrow finish all of our planned work and then we will leave here in good shape for the final push
5369033 today we concentrated on front tyres with michelin who provided us with some different compounds and rubber to try we found some improvement with regards to the wear of the tyre which was one of the biggest problems during the weekend but there is still a lot of work to do tomorrow we will shift focus to the rear tyre and we hope we can make the most of the day so that we can go to misano in better shape and with more confidence
5369034 it has been a really positive day we didnt have too much to test a couple of new tyres and thats about it but we managed to find a new setting to improve on what was already a very good situation i managed to drop my lap times by almost a second on yesterday and thats really positive unfortunately my physical condition on friday and the rain on saturday meant that we didnt head into the race in the best possible shape in any case im happy because the things weve improved today will be useful for the upcoming races hopefully the weathers good to us again tomorrow so we can finish the job off with bridgestone
5369035 today we worked mainly on trying to understand why i struggled so much at the start of the race yesterday my pace hasnt been particularly fast but im happy that it was consistent on both new and used tyres weve taken a step forward and well work hard tomorrow to take another one well probably modify the weight distribution a little to improve the overall feeling were working well and i can say that today has been a good day of tests
5369036 we tried some different front tyres that michelin brought here for this test but we finished after some laps because we couldnt find any improvement we tested the tyres with my current race bike there was no point using the machine with the pneumatic valve engine because the tyres werent working well enough we have rescheduled this test at misano on the monday after the san marino gp
5369037 today we tested some new steps in development concerning both engine and electronics in japan we are working on the development of both the spring valve engine and the pneumatic valve engine since my last appearance at the italian motogp i can say that the bike with pneumatic valve engine has improved a lot i think that the bike has reached a satisfactory level of development i hope that dani will be able to test it soon
5369038 the programme of the day test in the light of developments which occurred at the weekend was focused on the front rubber we have tried to collect the greatest amount of information possible to share with michelin the comparison with our technical partner should help us prepare for the next grand prix the weather conditions have helped us today and with a total of 40 laps with short and medium stints we managed to play out the full testing programme
5369039 today was a day mainly focused on research for a better performance from our rubber we have noted some progress but this is still not enough we expect michelin to work intensively to achieve the results we expect for the next race colin edwards has got a good lap time but only for three laps which is not significant enough for us to draw any conclusions we stayed out even longer to assess the durability of the tyres in addition to grip we were able also to do tests on electronics the next grand prix at misano i hope to take a good result in front of my home crowd

5369452 the ones who killed my husband they have money and they threw me in jail i am 100 per cent innocent i have no one no brother to look after me
5369453 there is a dangerous tendency to accept in afghanistan practices which would not be countenanced elsewhere because of cultural differences and local traditions

5369465 cbs asked us whos at the top of your dream list
5369466 without hesitation we said laurence fishburne he is a powerful and intense actor with an incredible range we had the opportunity to see mr fishburne in thurgood on broadway a few weeks ago and it was a truly profound experience the actor disappeared and thurgood marshall was standing there on the stage mr fishburne is also a talented writer and director if you distill csi down to its essence its a collaboration and we are so looking forward to collaborating with mr fishburne for all of us at csi this is truly a dream

5369478 even the families of prisoners dont usually accept their loved ones back when they are released from prison so having our members visit the prisoners in vaturekuka will slowly change the mindset of the community
5369479 we have to realize that hypoxia is not a local problem

5369510 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5369511 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory

5369569 lo que suceda en los pr ximos d as y meses determinar el futuro de las relaciones entre estados unidos y rusia pero del mismo modo mi opini n personal es que tienen que haber consecuencias para las acciones que rusia ha tomado contra un estado soberano
5369570 acuso al gobierno ruso de adoptar una pol tica de limpieza tnica y puedo probarlo con organizaciones internacionales que ya est n dando testimonio de lo que digo y recibimos 1 400 denuncias de ataques brutales asesinatos violaciones e internaci n de personas en violaci n de la convenci n de ginebra y del derecho humanitario internacional
5369571 como ya he dicho de acuerdo con el c digo de las naciones unidas estamos intentando imponer la paz a georgia que empez la agresi n consideramos que esta t ctica es muy efectiva y es la nica posible perm tanme recordarles que en la historia hemos visto muchos ejemplos de pacificaci n del agresor de esta manera los pa ses occidentales lo hicieron hace 70 a os y conocen las tr gicas consecuencias de eso quiero decir la lecci n del tratado de munich de 1938
5369572 rusia invadi un estado vecino soberano y amenaza a un gobierno democr tico electo por su pueblo
5369573 entendemos que el actual liderazgo de georgia es un proyecto especial de estados unidos pero un d a estados unidos tendr que elegir entre defender su prestigio por sobre un proyecto o una sociedad real que requiera acciones conjuntas
5369574 quiero dialogar con los rusos quiero que se retiren del territorio georgiano lo m s r pido posible y me interesa mantener buenas relaciones con rusia pero en el siglo xxi las naciones no invaden otras naciones
5369575 estamos sumamente decepcionados este informe aparentemente consiente el uso de la fuerza letal en una situaci n en la que los soldados no pod an y lo admiten estar seguros de lo que ten an frente creemos que hab a fundamentos suficientes para que se dieran cuenta que estaban frente a periodistas esto nos pone en una posici n en la que los periodistas no pueden levantar una c mara en presencia de los soldados israel es sin correr peligro de que les disparen eso es inaceptable y hablaremos con las autoridades israel es sobre c mo podemos mejorar la seguridad de nuestros periodistas en el futuro
5369576 el informe israel sobre el asesinato de fadel ha suscitado temores entre los periodistas palestinos que cubren el conflicto con israel en gaza entre los palestinos y los israel es en la franja de gaza sobre la misi n ustedes saben la misi n de cubrir y filmar y hemos estado escuchando comentarios de todos los otros colegas de que ya no est n seguros de sus vidas tras un informe como este que deja en claro que el simple hecho de levantar una c mara en la calle en un campo de refugiados o cerca de la frontera puede poner la vida de una persona en peligro
5369577 en este incidente del 16 de abril seis civiles fueron asesinados con proyectiles tipo flechette un arma ilegal que no deber a ser utilizada en estas condiciones en la franja de gaza y una de estas seis v ctimas era un periodista por todas estas razones era de esperarse que el ej rcito iniciara y dirigiera una investigaci n minuciosa sobre este caso pero decidi no hacerlo la falta de responsabilidad en este caso se refleja en la falta de responsabilidad en la muerte de miles de palestinos que fueron asesinados en los territorios ocupados

5369705 when you compare the faces and head shapes of children with specific types of autism to other children it is obvious there are variations currently autism diagnosis is purely behavior based and doctors use tape measurements to check for facial and brain dissimilarities we are developing a quantitative method that will accurately measure these differences and allow for earlier more precise detection of specific types of the disorder
5369706 once we have created a formula we can pre screen children by performing a quick non invasive scan of each childs face and brain to check for abnormalities early detection is crucial in treating children and preparing families
5369707 instead of looking at brain structures slice by slice in an mri magnetic resonance image we developed tools to create 3 d representations of the structures in order to visualize and make comparisons

5369794 as compared to prior years compensation committees generally spent a longer period of time deliberating the levels of bonus payments given the disparity in performance measured by shareholder value creation and bottom line financial operational results
5369795 the aggregate annual incentive increase of 9 6 across all four positions effectively mirrors the same level of ffo per share growth across all companies
5369796 as a whole the public real estate industry has consistently been ranked as having superior corporate governance practices and in terms of the compensation aspect of governance performance year 2007 was perhaps the first true test of pay for performance given last years mixed performance results
5369797 given that compensation was effectively flat between years suggests a strong correlation of pay for performance when factoring in both the strong financial operational performance and the weaker performance in total shareholder returns

5369810 la historia de la haza a m s importante y con justicia la m s renombrada de todas las realizadas por nuestra ciudad pero que no lleg hasta nosotros por el tiempo transcurrido y por la desaparici n de los que la llevaron a cabo
5369811 qu dec a sol n y c mo y de qui nes la hab a escuchado como algo verdadero
5369812 donde la corriente del nilo se divide en dos en el extremo inferior del delta hay una regi n llamada sa tica cuya ciudad m s importante sais de donde por cierto tambi n era el rey amasis tiene por patrona una diosa cuyo nombre en egipcio es neith y en griego seg n la versi n de aquellos atenea afirman que aprecian mucho a atenas y sostienen que en cierta forma est n emparentados con los de esta ciudad sol n contaba que cuando lleg all recibi de ellos muchos honores y que al consultar sobre las antig edades a los sacerdotes que m s conoc an el tema descubri que ni l mismo ni ning n otro griego sab a por decir as pr cticamente nada acerca de esos asuntos en una ocasi n para entablar conversaci n con ellos sobre esto se puso a contar los hechos m s antiguos de esta ciudad la historia de foroneo del que se dice que es el primer hombre y de n obe y narr c mo deucali n y pirras sobrevivieron despu s del diluvio e hizo la genealog a de sus descendientes y quiso calcular el tiempo transcurrido desde entonces recordando cu ntos a os hab a vivido cada uno en ese instante un sacerdote muy anciano exclam ay sol n sol n los griegos ser is siempre ni os no existe el griego viejo al escuchar esto sol n le pregunt por qu lo dices todos replic aqu l ten is almas de j venes sin creencias antiguas transmitidas por una larga tradici n y carec is de conocimientos encanecidos por el tiempo esto se debe a que tuvieron y tendr n lugar muchas destrucciones de hombres las m s grandes por fuego y agua pero tambi n otras menores provocadas por otras innumerables causas tomemos un ejemplo lo que se cuenta entre vosotros de que una vez faet n el hijo del sol mont en el carro de su padre y por no ser capaz de marchar por el sendero paterno quem lo que estaba sobre la tierra y muri alcanzado por un rayo la historia aunque relatada como una leyenda se refiere en realidad a una desviaci n de los cuerpos que en el cielo giran alrededor de la tierra y a la destrucci n a grandes intervalos de lo que cubre la superficie terrestre por un gran fuego entonces el n mero de habitantes de las monta as y de lugares altos y secos que muere es mayor que el de los que viven cerca de los r os y el mar el nilo salvador nuestro en otras ocasiones tambi n nos salva entonces de esa desgracia pero cuando los dioses purifican la tierra con aguas y la inundan se salvan los habitantes de las monta as pastores de bueyes y cabras y los que viven en vuestras ciudades son arrastrados al mar por los r os en esta regi n ni entonces ni nunca fluye el agua de arriba sobre los campos sino que por el contrario es natural que suba en su totalidad desde el interior de la tierra por ello se dice que lo que aqu se conserva es lo m s antiguo en realidad sin embargo en todas las regiones en las que no se da un invierno riguroso y un calor extremo la raza humana en mayor o menor n mero est siempre presente desde antiguo registramos y conservamos en nuestros templos todo aquello que llega a nuestros o dos acerca de lo que pasa entre vosotros aqu o en cualquier otro lugar si sucedi algo bello importante o con otra peculiaridad contrariamente siempre que vosotros o los dem s os acab is de proveer de escritura y de todo lo que necesita una ciudad despu s del per odo habitual de a os os vuelve a caer como una enfermedad un torrente celestial que deja s lo a los iletrados e incultos de modo que nac is de nuevo como ni os desde el principio sin saber nada ni de nuestra ciudad ni de lo que ha sucedido entre vosotros durante las pocas antiguas por ejemplo sol n las genealog as de los vuestros que acabas de exponer poco se diferencian de los cuentos de ni os porque primero record is un diluvio sobre la tierra mientras que antes de l hab an sucedido muchos y en segundo lugar no sab is ya que la raza mejor y m s bella de entre los hombres naci en vuestra regi n de la que t y toda la ciudad vuestra descend is ahora al quedar una vez un poco de simiente lo hab is olvidado porque los que sobrevivieron ignoraron la escritura durante muchas generaciones en efecto antes de la gran destrucci n por el agua la que es ahora la ciudad de los atenienses era la mejor en la guerra y la m s absolutamente obediente de las leyes cuentan que tuvieron lugar las haza as m s hermosas y que se dio la mejor organizaci n pol tica de todas cuantas hemos recibido noticia bajo el cielo sol n sol a decir que al escucharlo se sorprendi y tuvo muchas ganas de conocer m s de modo que pidi que le contara con exactitud todo lo que los sacerdotes conservaban de los antiguos atenienses el sacerdote replic sin ninguna reticencia oh sol n lo contar por ti y por vuestra ciudad pero sobre todo por la diosa a la que toc en suerte vuestra patria y tambi n la nuestra y las cri y educ primero aqu lla mil a os antes despu s de recibir simiente de gea y hefesto y m s tarde sta los escritos sagrados establecen la cantidad de ocho mil a os para el orden imperante entre nosotros ahora te har un resumen de las leyes de los ciudadanos de hace nueve mil a os y de la haza a m s heroica que realizaron m s tarde tomaremos con tranquilidad los escritos mismos y discurriremos en detalle y ordenadamente acerca de todo en cuanto a las leyes observa las nuestras pues descubrir s ahora aqu muchos ejemplos de las que exist an entonces entre vosotros en primer lugar el que la casta de los sacerdotes est separada de las otras despu s lo de los artesanos el que cada oficio trabaje individualmente sin mezclarse con el otro ni tampoco los pastores los cazadores ni los agricultores en particular supongo que habr s notado que aqu el estamento de los guerreros se encuentra separado de los restantes y que s lo tiene las ocupaciones guerreras que la ley le ordena adem s la manera en que se arman con escudos y espadas que fuimos los primeros en utilizar en asia tal como la diosa los dio a conocer por primera vez en aquellas regiones entre vosotros tambi n ves creo cu nto se preocup nuestra ley desde sus inicios por la sabidur a pues tras descubrirlo todo acerca del universo incluidas la adivinaci n y la medicina lo traslad de estos seres divinos al mbito humano para salud de ste y adquiri el resto de los conocimientos que est n relacionados con ellos en aquel tiempo pues la diosa os impuso a vosotros en primer lugar todo este orden y disposici n y fund vuestra ciudad despu s de elegir la regi n en que nacisteis porque vio que la buena mezcla de estaciones que se daba en ella podr a llegar a producir los hombres m s prudentes como es amiga de la guerra y de la sabidur a eligi primero el sitio que dar a los hombres m s adecuados a ella y lo pobl viv ais pues bajo estas leyes y lo que es m s importante a n las respetabais y superabais en virtud a todos los hombres como es l gico ya que erais hijos y alumnos de dioses admiramos muchas y grandes haza as de vuestra ciudad registradas aqu pero una de entre todas se destaca por importancia y excelencia en efecto nuestros escritos refieren c mo vuestra ciudad detuvo en una ocasi n la marcha insolente de un gran imperio que avanzaba del exterior desde el oc ano atl ntico sobre toda europa y asia en aquella poca se pod a atravesar aquel oc ano dado que hab a una isla delante de la desembocadura que vosotros as dec s llam is columnas de heracles esta isla era mayor que libia y asia juntas y de ella los de entonces pod an pasar a las otras islas y de las islas a toda la tierra firme que se encontraba frente a ellas y rodeaba el oc ano aut ntico puesto que lo que quedaba dentro de la desembocadura que mencionamos parec a una bah a con un ingreso estrecho en realidad era mar y la regi n que lo rodeaba totalmente podr a ser llamada con absoluta correcci n tierra firme en dicha isla atl ntida hab a surgido una confederaci n de reyes grande y maravillosa que gobernaba sobre ella y muchas otras islas as como partes de la tierra firme en este continente dominaban tambi n los pueblos de libia hasta egipto y europa hasta tirrenia toda esta potencia unida intent una vez esclavizar en un ataque a toda vuestra regi n la nuestra y el interior de la desembocadura entonces sol n el poder o de vuestra ciudad se hizo famoso entre todos los hombres por su excelencia y fuerza pues super a todos en valent a y en artes guerreras condujo en un momento de la lucha a los griegos luego se vio obligada a combatir sola cuando los otros se separaron corri los peligros m s extremos y domin a los que nos atacaban alcanz as una gran victoria e impidi que los que todav a no hab an sido esclavizados lo fueran y al resto cuantos habit bamos m s ac de los confines her clidas nos liber generosamente posteriormente tras un violento terremoto y un diluvio extraordinario en un d a y una noche terribles la clase guerrera vuestra se hundi toda a la vez bajo la tierra y la isla de atl ntida desapareci de la misma manera hundi ndose en el mar por ello a n ahora el oc ano es all intransitable e inescrutable porque lo impide la arcilla que produjo la isla asentada en ese lugar y que se encuentra a muy poca profundidad

5369901 canadian professional chuckwagon association competitors lost seven outriding horses and the pull horse of mine
5369902 thats eight head of horse that we had to put down this weekend on this track
5369903 we were too close so i couldnt get around him
5369904 it was lucky mitsuings wagon didnt veer left or it would have been a big mess
5369905 the other two gorst and waldenbach had infractions when they left the start
5369906 i guess its a win but its not how i wanted to win it
5369907 if it wasnt for the misfortune i would have had the pcs championship
5369908 this is the worst track weve ran on all season
5369909 the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5369910 they need to resurface the whole thing if they are going to keep running horses on it
5369911 ive been around it my whole life my grandpa did it my dad did it
5369912 since my dads been driving ive wanted to outride i knew that right away
5369913 the better the outrider you are the more heats youre gonna ride in
5369914 i was riding the heat jumping into the wagon box then id jump off the wagonbox onto the outriding horse and not even miss a heat
5369915 i really want to concentrate on making calgary stampede i got to start concentrating on driving
5369916 its a team thing its tough to get into this sport without a family
5369917 i was going to quit but instead of quitting i decided to go over there to the cpca for a year
5369918 i wanted to go to new venues meet new people and show the people my face instead of on tv its been great so far
5369919 in the wpca youve just got more top end competitors
5369920 the cpca still has lots of good drivers and lots of tough drivers but theres a few more of them in the wpca
5369921 yep every night i take these crabs down to the bay and let em swim around for a while then i whistle and they jump right back into this ice chest and i take em home
5369922 usually youre unlucky enough to have eight through a whole summer
5369923 and thats a very high number for a whole summer
5369924 the worst track weve run on all season the track is so beat up the surface is totally screwed
5369925 we dont like to see that here but it certainly is not related to the condition of the racetrack
5369926 we have professional equipment operators who have been doing this for years and theres no problems with our racetrack whatsoever
5369927 our guys know the conditions and they got the thumbs up from the cpca people when we had the track ready for them they checked it themselves and theres no issue with our track
5369928 when you have that many outriding horses dying that pretty much tells you the base of the track is shot
5369929 the horses run on a good surface all of a sudden they break through that base and they hurt themselves real bad that has to be what happened there
5369930 when the base gives way theres nothing more dangerous than that thats why it would be outriding horses theyre carrying the weight on their backs a wagon horse is just pulling they dont have weights on their backs so they wouldnt break through as much as an outriding horse
5369931 instead of a casual just review it were going to tell them before you guys get on this track were not going to get blamed for anything
5369932 well be taking this to our education committee to see whether we should have a position on it
5369933 at this point we recognize that its a legal sport and youd hope things would be as safe as possible for both the horses and drivers it sounds like the conditions of the track need to be looked at to ensure that its safe
5369934 these animals are really well taken care of and they love to run
5369935 there are equine events where theres higher risk and more injuries more issues but this is a highly promoted sport and it draws attention
