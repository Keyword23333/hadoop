5410224 its hard it feels like stone or marble or maybe metal i cant tell
5410225 dont make me laugh when im stuck down here on all fours with my face plastered against a mildewy rotten old shelf
5410226 its too far to the right i cant reach it completely and its heavy
5410227 maybe if we try to punch out some more of the shelf i can get to it
5410228 as im scrounging around in this spider infested hole struggling to unearth a possibly costly treasure for us
5410229 hold off on your treasure hunting for a minute oh great white huntress until i get this shelf cleared off
5410230 look at that strange writing on the metal strips around the box
5410231 i think its stuck she said an instant before the latch seemed to pop open on its own
5410232 oh rosie isnt this beautiful it looks like it was made of thousands of strands of glass ive never seen anything like it before
5410233 neither have i it looks like a perfume bottle whatevers inside is probably so old it smells like ass
5410234 im going to wait until i get it home to examine it more closely so i can safely set it on something other than a concrete floor crawling with age old crud
5410235 i dont think so his features look more mediterranean or something
5410236 the way he looks all solemn and stern while abigails expression suggests she was definitely quite pleased about something id say it looks like miss abby had herself a boy toy

5410243 the increasing trend toward contract research and contract manufacturing which has resulted in significant outsourcing of research and manufacturing in the pharma industry is seen as influencing growth in the laboratory analytical instruments market in india
5410244 being a highly competitive market with numerous suppliers in the fray this extreme price consciousness of buyers forces suppliers to keep a tab on the prices of their equipment
5410245 to remain competitive in the market foreign suppliers are forced to shed a portion of their margins to enable them maintain prices at acceptable levels

5410263 promoting collaboration and communication is one of the key objectives of the university in employing the new
5410264 as well as helping to ensure that graduates are already familiar with using industry standard communications this new service will enable innovative approaches to teaching and learning at the university
5410265 when a student graduates we do not see this as the end of their relationship with the university whether they wish to continue their professional development through further study keep in touch with the academic staff who have helped them throughout their academic career or simply correspond with fellow alumni the new studentmail system means that their e mail account remains available to them for the rest of their life
5410266 the university of aberdeen is the first educational institution in the world to utilise these technologies hosted in our dublin data centre it has been a pleasure to partner the university in developing a system that seamlessly integrates existing systems and registration processes within the university with those technologies hosted by microsoft in our data centre the university commitment to technological and service excellence has been clear to see
5410267 the it services and support available to students at aberdeen is fantastic the new studentmail and wireless systems are great examples of the importance attached to the student experience

5410270 gordon brown is right to say that wasting good food also wastes money
5410271 but he appears to point the finger of blame only at individuals rather than telling supermarkets that they need to sharpen up their practices there is huge waste throughout the food supply chain caused by buy one get one free promotions and cosmetic standards for fresh produce
5410272 supermarkets bombard shoppers with messages to buy more and eat more with highly persuasive price promotions
5410273 the promotions are carefully designed to prompt impulse purchases shoppers end up buying products that they did not plan to and a lot of that food goes to waste
5410274 we also know of farmers who have had to throw away up to a fifth of their crop just because supermarkets say the fruit or veg is the wrong colour size or shape 3
5410275 there is huge waste even before the food gets to the supermarket shelf gordon should use his influence with the supermarkets to prevent this
5410276 despite the progress made we are still a long way from having an environmentally sustainable food chain
5410277 if we are to get food prices down we must also do more to deal with unnecessary demand such as all of us doing more to cut food waste which is costing the average household in britain around 8 per week

5410293 we are all familiar with allotments and the odd community garden as features of the city landscape but more often than not a lot of space is wasted where with a little support we could see projects like this in the uk where salad crops vegetables and even fish are produced commercially within the city
5410294 we saw some really inspiring initiative in the states in chicago they were growing food amongst the ornamentals flower beds in the central park there were no fences and yet there was no vandalism with the harvested produce sold at a nearby market 5 it would be great to see some of these ideas adopted in london and cities across the uk

5410322 we recognise that there may be more we can do to challenge the demand for prostitution and we are looking at how to strengthen our approach
5410323 todays visit to the netherlands gives us an opportunity to look at the challenges they have faced the pros and cons associated with a regulated commercial sex industry and the work they are currently undertaking to reduce exploitation and harm including trafficking
5410324 we have already made considerable progress in terms of shining the light on those who pay for sex particularly in relation to on street prostitution we are now looking at how the problem is being tackled internationally to see what lessons we can all learn from each other
5410325 in the course of this review we have seen amongst our european and world neighbours very different solutions to the same problem we are starting to develop more fully our ideas as to what can work effectively for us
5410326 we need to tackle demand or we will be abandoning those whose vulnerabilities are used to trap them in to the sex industry to lives of misery
5410327 men who pay for sex fuel the evil trade of sex trafficking we support and protect victims as well as catch and prosecute traffickers but now we must step up our efforts to tackle the demand side
5410328 by visiting other countries such as sweden and the netherlands we can learn from how they are responding to this growing international problem and make sure that we are doing all we possibly can to stop this vile trade

5410333 i could talk about apr financing credit ratings and whether it was better to buy or lease a car

5410335 is there a limit to how much money i can deposit in my account
5410336 if i have an account and my friend wants to buy something can he take the money out of my account
5410337 if i put 50 in my account when im in the seventh grade and leave it there for three years will the money still be there when i want to get it out
5410338 dont joke with your friends you have to be serious not crazy
5410339 what if youre a responsible person but you also like to goof around can you still work at the credit union
5410340 its a really great way to learn about handling money
5410341 you have to expose yourself to these kids in a way you dont do in class
5410342 they still know that im going to be the one grading them in class
5410343 i had no previous record of spending money so i assumed theyd give me a chance
5410344 i guess the other kids just didnt know me that well
5410345 none i was a loner until i found the credit union
5410346 they have a lot of responsibility but in the end theyre still 17 years old
5410347 we run the credit union we choose the marketing campaign
5410348 why are we considered responsible enough to handle 2 million but not to decide who gets to be president
5410349 and large parts of our story are invented they have to be because no one knows the exact details all we could rely on what was george mcindoe told us
5410350 he told me the story but obviously i cant prove that its true
5410351 the film is an amusing series of misconceptions dragging in royalty
5410352 but certainly the caribbean connection to princess margaret is a fairly obvious one
5410353 thats the theory anyway but what is curious is that i have seen something that says that michael xs file is buried until 2054 which is extraordinary i mean what the hell he had that was keeping him out of jail and which was so important that they dont want it known about for another 50 years well it boggles the mind even if it was photographs of the royal family youd have thought that that wouldnt have had such a long after life
5410354 securing this prestigious title is a huge achievement for the university of aberdeen to be selected from amongst an extremely high calibre of institutions from throughout the uk and the us is a great honour and is deserved recognition of the contemporary forward thinking methods which the university deploy to ensure we are communicating effectively with our prospective students and applicants
5410355 from e zines and web portals to blogs and web chats the university has created a diverse set of communication tools in order to correspond with our new intake of students and those who are still considering their higher education options we recently introduced the chat initiative which allows prospective students to log on to a bespoke chatroom at specific times and speak to our team of experts about their future university career schemes such as this further demonstrate our commitment to enhancing our interaction with scholars by using the means of communication they would naturally use themselves

5410361 evolution did not change the building blocks only the size of the networks
5410362 while entirely of human design the internet now lives a life of its own it has all the characteristics of a complex evolving system making it more similar to a cell than a computer chip many diverse components developed separately contribute to the functioning of a system that is far more than the sum of its parts therefore internet researchers are increasingly morphing from designers into explorers they are like biologists or ecologists who are faced with an incredibly complex system that for all practical purposes exists independently of them
5410363 it is impossible to predict when the internet will become self aware but clearly it already lives a life of its own it grows and evolves at an unparalleled rate while following the same laws that nature uses to spin its own webs indeed it shows many similarities to real organisms
5410364 we will not engineer an artificial intelligence rather we will set up the right conditions under which an intelligence can emerge the greatest achievement of our technology may well be creation of tools that allow us to go beyond engineering that allow us to create more than we can understand
5410365 assuming that computer code can evolve much faster than biological reproduction rates
5410366 we will set up the right conditions under which an intelligence can emerge
5410367 the greatest achievement of our technology may well be creation of tools that allow us to go beyond engineering that allow us to create more than we can understand
5410368 a system cannot be analyzed into parts this leads to the radically new notion of unbroken wholeness of the entire universe you cannot take it apart for if you do what you end up with is not contained within the original whole it is created by the act of analysis
5410369 a human being is part of the whole he experiences himself his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness
5410370 we cannot expect to understand an intelligence by taking it apart and analyzing it as if it were a hierarchically designed machine

5410391 employ your time in improving yourself by other mens writings so that you shall gain easily what others have labored hard for
5410392 you have to look at what is best for your kids
5410393 charter schools give you a choice over being stuck sending them to the public school down the street
5410394 you see charter schools say to the world if you got a better idea show up and show us whether or not you can do a better job of challenging the status quo if the status quo is failing
5410395 charter schools affect a small percentage of the community at a large cost to the majority
5410396 so the community gets to decide what kind of school will most meet the neighborhoods needs
5410397 they allow schools to fit to kids instead of kids fitting to schools
5410398 mandatory school assignment proves to have detrimental consequences to students
5410399 most charter schools dont have to work with the local school system
5410400 there can be a personal connection between students and faculty
5410401 i know the names of all my students their parents even their pets
5410402 i have less resources and more costs i have to look at my students as 8 000 walking through the door
5410403 we found that unless state funding formulas change and charters can hire more experienced teachers then they cant effect the change they were created for
5410404 charter schools havent been around long enough and dont serve a large enough part of the population to know their long term effect
5410405 we still cant tell if traditional public schools will rise to the challenge or be further dragged down
5410406 when people who are opposed to the basic bill and opposed to the amendment lament the chance not to vote on an amendment which would undermine the bill people should understand where we are i filed the bill that included people who are transgendered earlier this year i was very proud when this house passed a hate crimes bill that included transgender the question we have is this if we do not have the votes to go forward with as much as we would like to do do we then abandon any effort and do we allow those who are opposed to any progress at all in the anti discrimination fight in this area to use a particular group as a way to prevent progress

5410446 we were surprised by the fact that nearly one in four children has eczema the number of people were seeing with eczema has increased over the past 10 to 20 years possibly caused by environmental factors although we know that our genetic make up is also important
5410447 children inherit one copy of the filaggrin gene from each of their parents if one of the genes they inherit is faulty then they will have a 25 risk of getting eczema if the child inherits genes from both parents that contain the fault then they will have a 90 risk of having eczema

5410494 the recent european food safety authority opinion clearly states that these four antimicrobials could indirectly spread the problem of resistance to antibiotics used in human medicine
5410495 using these chemicals is likely to take pressure off some producers to tackle the causes of bacterial contamination at source allowing decontamination with antimicrobials will probably hide problems on farm which have animal welfare implications
5410496 as well as these risks to human health and animal welfare consumers are not likely to welcome the idea of eating chicken disinfected with chemicals only a few years ago unscrupulous uk traders were convicted for selling out of date or condemned chicken that had been decontaminated with sodium hypochlorite the food standards agency should stand firm and protect the public not just to cave into pressure from the us to promote substandard chicken

5410499 this is an unprecedented result in the treatment of alzheimers disease we have demonstrated for the first time that it may possible to arrest the progression of this disease by targeting the tangles which are highly correlated with the disease
5410500 this is the most significant development in the treatment of the tangles since alois alzheimer discovered them in 1907
5410501 with the world population ageing globally and the enormous burden on health services and economies worldwide we urgently need to confirm our findings in a larger trial with a view to making this treatment available as soon as possible
5410502 world health organisation who figures indicate that there will be more than one billion people aged 65 and over by 2050 of whom we calculate about half will have tau tangles in their brains this makes it particularly important to develop new treatments to halt and prevent tangles forming in the brain
5410503 i am delighted with these results this is the first trial of an alzheimers disease modifying drug which actually hit its primary pre specified efficacy target
5410504 this is a fantastic breakthrough and is an example of an important collaboration between our spinout company taurx and the university of aberdeen there is no doubt that this close relationship has been crucial in providing an ideal platform for a major medical advance the university of aberdeen is extremely well placed to lead this research due to our first class imaging facilities in partnership with nhs grampian and our expertise in medicinal chemistry and medical sciences this is further evidence for aberdeens growing reputation as a centre of excellence in life sciences

5410526 while microfinance is increasingly well provided for although there is still huge unmet demand loans top out at around a few thousand dollars above that is a vast gap between a few thousand and 500 000 where financing options are almost nonexistent and it is precisely in this range mesofinance that successful small and medium sized businesses in developing countries seeking to expand need investment capital equipment financing or loans the gap is important because it is these businesses that provide most of the jobs and generate most of the new employment in every economy

5410558 but like other guerrilla conflicts from vietnam to iraq afghanistans war is an armed popularity contest to win soldiers especially commanders need skills that go well beyond good tactics and good aim they must also blend the street smarts of a beat cop with the sensitivity of a social worker the cultural awareness of an anthropologist and the deal making abilities of a big city mayor
5410559 our message to the afghan government is this we want a strong partnership based on more for more more resources from the united states and nato and more action from the afghan government to improve the lives of the afghan people we need a sense of urgency and determination

5410589 la prueba cuestionada fue admitida inicialmente como inspecci n ocular de los vagones si no fue practicada finalmente fue a causa de la imposibilidad material derivada de la destrucci n del objeto con anterioridad como recuerda el ministerio fiscal los trenes y su estado fueron objeto de pericial y la inspecci n ocular sobre los mismos fue objeto de grabaci n a pesar de ello puede resultar sorprendente una tan apresurada destrucci n que impidi un estudio posterior m s reposado y en profundidad e incluso su reiteraci n de haber sido necesaria de aspectos que pudieran haber resultado de inter s para la investigaci n pero lo cierto es que en el momento del juicio oral era materialmente imposible la pr ctica de la prueba lo que justifica que el tribunal acordara la continuaci n del juicio y prescindiera de ella

5410599 scientists have known about the possibility of using soil as a carbon sink for some time
5410600 but no one else has tried to design soils expressly for the purpose of removing and permanently locking up carbon once weve confirmed the feasibility of this method of carbon sequestration we can develop a computer model that predicts how much calcium carbonate will form in specific types of soil and how quickly that will help us engineer soils with optimum qualities from a carbon abatement perspective a key benefit is that combating climate change in this way promises to be cheap compared with other processes
5410601 these are preliminary findings from on going research once fully validated dr lyle armstrong will be submitting the work for peer review and publication as is normal procedure if the team can produce cells which will survive in culture it will open the door to a better understanding of disease processes without having to use precious human eggs cells grown using animal eggs cannot be used to treat patients on safety grounds but they will help bring nearer the day when new stem cell therapies are available
5410602 many of the deaths we see in the coral reefs which occur following coral bleaching events when huge areas of reef die off like in 1998 when 17 of the worlds reefs were killed can be put down to changes in the microbes which live in and around the reefs
5410603 these microbes can be thought of as being similar to the bacteria that normally live in our guts and help us digest our food
5410604 we need a better understanding of the processes and mechanisms that impact on corals and the reefs when sea temperatures rise to confirm the ultimate causes of their decline
5410605 although local actions to reverse the overall decline in reef health are probably not feasible we need this better understanding to try to reduce or eliminate contributing causes some of the changes in the microbes environment could be locally managed for example by reducing general pollution cutting soil erosion into the sea which chokes the reefs and avoiding harmful run off from farming practices
5410606 the reefs defensive mucus or slime is also at risk from stresses brought on by climate change this seems to happen just at a time when some of the key functional microbe groups are changing reducing the corals other defences and boosting some disease causing bacteria making them more virulent
5410607 if we want to protect and conserve these reefs for the future we need to start acting now and before we can do that we need a better understanding of the processes
5410608 the mass mortality of two of the dominant coral species in the caribbean due to disease has been unprecedented in the last 3 000 years which suggests a strong link to man made activities

5410647 anybody thats ever known me knows i aint never been no follower for him to say that was insulting

5410836 any macronutrient in excess can be stored as fat even dietary protein can be converted to glucose which is how when youre on low carb you get some glucose for your brain on an as needed basis however if you eat too much of it which is more than you need for amino acids gluconeogenesis and energy then yes itll convert to glucose and then travel that path to fat storage just like carbs
5410837 many small portions of a balanced diet would be primarily used for the above mentioned physiological processes few large portions of the same diet would do the same except that the excessive unused calories will end up in your fat cells in essence it is wise to spread out the caloric intake throughout the day to keep the body using the nutrients rather than storing them as fat
5410838 when people go on a calorie restricted diet the body feels that the nutrients are scarce and it assumes a starvation response it shifts its efficient state of energy production to a super efficient energy conservation state although people might experience weight loss in the first couple of days it is no more than water lost from broken down glycogen after a few days the dieter out of shape and energy resumes eating and mostly overeats with the bodys energy conservation ability at its maximum the dieter ends up regaining the lost pounds plus some more because of the reduced metabolic rate if the extra pounds are not lost within days the body shifts to a new set point the higher body weight and the metabolic rate is adjusted accordingly this is the basis of the yo yo dieting and this explains why people who diet often end up in the long run gaining weight rather than losing it
5410839 people who do not eat enough to maintain an optimal metabolic rate will end up gaining weight and efficiently keeping it more so than those who consume more calories that are widely spread throughout the day
5410840 people who do not eat enough to maintain an optimal metabolic rate will end up gaining weight and efficiently keeping it more so than those who consume more calories that are

5410843 a formula for hopelessness hopelessness may be more common in people who are required to change a major portion of the way they are living and less common in those that have already made or didn t need to make huge life transitions here s a formula i m playing with hopelessness uncertainty a belief in the need for overwhelming lifestyle shifts no social supports if you live on a thriving farm in an area with a huge group of active po community members with lots of practical skills you ll feel more can do than if you live in a suburban locale and know only other techies that are planning their in ground swimming pools and you yourself have never seen a cabbage grow

5410845 on behalf of all the members of 3 inches of blood we would like to express the utmost regret and sincere apology regarding the actions of our drummer alexei rodriguez that occurred in minehead in the early hours of november 10
5410846 in no way were alexeis actions a reflection of our band needless to say we were completely shocked and horrified to learn about these events and are grateful that saxon was still able to perform
5410847 alexeis behaviour was appalling and completely unacceptable and it is our decision to immediately remove him from the band

5410852 as a man i found this insulting to tell you the truth you dont get it daisy men marry slender women once were trapped they start getting fat and sloppy weve been cheated so why shouldnt we think about cheating on them with a sexy young woman with a good figure fair is fair if women dont want us feeling that way then they should keep on looking the same as when we married them women are made to cook and clean and be pretty and naked when theyre doing it
5410853 of course men dominate the media just the way they do everything else theres a logical reason for this daisy men are superior to women in most areas no matter how much women want to think otherwise honestly im not trying to be funny or smug or start an argument with you thats just the way it is its science its biology if men left things up to women wed be a nation of miserable horny men stuck with nothing but silly whiny fat cows to choose from men have to dominate the media to keep women in line and show them what we expect and deserve in an ideal woman
5410854 who approved this article youre a writer arent you then somebody should edit out all the stupid stuff you wrote about men before the blog was published you should be humiliated that now all your readers will know how dumb you are about men
5410855 how are you different today than the day he said i do to you chances are you are smarter knowledge grows with time and experience my question is do you still seduce him does knowledge seduce the man you are married to today or was it your flouncing flare for fashion take a look at how the girl in you dressed back then take a look at what the girls are wearing or barely wearing today has your gradual growth in knowledge caused you to gradually forget your original dares of fashion typically men recall the carefree frolicking girl who seduced them completely and made them fall head over heels into marriage and your husband is still in love with that girl only the girl has somehow disappeared over all these years and somebody smarter has replaced her
5410856 you talk about male dominated media males dominate it because women are too weak and emotional to deal with the stress of those jobs period personally i was offended by your obvious uneducated opinion of men i come here to your blog for a laugh and instead i waste my time reading a whole male bashing diatribe wise up daisy read your post again and youll see how foolish it sounds
5410857 you wanted to know about a mans feminine ideal from a physical standpoint so ill tell you open any magazine and look at the hot sexy skinny models thats what men want women like you would rather complain about how powerful and unfair men are instead of using all that energy complaining to just go on a diet have some self control for gods sake if you want to be thin then just do it and then come back and write a post about it you need to learn a lot about men
5410858 its a womans job to keep herself pretty and thin for her man she just has that one job to do nothing else is as important except for having sex when her man wants it you see daisy you dont understand men work hard to make a living and buy our women what they keep nagging for so its only fair that we get a real babe in return instead of the fat woman in the circus i personally like a french maid outfit on a cute naked babe one who is not a fat pig and you seriously think that is unfair for males to think that way
5410859 this made me laugh because the untrue things you had to say about men and how everything that happens in the world is always their fault and that women are always innocent is bullshit written by a comedian writer man hater feminist lol
5410860 just a bunch of crap and bullshit written by a bitter fat woman who doesnt know shit about real men
5410861 where did you get the idea the media is male dominated
5410862 youve made this day a special day by just your being you theres no person in the whole world like you and i like you just the way you are

5410866 the physical advantages of flexible circuits are projected to be the primary factors that increase demand in the years to come as fcp becomes the enabling technology to achieve desired size shape weight or functionality in an electronic device
5410867 with high density interconnection hdi becoming more mainstream it is anticipated that the growth of flexible circuits would also be hastened
5410868 japan is the largest contributor to the fpc board market but confines high technology pcbs in house while outsourcing only known technologies to low cost regions
5410869 the lack of experience of fpc manufacturing outside japan impedes the development of fpcs in other geographic regions
5410870 factors like the convergence between rigid and flexible pcs and the reduction in the organic growth across end user verticals are likely to hamper the growth of flexible pcbs in the later half of 2014 while at present the flexible pcb market has a lot of growth potential across verticals
5410871 in addition to this developments and innovations across various verticals accelerate the growth of this market immensely

5410960 a negative item may stay on your credit report for seven to ten years and sometimes even longer if the debt is sold over and over again and falsely reported
5410961 it is such a relief to know that i can rely on the services of i3 solutions and their incredible technology s o s score optimization system that provides consumers with solutions and the ability to fight back against the credit reporting agencies and all of the inaccuracies reported to their credit files

5411003 internet security threats are rising at an alarming pace and as consumers are becoming aware of the risks that encompass online collaboration there is a genuine concern that customers will constrain their online activity

5411007 only by working together and building on our shared values can we prevent terrorism in the first place we are investing at local level to build resilient communities which are equipped to confront violent extremism and support the most vulnerable individuals
5411008 the new guidance offers all those working in our local communities advice and support on how to turn the prevent strategy into practical measures and solutions that will make a real difference
5411009 the government is investing an additional 12 5m to support more projects in local communities prisons schools and youth justice system
5411010 preventing violent extremism is about supporting local people to build resilient communities where extremists and their messages of hate cannot take root
5411011 nationally and locally there is a growing alliance against violent extremism a majority of individuals
5411012 local leadership is vital and it is those people that know their communities best community leaders local authorities police and schools who with support from government provide the key to tackling this issue whilst no one pretends it is easy we are already seeing some fantastic work including projects working with some of the most vulnerable young people work to strengthen governance in mosques and the capacity of imams and muslim women beginning to take a stronger role
5411013 if we are to succeed in tackling the threat from violent extremism in the long term it is vital that we look to support the next generation of children and young people
5411014 extremists of every persuasion tend to paint the world as black and white accentuating division and difference and exploiting fears based on ignorance or prejudice education and positive activities for young people can be a powerful weapon against this
5411015 giving young people the opportunity to learn about different cultures and faiths and crucially to gain an understanding of the values we share will help to build mutual respect and tolerance from an early age and create an environment where extremism cannot flourish

5411045 but all the gangs have themes theres the baseball gang and a roller skating gang and the lesbian gang
5411046 err yes theres one gang thats had training in jazz and tap
5411047 what steve jurvetsons should blog be like and talk about
5411048 this is by far the weirdest video i have ever come across on the internet who ever made this is either a genius or a total retard im not sure which one
5411049 barack obama put his hand on my shoulder and i grab him around the waist wow he doesnt even sweat i think what a man
5411050 i see a lot of web sites missing the opportunity right there at the beginning because they failed to sell the benefit of subscribing to a particular newsletter
5411051 i see an awful lot of lonely nondescript boxes on homepages that say subscribe to our newsletter and thats it theres no earthly reason why a user would be motivated to do it unless they are already very vested in the topic of the web site and the execution of the web site
5411052 its basic but so much is basic the thing we tell people over and over at least in a brief promo line where the person can fill in their email address is to give a concrete specific benefit that would drive a visitor to sign up
5411053 the kinds of language and words that people need to use are the same things they need to do in all of their promotional copy all over the web site and links to basically be clear dont say anything vague empty or generic
5411054 put yourself in the users place and say why should i subscribe to this newsletter what solution is this newsletter offering and is there any sign that this newsletter is specific and focused and in line with my needs
5411055 i also think its important to link to a page off the home page
5411056 when i sign up for a newsletter the very next thing that happens is nothing
5411057 its a really good idea to send right away the latest version of whatever newsletter the user has subscribed to even if its two weeks or a month old and the next one is about to come out
5411058 back to the web site and invitation the other thing i see people do that i think is counterproductive is to overwhelm users with way too many choices
5411059 i see a lot of sites that will invite people to subscribe to a newsletter and offer a link and you end up on a page with 25 different newsletters
5411060 like all information on a web site anything that offers too much choice and overloads the user is not a good idea people should think about narrowing down the choices they offer in different newsletters
5411061 if they really need to have that many offerings they really should group them into categories that make sense organize the information
5411062 in addition to subject areas of interest a good basic kind of strategy is to carve users up into profiles based on demographics or how people use the site
5411063 its important when asking people to sign up for a newsletter to make it clear whether this is a newsletter primarily to notify the user about new material on the web site and not much more where the content is not in the newsletter
5411064 both are very valuable but not all users are interested in everything
5411065 i had to leave the home page and click to the page that i thought would tell me all the wonderful offerings and choices and allow me to subscribe to them instead i had to click another time to get to the sign up page if i could even figure that one out just having a box asking for an email address without telling the user what youre going to do with it is a great way not to get subscriptions for the newsletter

5411081 this afternoon we were able to show its potential for the first time
5411082 we sailed laps around the other five boats that joined us on the water and i think they will be scratching their heads tonight
5411083 you cant just forget about your poor kids or forget about your english language learners or your special ed kids or your black or hispanic kids or your boys youve got to do well by everybody nclb is better than anything weve ever had in the past on that score
5411084 think about a kid from a low income family nclb makes a lot of sense if it would work its saying to schools you cant ignore some of your kids just because theyre tough to teach
5411085 if youre going to have accountability for schools then you should also have accountability for students you dont want schools to be left hanging out to dry for students who dont try
5411086 when education is successful students teachers and administrators roll up their sleeves and work together
5411087 demanding 100 percent proficiency is the only way we could have gotten started
5411088 this is an experiment and were learning as we go
5411089 they should be teaching to the standards the tests are aligned to curriculum testing and standards are all being aligned which is the backbone of the accountability issue the finger wagging should be on the instruction our tests today are far better than they were a decade ago because of this legislation
5411090 minority and poor kids lose more achievement in the summer than do white and more affluent kids all the spread in the achievement gap happens when theyre not in school in the summer time
5411091 if we dont put more poor kids in gifted programs in k 6 how are we going to get them into ap classes in high school theyve had nine years of not being challenged so how can they survive the ability is there and the potential is there if given the opportunity
5411092 the lowest functioning kids can make progress even if they may never be proficient
5411093 across the nation one of the fastest spreading reforms is interim assessment
5411094 the upside to interim assessment is that teachers find out how well students are performing all along the downside is what do you do when you find out theyre not doing so well nobodys answering that question
5411095 one of the most fragile areas of nclb is the ability of states to manage the data
5411096 many statistical experts are going to work in the lower pressure higher paying testing industry so were leaving people in the states who dont have the technical skills to manage the information
5411097 would mean enormous efficiency and would undoubtedly result in tremendous improvements in quality if youre sinking all your resources into building one really great test you can do a great job
5411098 supplemental services havent worked as well as we hoped they would
5411099 if you move a child from an economically disadvantaged background and from a school that isnt rigorous into a school with a more rigorous curriculum that child is going to need a lot of support not just to catch up but to keep up
5411100 thats an equity issue you cant just put children in a new school to frustrate them and make them fail you have to believe in them and support them
5411101 if we could get every kid to have a good teacher every year and if the effects of having a good teacher had a shelf life and were cumulative it wouldnt take much of a change per year to add up to a standard deviation
5411102 weve got 12 years if students could move up a tenth of a standard deviation every year wed get up to 1 2 standard deviations
5411103 you havent hurt me and i need you your boys need you youre a great mom that woman is a bitch tell me who she is and ill beat the fuck out of her right now

5411123 it is our hope that democrats and republicans will stand together to support american energy freedom day on october 1 2008 on this day the current prohibitions on oil and gas exploration off the outer continental shelf ocs and in the oil shale fields of the west will expire giving americans the freedom to access their own energy and providing them with relief from sky high prices at the pump
5411124 we strongly encourage you to allow the expiration of these prohibitions on american energy exploration and production as scheduled under current law and we will actively oppose any attempt to extend them now is not the time to deny americans access to their own energy supply
5411125 on october 1st the bans on offshore drilling and oil shale recovery will end enabling us to finally be able to develop more american energy unless democrats actively prohibit exploration
5411126 utilizing these sources of american energy is needed to lower gas prices and to reduce our dependence on foreign oil i hope that speaker pelosi and democrats in the house and senate recognize the pain americans are feeling and will not actively enact legislation to block the development of american energy

5411135 nagulat ako nung malaman ko that lara will no longer be seen in wowowee coz lara is always saying that shes happy to be part of that show
5411136 nakakapanghinayang kasi sa tuwing napapanood ko siya lara sa tv feeling ko nasa pilipinas din ako kasama niya as a mother i was hurt sa mga lumalabas na write up lara should not be treated that way nakakalungkot kasi ito pala ang kapalit ng pagse celebrate namin ng mothers day
5411137 kasi unlike sa mga sinasabi sa maraming articles and mga rumors na kasama ko raw boyfriend ko lang the truth is i was with my mom as well this is my mothers gift to her to be in hawaii
5411138 i dont think so kasi everything is meant to happen naman talaga e
5411139 dont worry ma hindi yan ang kapalit so dont be sad about that kasi baka nagi guilty siya dahil sa pag give ko sa kanya ng trip to hawaii nangyari yung nangyari
5411140 i was pulled out siguro axed talaga is the term
5411141 ill tell you the story talaga nagalit si kuya kuya willie revillame
5411142 pero there was no rule to me i didnt understand that and i knew naman talaga that if i was going to bring my boyfriend and my mom dapat hindi maapektuhan ang work which is what happened
5411143 im sure that the people from wowowe who came with us they can attest to it na hindi ko naman napabayaan ang work ko i was never late i was never absent for any rehearsal for any tv guesting for the show itself i did my best i gave my best so surprise lang talaga ako doon sa reason nila sa pagtanggal sa akin because i brought my boyfriend and my mom along
5411144 the only time they saw my mom and my boyfriend was at the last day ng stay namin sa hawaii only in the airport na nga lang tapos nung nasa airport my mom didnt even watch the show para lang wala silang masabi kasi i was told okay if they are coming kung sasama sila huwag na lang silang magpakita dont let them come with you in the rehearsal or anything like that and that was they did
5411145 like for example lumaki ang aking ulo its just i planned not to cry but i think i will unintentionally
5411146 with binibining pilipinas binibigyan ko raw sila ng headache no i still have a good relationship with them i still go there a lot of times sa thats my doc daw bawal daw mag holding hands and everything if you watch the show i dont know youll see that we hug we do everything in the air
5411147 siguro in a way hes not telling me pero im sure he feels a little bit guilty kasi parang all of these e because of him pero hes just there to support me
5411148 i have a lot of dreams and i know that this is not the end of it wowowee even though you wont see me in that show anymore i know theres a lot more in store for me totoo talaga yung everything happens for a reason lahat ng bagay nangyayari because its meant to happen and i know that god put me in a place where i should be
5411149 i have to be honest talaga the show has given me exposure and i really enjoyed it and i really love the people i worked with there i missed them a lot pero i think you know the bridge has been burned talaga i was really hurt talaga
5411150 for that reason lang kasi tinanggal ako for that reason alone
5411151 even if they ask me to go back i dont think i can work na anymore
5411152 of course youll still see me at thats my doc

5411156 a topic perhaps of interest to others is how our soon to be kindergartners are reacting to the upcoming changes in their lives my sons preschool where he has been going for two and a half years ends tomorrow he knows hes starting a new school in the fall and he has visited it to add to the changes were moving this summer my son has always been extremely adaptable so i thought he would be fine with it all and he did appear to be until i finally put two and two together and realized all of the upcoming change is probably the reason why he started frequently wetting even occasionally pooping his pants about a month ago i have read many times that perfectly potty trained kids can regress when they face changes or stress in their lives and i felt so horrible when i finally realized a full month into it that this is probably whats happening since then i have taken time to talk with him more about the changes and how it feels and to assure him that it is all good no pee incidents today

5411187 we have to send out a message and reinforce it with immediate action it is completely unacceptable to carry a knife young people need to understand that carrying knives doesnt protect you it does the opposite it increases the danger for all of us destroys young lives and ruins families recent tragic events have reminded us of that i am pleased to see the police and the courts working with us to tackle this and make the streets safe in all our communities
5411188 those who carry a knife on our streets need to know that they will be caught and should expect to end up in court they will face tough consequences
5411189 it is crucial that we expose young people to the cold hard reality of the consequences of knife crime through the measures we are announcing today we are drumming home how carrying a knife can wreck lives
5411190 i totally support these initiatives which show how seriously we take knife crime
5411191 i have endorsed new guidance which brings into sharper focus for prosecutors the public interest factors supporting the prosecution of knife crime the message to offenders is plain if you are over 16 and in possession of a knife you can expect to be prosecuted i am confident todays initiative will make it absolutely clear that it is not acceptable to carry knives on the streets and that those who choose to do so will face serious consequences

5411226 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5411227 isnt that amazing its not as if weight watchers slim fast diet clinics jenny craig and the thousands of other companies making billions of dollars from promises of weight loss havent been trying if anyone could reliably make fat people thin theyd soon have more money than microsoft and haliburton combined
5411228 its worth noting that the negative effects of weight loss seem to exist regardless of if the weight is regained or not
5411229 the case for weight loss dieting typically assumes that fat people are fat because they eat more and exercise less than thin people that thin people if they ate as much as fat people would also be fat and that if fat people only normalized their eating habits they would be thin
5411230 why is it that people cannot seem to lose weight despite the social pressures the urging of their doctors and the investment of staggering amounts of time energy and money

5411296 no non sei snob lo sembri a volte ma rassegnati sei na carciofara dentro
5411297 in my old school i used to be on honor roll and it was easy
5411298 but now the work is more challenging but im still on the honor roll
5411299 they have more time with each student they go longer hours but theyre also making it fun
5411300 you dont get that in a normal public school theres just too many students and not enough time not enough patience and not enough consistency and communication that ive found here
5411301 we meet with the parents at the beginning of the school year and design a direction for the student to go in
5411302 in a classroom with 25 kids you cant individualize the lesson on 25 different levels
5411303 kids can do the work anywhere they have the materials with them
5411304 with this school they can do their work in their pajamas
5411305 with this many kids we never found one school that met all their needs
5411306 with this school we dont have to be adaptable theyre adaptable they have a basic curriculum but theres always flexibility
5411307 the thing i like the best is that you can do schoolwork whenever you want wherever you want just as long as you have a computer
5411308 i think the myth would be that parents are so dissatisfied with public schools that theyre turning to online education if that were true 98 percent of our students would not be taking one or two courses with us theyd be full time
5411309 whats happened in the last five years is that parents have come to appreciate the options out there and they want their kids to have the best education and the best opportunities
5411310 as children are growing up in an increasingly diverse world they need to have exposure to people different than themselves
5411311 im not saying it cant happen outside the public system but it happens easily in the public system in many cases
5411312 my concerns about home schooling and my concerns about charter schools are very much that the kids are not going to get the kinds of broad experiences with people who are different from them and ideas that are different from those they find at home
5411313 generally the studies ive seen cited are not finding dramatic differences particularly between charter schools and the regular public schools in terms of achievement
5411314 it might be that the kids like school better or the parents are happier with the school but in terms of achievement there havent been stark differences
5411315 i think that more and more people are getting that option is a good thing
5411316 but whether thats going to lead to the improvement of public schools or whether that means charter schools are going to offer a much better alternative remains to be seen

5411321 the website is down how many times did you restart
5411322 because were a choice school we have special in service
5411323 im not saying the trainings not helpful i believe in professional development but if there was money for the summer or after school or some other time that doesnt take away from time with the students that would be so much better my principal doesnt like it any more than the teachers do
5411324 we used to be at the periphery of cartersville but the city has grown around us
5411325 it was very affluent when i started here with a lot of high level kids and a small group of struggling kids we now have a large population of english language learners and cloverleaf qualified for title i funds for the first time three years ago our student population has gone from about 450 to more than 730
5411326 weve always done a lot of test prep type things
5411327 but our tests are changing to be more closely aligned with national standards that is theyre adding things theres never less so were seeing changes in all our curricula
5411328 one of the biggest things were required to do is a lot more teaching of writing
5411329 we were just talking about this at school we didnt feel that we had a lot of training in that area and we do think that needs to be addressed to prepare teachers they want us to incorporate writing more across the curriculum even in math and some of us feel a little intimidated by it
5411330 in math they want us to do much more with manipulatives
5411331 our reading program is three tiered and we struggle to get every component into the day we have to do shared reading guided reading and differentiated instruction its tricky timewise but i still make time for the things ive always done i still read aloud thats important
5411332 i think nclb does make you as a teacher think twice about the struggling students i think there are fewer kids falling between the cracks than ever before
5411333 but the ability to slow down and cover something really well just isnt there today for example i was teaching the concept of area about half got it and half didnt but i dont have another day because theres more to cover before tcaps come in april
5411334 i think that the love of learning and discovery can suffer in that kind of environment
5411335 we had about six weeks to prepare it was pretty stressful for everyone
5411336 now that the testing is over until next year i feel that what i do in my classroom is make sure that the children are good learners which i dont necessarily think is the same as being good test takers i go back to using a lot of group work technology in the classroom and differentiated instruction my school is supportive of that we get to loosen up a little bit and we get the test results back that year for use in the spring
5411337 my impression is that teachers are feeling more pressed than ever to be very strategic and limited
5411338 they dont feel free to do extended inquiry based units
5411339 but at peabody though we teach our students about the policy context and climate into which they are going we definitely do not teach them to teach to the test teaching needs to start with a look at students thinking and learning teachers need to figure out what their students make of what they are being taught to do that teachers need a more complex notion of assessment than just testing
5411340 however hes been the next logical person to go for a few weeks now the alliance has kept adam around in large part because he seems incompetent and dumb
5411341 his greatest strength it seems has been flirting with women on his original tribe
5411342 thats worked for him and kept him in the game this long
5411343 but if he keeps performing so poorly and appearing to be such a minimal threat he could be carried along until its too late for the others to get rid of him and that could be the best strategy of all
5411344 in the game you have only a few people to choose from to work with and we got along and he trusted me i dont know why he decided to trust me but he did and i knew that and i knew he wasnt going to turn his back on me and thats a great thing to have in a game

5411419 about two weeks ago the zambonis held our second band meeting in 15 years we decided to really prioritize our gigs only play those for big money or big exposure a few hours later were contacted by a band with an indie irish flair that sings great songs about pirates the moral of the story is band meetings are stupid
5411420 lots more work needs to be done but what these discoveries will do is help us start to classify the sub types of the illness so that individualised targeted medicine is possible in the future
5411421 at the moment a broad range of anti psychotic drugs are used to treat schizophrenia but because people respond to drugs in different ways treatments are largely trial and error and often involve unpleasant side effects
5411422 it is well recognized that schizophrenia has a variety of causes and several different factors can trigger episodes but mutations deletions and other variation in genes are probably the largest contributors
5411423 these are exciting new findings because the chromosomal abnormalities that have been described will be signposts to other genes involved in illness and hopefully lead on to new drug discoveries and novel treatment approaches this is good news for all the patients and their families throughout scotland who have given tremendous support to these genetic studies over several years
5411424 the field of schizophrenia genetics has been quite controversial for the last 20 years and some people would argue that no genes have really been found
5411425 but that era has now effectively drawn to a close because it is very difficult to dispute these new findings these discoveries consolidate the field and make psychiatric genetics after many false starts one of the most exciting areas in the biological sciences
5411426 much more work will need to be done before these discoveries impact on clinical practice diagnosis and treatment but the field is moving very rapidly moreover the uk and especially scotland is well placed to continue to play a leading role in continuing to reveal the complex genetics behind psychiatric disorders

5411476 to take part in the competition we had to design two cars we also had to put together a portfolio and present our ideas to the judges little cars lots of speed the cars are a bit longer than the length of your hand and about as tall as the height of your thumb the race takes place on a 20 metre track theres a c02 canister on the back of the car that propels it forward they go really fast about 40 50 miles an hour virtual wind tunnels when we were doing the designs we had to think about things like aerodynamics weight and friction once we had a design we tested it in a virtual wind tunnel its great because it shows you where all the pressure points are so you can redesign the car before you even build it a different piece of software actually carves the design out of balsa wood which is amazing once we had the 3d model we had to prime and sand the wood then we painted it white and added the logo we learnt how to use all the new software as we went along it takes a wee while but its easy enough to pick up declan second from the left and the rest of team hurricane three there were five people in our team and we each had a specific job to do i was the team manager i had to make sure everything was organised i didnt need to do too much though because everyone just sat down and did the job each person bought a variety of skills drawing sanding painting research and presentation it all gelled together and created a great team i really enjoyed the designing and id like to go into aeronautical engineering or maybe automotive engineering when im older the world championships it was great to be at the world championships it was brilliant meeting all the other teams everyone was really nice and it was good chatting to people about our design our car was the third fastest mini formula one car in the world we also won second for our verbal presentation and fifth overall were really pleased i think we did so well because the our cars aerodynamics were really great weve qualified for the world championships again next year theyll take place in rolando florida it would be amazing if we could go
5411477 today congress crossed a dangerous line between freedom and socialism
5411478 for the first time in our nations history the federal government will take ownership of private mortgages and give local and state governments billions to buy and flip homes we are forcing taxpayers to be liable for the worst and riskiest loans and allow executives at fannie mae and freddie mac to privatize their profits while socializing their losses
5411479 this bill wont solve the housing crisis but it will mortgage our children and grandchildrens future as we pile enormous debt on their backs and now everyone who buys a home will pay more because of the billion dollar mortgage tax in the bill that is being rushed through without debate
5411480 most concerning we are allowing a serious conflict of interest as fannie mae and freddie mac can still spend millions to influence lawmakers while they are being propped up by taxpayers fannie mae and freddie mac have built the biggest political machine in washington to protect themselves from reform and oversight but democrats are determined to keep the political donations flowing to their campaigns this is politics at its worst and sadly the culture of corruption in washington continues to grow
5411481 in the first three months of the year alone fannie mae and freddie mac spent a combined total of about 3 5 million on lobbying and hired 42 outside firms
5411482 in washington fannie and freddies sprawling lobbying machine hired family and friends of politicians in their efforts to quickly sideline any regulations that might slow their growth or invite greater oversight of their business practices indeed their rapid expansion was at least in part the result of such artful lobbying over the years
5411483 the rationale for this new fingerprint registry is thin were a significant number of bad loans made by ex convicts and how would the targeting of lower level employees rather than executives like countrywide financial ceo angelo mozilo stem the creation of problematic mortgages
5411484 recovery schools are not treatment centers but they support treatment gains
5411485 these schools benefit recovering students by enabling them to test increasing levels of responsibility and leadership gradually
5411486 but on the advice of people at nida we realized that was premature theres a lack of an evidence base so instead were trying to answer a more basic question what is a recovery school were seeing some pretty wide differences
5411487 rather than a few typical models what were discovering are a number of aspects around which we can begin to build a picture of what recovery schools look like
5411488 in 1982 i stepped off a greyhound bus at the corner of vine street and de longpre avenue in downtown hollywood i had 1 200 sewn into my underpants i had a tiny suitcase and i had dreams i had dreams as big as the california sky

5411501 i entered the modeling business as an entrepreneur and businesswoman
5411502 that man taught me a lot about business i didnt quit and that was the foundation of how i learned to under promise and over deliver
5411503 i had closed the door on modeling but then this small business asked me to model their socks i didnt want to do that but i thought it could be a good place to start my business
5411504 far from over and we are confident that we have a winning strategy

5411510 the federal government competes with top private sector employers for talent and its important that it have the tools to compete effectively
5411511 i am pleased congress has acknowledged the important role federal employees play in protecting the homeland supporting our troops abroad fighting crime battling disease and otherwise providing services to the american people
5411512 it is important to our democracy that government continues to improve quality of life for citizens
5411513 improving parks and transportation helping law enforcement agencies meet their needs and assisting seniors are worthy projects and i thank my colleagues for including these measures in the final legislation
5411514 these are key elements of local learning and research and deserve federal funding

5411516 there are places to purchase food where you can buy chips beer cigarettes and soda
5411517 if there are fruits and vegetables at those stores theyre often poor quality and theyre very expensive
5411518 i heard over and over that people liked fruits and vegetables but they werent able to purchase them because it wasnt convenient it wasnt accessible to them and in their busy lives that barrier was a big barrier
5411519 this is something that we felt was important to be able to get good food into areas that dont have that available
5411520 we could sell this produce other places but we felt this was such an important endeavor that we couldnt take money for it
5411521 we have to give people an opportunity to make the choice to be healthy
5411522 you may come up and see that theres peaches and peach ice cream you may pick the peach ice cream every time but at least you had the opportunity to choose the healthier option
5411523 working with the produce stand has allowed me to become involved in community activities and become aware of other resources within this community
5411524 each saturday the stand has nearly sold out of all the produce and has provided part time employment for two youth who also live in the community
5411525 now we got a new attitude were going to train people for jobs that actually exist and therefore requires a system that is flexible
5411526 a system willing to take input from the employers a system which is willing to change curriculum if need be to meet the needs of the local workplace

5411594 theres incredible interest in growing your own food vegetable seed is overtaking flower seed sales for the first time we hope this work will be the catalyst for a new dawn for urban agriculture
5411595 this paper provides inspiration and useful guidance for residents and social landlords looking to set up similar projects
5411596 the food growing project on the spitalfields estate is an inspiration residents are talking to their neighbours taking charge of their own space and having a pride in it as well as cheap healthy food there are physical and mental health benefits from the outdoor activity involved
5411597 the public sector spends 1 8 billion on food that money could be used to prioritise healthy food and to support environmentally sound food businesses farmers and thriving local economies the time has come for the public sector to recognise that it is a major investor of the publics money and use that money for public good
5411598 sustain works with public sector organisations such as schools and hospitals to help them improve the healthiness and sustainability of their food they show that it is possible positive and practical yet at the moment we are relying on individual enthusiastic caterers to do the right thing they are great champions but top level government support is now needed to ensure that the very considerable public health benefits are enjoyed by people and communities throughout the country the uk government must follow the lead of the dutch government and several regions in italy which have already done so

5411614 trying to do the right thing for our planet is fraught with difficulties when it comes to fish with everyone jumping on the band wagon of local or sustainable the msc provides a restaurateur complete reassurance they are doing the best they can for our oceans as you might expect peace of mind doesnt come for nothing and the chain of custody presented our chefs with more paperwork than they would normally be asked to do but with the goal of better managed oceans at stake its a small price to pay
5411615 choosing sustainable fish is a minefield msc certification provides you with the assurances you need with our group we hope to have created a straightforward cost effective model that other restaurants can follow wouldnt it be fantastic to be able to order sustainable fish on menus everywhere in london
5411616 were really pleased to have been able to work with the msc on this exciting project restaurants can have a huge influence on diners eating habits and these four businesses are setting a fantastic example by serving and promoting certified sustainable fish

5411638 but im frustrated we must fight the battle again to ensure federal civilian employees receive the same pay raises as members of the military its easy to blame bureaucrats for the nations ills but the fact is our government could not operate without these hard working individuals most of whom could make more money if they hadnt chosen to dedicate their professional lives to serving their fellow citizens

5411647 people involved in antenatal care should listen to womens hopes for labour whilst also preparing them for what might actually happen during labour
5411648 plans for a labour free of pain relief need to be complemented by preparing women for the possibility that they might need pain relief education can help to fill the gap between expectation and experience and thus ensure women are realistically prepared for their birthing experience
5411649 our analysis highlights the importance of antenatal education it can empower women to have realistic expectations and make informed decisions
5411650 if women can be better educated they can express their preferences but also be aware that things may not always go to plan they can then be prepared for different eventualities and so make more realistic decisions and have a better experience

5411652 when newcomers come here they enter into a deal with the uk to work hard play by the rules and earn their right to stay
5411653 to ensure that deal is delivered we have already increased resources by putting 1 000 additional immigration staff on enforcement duties and are on track to double our enforcement resources by 2009 10 and deliver immigration crime partnerships in every part of the uk
5411654 central to this plan will also be the creation of local immigration teams bringing our staff closer to the communities we serve
5411655 the uks immigration system is undergoing the biggest shake up for a generation and these changes will ensure our frontline officers can continue to implement these reforms and meet the tough targets we have set the uk border agency
5411656 the police will continue to work closely with the uk border agency to achieve our ambition in combating organised immigration crime and to create a hostile environment or those who commit these offences
5411657 we are delighted at the prospect of welcoming ukba into cifas membership with fraud growing rapidly in both the public and the private sectors and the pressure this creates for the resourcing of public services ukbas decision represents a positive step forward in the fight to stop illegal entrants to the uk diverting resources from those with the legal right to be here and legitimate needs

5411702 it would surprise many americans to learn that the worlds greatest deliberative body passes the overwhelming majority of legislation without any debate at all democrats think they are entitled to pass bills without debate or votes and theyve tried to ram them through right before recess to pressure us to give up but senators shouldnt fear debate on these important bills its in the best traditions of our republic to demand the senate actually do its job and have a public debate on bills that expand government and increase the burden on taxpayers senator reid can complain all he wants but republicans represent millions of americans whose voices are being silenced by democrat strong arm tactics
5411703 the u s senate has a nine percent approval rating because the american people believe that much of our work is done in secret with no debate no transparency and no accountability this report shows that the reality is worse than the publics fears instead of encouraging open debate im disappointed that majority leader reid often chooses secrecy or demagoguery for instance he has depicted my effort to reduce the number of bills that pass the senate in secret by ten percent as unprecedented obstruction what is unprecedented and ahistorical however is the majority leaders view that senators should have a king like right to pass massive spending bills in secret with no debate no amendments and no recorded vote

5411718 im not interested in this particular area of discussion and its not why i seeded the article
5411719 what it comes down to is that there simply are some responses that are good engaging sincere and well thought out and frequently these are the responses ignored by authors who are uncomfortable with the idea of productive debate

5411746 we have increased illegal working operations by 40 per cent and last year we deported 80 per cent more foreign criminals
5411747 although stronger border security demands these controls i know local communities will have concerns my commitment is to listen to these personally
5411748 we are currently undertaking the biggest shake up of our immigration system for 40 years alongside the expansion of our detention estate we are making it harder than ever for people to cross into the uk illegally
5411749 we are appalled by the eus blatant refusal to hold israel to account for its persistent violations of human rights and international law the eu is well aware of israels ongoing illegal occupation of gaza and the west bank including east jerusalem and the massive colonization of the latter after all the eu member states have regularly voted for un resolutions condemning israels human rights violations collective punishment and construction of settlements and the wall
5411750 we oppose the upgrade of relations between eu and israel and call for the suspension of the eu israel association agreement
5411751 our common goal to upgrade relations stems from our awareness of the traditional links the cultural and human values and the economic and security interests that we share such a partnership will imply a stronger involvement of the european union in the peace process and in the monitoring of the situation on the ground
5411752 relations between the parties as well as all the provisions of the agreement itself shall be based on a respect for human rights and democratic principles which guides their internal policy and constitutes an essential element of this agreement
5411753 the eu should pursue this approach e g dialogue on human rights wherever possible while recognising that in some cases the third country may have no genuine commitment to pursue change through dialogue and consultation and negative measures may therefore be more appropriate

5411846 for many american leaders energy security means producing energy at home and relying less on foreigners but the united states imports three fifths of its oil and the share is heading up for the foreseeable future alternative fuel is unlikely to change that
5411847 energy interdependence can actually be good for energy security just look at natural gas markets right now nearly all the natural gas that americans consume comes from u s and canadian fields only 3 percent comes into the country by tanker in the form of liquefied natural gas this renders the united states highly vulnerable to disruptions on its home continent if terrorists or a hurricane took out a key pipeline it would be hard to bring in alternative supplies from outside north america and prices would spike upward by buying more liquefied natural gas from a diverse range of foreigners the united states would reduce its energy independence but enhance its energy security

5411894 that unicef would refuse further support from leviev was never really in doubt because of his violations of international humanitarian law it is absurd that leviev was able to burnish his image through his support to unicef
5411895 this is in the beginning stages now since we need to confirm the media reports a final decision could be taken as late as november its not a simple process
5411896 the long established international brand leviev owned and controlled by klg jewellery llc would be offered to customers in the emirate of dubai uae exclusively through the outlets solely owned controlled and managed by levant llc

5411900 their top students overlap with top schools and those students will typically go to harvard over union at the bottom the students they get overlap with less selective schools that are heavily into merit aid
5411901 you end up left with the broad middle which for union is too homogeneous white suburban upper middle class kids
5411902 was can we buy students and how much would it cost
5411903 i think williams is not one step above union but two at this level kids arent just swayed by price but by perceptions of prestige
5411904 it came down to asking themselves is five points more on the average sat score of your students worth a million dollars
5411905 you have a family that makes 60 000 a year and they would not aspire to something like their son or daughter having a summer in europe during high school you have a family that makes 150 000 and they do aspire to that
5411906 when assessing need for aid do you take into account that a family with 150 000 a year expects to take a vacation in the summer drive a lexus not a taurus and send a child to europe whats a necessity and whats a luxury you cant help but judge people when you try to decide that
5411907 are they asking for more money because theyre shopping us to leverage a better deal at another school
5411908 when it comes to money the attitude seems to be just ask ask ask
5411909 you wont get the best price until theyre convinced you want to buy
5411910 he said if we offered them 20 000 in aid theyd come to union anything below 18 000 probably not i know how it sounds but the dad is actually nice
5411911 what if we increase his award by 3 000 and give him 17 000
5411912 were not going to use the money we save to buy a car or something
5411913 were counting on this premed program to have cachet we dont need to give merit money
5411914 its harder to ride on cachet alone when shes getting 5 000 and 10 000 scholarships at our competitors
5411915 i can borrow against my home but i dont want to
5411916 what if my husband loses his job i have a younger child and theres graduate school to pay for
5411917 to take away my daughters dream like that i feel like crying
5411918 we are most comfortable with total expenses to us in the range of 15 000 per year or thereabouts
5411919 but hes not they can afford to pay its just a matter of priorities
5411920 my definition of middle class is someone who has to think about what hes buying
5411921 do you really want to turn down 7 500 a year to go to union
5411922 there are still families that are willing to sacrifice for their childrens education
5411923 the phrase eat macaroni and cheese has from time to time crossed my lips
5411924 ive seen us haggling over a few thousand dollars in the academic budget over things we desperately need
5411925 then to turn around and throw this money at people who dont need it its a little disturbing
5411926 in the end well all be in the same situation we started from
5411927 well pay huge sums of money to get the same students we would in any case but with less net revenue to spend on everyone after they get here
5411928 pushed union from fourth choice to one of his top ones we felt that he would have gotten an equally good education at any of these schools at union it cost 80 000 less
5411929 we could have only afforded to pay for a year and a half of johns education
5411930 but i think we could have offered half tuition and been as successful
5411931 the ones who are coming to union had very very nice choices but were not seeing brown or dartmouth in there
5411932 whatever we do we have to somehow find a way to translate it into a dollar amount for the parents
5411933 is it worth it worth is such a loaded word
5411934 how do you place a dollar figure on something you cant put your hands on

5411984 as adults we have an urgent obligation to ensure that poverty does not determine our childrens future

5411986 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
5411987 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
5411988 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families
5411989 we owe a debt of gratitude to congressman farr for his continuing support of these critical programs
5411990 silver star is exactly the kind of local project that federal dollars should support
5411991 i visited their facilities in january and spoke with the kids who are being helped by the programs and it was a very touching time i will continue to support silver star its one of the few bright lights in our battle against gang violence
5411992 keeping the central coasts military presence on the cutting edge has been a top priority of mine
5411993 from fort hunter liggett in the south to dli and nps in the north our active duty presence is vital to military readiness and im pleased to have funds included in this bill for important programs
5411994 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
5411995 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations

5412058 two million miles of fedex service is a significant milestone for hybrid vehicles
5412059 fedex continues to work to advance clean truck technology we now need the collective leadership of business nonprofits and government to make cleaner delivery vehicle technology widely available its time for the truck manufacturing industry to create its version of the prius clean affordable and widely available for truck fleets
5412060 fedex has been very happy with the operational and environmental performance of the fedex hybrids we continue to look for opportunities to introduce more fuel efficient vehicle models including hybrids into our fleet
5412061 fedex leadership has helped to make hybrid truck technology a reality
5412062 there is tremendous momentum in the hybrid truck market today with more trucks on the road and more companies buying hybrids every day the fedex and edf collaboration jump started this market transformation we demonstrated that the trucks work in the real world and that they can slash both greenhouse gas emissions and fuel costs

5412071 carbon has the ability to bond to a wide variety of elements as well as to itself in various different configurations this is driven by the remarkable ability to hybridize orbitals so one has sp3 sp2 and sp hybrids each driving a different geometry this ability to shift shape gives carbon the ability to readily create stable compounds with complex three dimensional structures see above creating keys to any desired lock if you will i cant think of any other element that has the flexibility to make rings of three members right up to six plus with relative ease for example
5412072 a likely requirement for any kind of chemical based life is large molecules with structural diversity lifes bound to be complex and carbon compounds give you all the complexity you can handle straight and branched chains rings whatever you want and those bonds come in more than one flavor carbon gives you a wonderful 1d 2d 3d building set theres another key thing about the element more structural and reactive diversity comes from all the ways that carbon can form bonds with other elements weve got solids liquids and gases acids and bases of all strengths nonpolar compounds and polar ones fitted with all kinds of electron rich and electron poor zones and reactivity all the way from rock solid to burst into flames
5412073 any physical experiment can be regarded as a computation and any computation as a physical experiment
5412074 certainly wont ship as a product in your lifetime or mine
5412075 every student of organic chemistry has heard the story of how the structure of benzene appeared to kekul in a dream in which he saw chains of carbon atoms dancing in circles like a snake chasing its own tail
5412076 computation with anything that seems biological is more than just speculative even if the prose is appealing to computationally centric futurists

5412079 its really difficult to know what kind of fees are being charged by investment banks on swaps
5412080 its really helpful to have a third party the investment bank doing a swap doesnt represent the issuer
5412081 bankers will come in and tell you what you want to do but they wont show you how to do it cheaper

5412170 the financial sector is not going along with the effort
5412171 arbitrary aversion to lend even with industries that continue to grow
5412172 im stunned this is what a bank is supposed to do theres sand in the gears
5412173 when lending officers become afraid they call in loans and slow or stop their lending no matter how good their clients credit may be in actuality instead of seeing opportunity they see only danger ironically much of the actual danger appears as a consequence of the reckless impulsive decisions that they made in the preceding uptrend
5412174 banks seem to be blind to the danger of overpriced collateral as they continue to stuff their balance sheets with mortgage backed assets lenders are still behind the curve but once they see the writing on the wall the rug will get pulled out from under the economy in a hurry

5412178 but some lebanese and other arabs around the region including the saudis while obviously not in favor of the israeli assault are seeing this crisis as a death knell for hezbollah and quietly cheering it on
5412179 it is our impression that aside from seeking to return the abducted soldiers israel is pursuing wider goals
5412180 a distinction must be made between legitimate resistance and uncalculated adventures undertaken by elements inside lebanon and those behind them without recourse to the legal authorities and consulting and coordinating with arab nations
5412181 these elements should bear the responsibility for their irresponsible actions and they alone should end the crisis they have created

5412204 im telling you after five minutes ive ceased to think im looking at a screen its not like reading a computer screen its more like reading a piece of paper i think its actually clearer easier on the eye than the printed word
5412205 its like paper and its very interesting its very very crisp very functional very readable

5412223 it would be great a huge achievement to win it
5412224 it would certainly give us a lot of confidence there are some really good young men in this group not just good rugby players that bodes well for the future as well
5412225 this is a new team with a lot of new players very early in its infancy but this is the best win we have had
5412226 we have been under a lot of pressure as a group and we have responded magnificently to that pressure
5412227 i think we have had one or two top games one against australia and now this one when a lot of people were writing us off
5412228 i hope so some of them deserve to have sore heads they have three weeks off now and the professional game means that you dont get too many opportunities to enjoy and celebrate your victories we are lucky this time we can the guys had a couple of drinks and thats the way it should be
5412229 results like this hasten the development process when you have to go to the depths we had to go to in this match from a physical and mental point of view and to come out on the positive side that certainly hastens the development of your players they know they can go to the well and keep going to it that is important
5412230 i have no doubt they will be in the right space and up for those games
5412231 australia are under their own pressure they havent won away from home for 15 games and thats a monkey they have to get off their own back
5412232 its not going to replace traditional bank lending anytime soon but it will be an alternative for some
5412233 it certainly wont relieve the entire credit crunch in the private sector because its a huge difference in magnitude but it is a growing niche
5412234 traditionally you could not get small business financing from banks until you had two to five years of financials to present to them
5412235 creates an opportunity for new business owners or someone with a business idea to pursue that entrepreneurial dream and get it financed by people who find it intriguing or the persons credit history to be good enough that people will take a risk on them
5412236 how many people would lend to a stranger that told them im way over my head in debt but in virtual worlds like these lots of people are saying i feel like this person needs help and i feel good about this person people arent making normal credit analyses theres emotion involved

5412252 nearly 1 in 4 california students will drop out during high school state educators said wednesday basing their prediction on what they said is the most accurate information about student attendance theyve ever collected
5412253 bay area dropout rates vary widely by school district but three have rates far higher than the 24 percent state average oakland unified 37 percent west contra costa unified 40 percent and vallejo city unified 42 percent
5412254 in san francisco 1 052 high school students quit last year based on that researchers believe that 21 percent of entering freshmen will quit before earning a diploma
5412255 californias dropouts cost the state 50 billion per year said incoming state senate leader darrell steinberg a sacramento democrat who quoted studies showing that over their lifetimes those who quit are more likely to be unemployed turn to crime need state funded medical care get welfare and pay no taxes
5412256 it came to light that mrs reiser secretly obtained russian citizenship for her children and they were taken to russia by their maternal grandmother after the son testified that he saw his mother get into her car and leave the reiser house on the day of her disappearance and that he and his father played video games all afternoon contradicting prosecuters allegations that mrs reiser was killed in the house and that mr reiser later disposed of the body

5412259 if were determined to cure our addiction to oil then we will need nuclear facilities to power our plug in hybrid electric cars or to make the hydrogen for our fuel cells this is not a green pipe dream in fact given the way automotive technology is developing it is plausible that a majority of vehicles sold in the u s by 2020 will use electric power trains increasing our need for electricity
5412260 when i helped found greenpeace in the 1970s my colleagues and i were firmly opposed to nuclear energy but times have changed i now realize nuclear energy is the only nongreenhouse gas emitting power source that can effectively replace fossil fuels and satisfy growing demand for energy

5412482 oh i wish that i was a real blogger so i could go
5412483 the gay community has infiltrated the very centers of power in every area across this country and they wield extreme power that agenda is the greatest threat to our freedom that we face today why do you think we see the rationalization for abortion and multiple sexual partners thats a gay agenda
5412484 i favor the death penalty for abortionists and other people who take life
5412485 we need someone who will speak morally on the issues and not run from the criticism of the national press we need to have moral clarity about our leaders i have a 100 percent pro life record i dont apologize for saying we need to protect the unborn do you realize that if all those children had not been aborted we wouldnt have any trouble with medicare and social security today thats another 41 million people
5412486 if i wanted to buy a bazooka to use in a very restricted way to do something i ought to be able to do that
5412487 i dont want 4 doors two is more than enough
5412488 a government controlled chemical substitution program or approaches such as requiring the thousands of facilities across the country that use or store chemicals to prove to the government that safer materials dont exist could become exercises in excessive bureaucracy and paperwork
5412489 sound science not ideology or profits will guide federal environmental policy
5412490 right now safe climate friendly nuclear energy is a critical way both to improve the quality of our air and to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources
5412491 i support yucca mountain once it goes through all the processes it needs to go through
5412492 but i also support reprocessing a little straight talk we have to do both
5412493 despite the fact that our government has spent billions of dollars on yucca mountain it is not clear that nuclear waste can be safely stored there i believe we should redirect spending to alternatives such as improving the safety and security of spent fuel at plant sites around the country at the same time we should continue looking for a safe long term disposal solution based on objective scientific analysis
5412494 its time for the big chemical companies to do their part to help protect america they should stop manufacturing dangerous chemicals when safer substitutes are available and if they wont do it congress should do it for them in the chemical facility anti terrorism act of 2008
5412495 i was actually scared that i was never going to see him again
5412496 i literally said i will probably never see him again
5412497 she got over it but she was always wishful that hed come back
5412498 she kept his toy she had a scrapbook with his picture
5412499 at first of course we thought its the wrong dog
5412500 she actually wanted to go to georgia to pick him up but the ride back was too long
5412501 it was a very nice moment just to see him he was doing well he looked well kept
5412502 my understanding is that natalie ran off into the bathroom and started crying right away she is a real animal lover
5412503 somebody must have taken him there i honestly dont think he walked there
5412504 the truly national elements of real id should be funded from washington
5412505 i hope dhs will use these grant funds to reward initiative by states such as virginia which havent looked for excuses to delay
5412506 throwing money at states that have done nothing would send the wrong message
5412507 dhs seems willing to acknowledge how far some states have come and how far others still have to go toward meeting one of the 9 11 commissions central recommendations
5412508 this is a good start but its just a down payment on effective and timely implementation of real id
5412509 we are honored to continue working closely with nis america and provide wide distribution in north america for these three great rpgs
5412510 over the years we have built a strong relationship with atlus
5412511 we have worked together on a number of great titles in the past and we are thrilled to partner once again to release averna said
5412512 humpty dumpty sat on a wall humpty dumpty had a great fall
5412513 what has passed the congress in record time is a gift to the middle class and those who aspire to it in our country
5412514 notre but en travaillant avec les annonceurs et les agences est de les aider d velopper leurs marques toucher les consommateurs et trouver de nouvelles fa ons daugmenter leurs ventes d clare sue decker pr sident de yahoo
5412515 people will always know the real title of this album and what to call it
5412516 remember when you asked me what id do if i was filthy rich
5412517 you finally thought of something besides buying all those video games and getting your own beer cellar
5412518 why are those the only things you remember when i came up with all sorts of cool interesting stuff
5412519 i guess its because a wealth of video games and beer are the things that most epitomize you my darling
5412520 well now i have an actual shopping list i can follow
5412521 oh you mean from all the fabulous comments people left on my last blog
5412522 they had some great ideas about how theyd spend their money if they were insanely wealthy didnt they ive added a lot of their items to my own list
5412523 oh thats right youre too busy lopping off heads and arms and slaying evil blood spurting aliens in your video games
5412524 indulging in gratuitous video game carnage is how i relax after a hard day
5412525 now do you want to hear what i have to say or not
5412526 you might want to use this for a future blog
5412527 im sorry sweetheart i was just kidding of course i want to hear what you have to say
5412528 itll teach you how were supposed to live after you make your first billion selling porn
5412529 michael that is not funny how many times do i have to tell you that i do not write porn
5412530 if you could see your face each time i say it youd know how funny it is anyway
5412531 the stuff in this magazine makes the price of those expensive herman boris yeltsin bags
5412532 theyre hermes birkin bags if were going to be billionaires then you really need to up your savoir faire quotient
5412533 whatever it makes those purses look like discount store stuff its all summarized here
5412534 it compares moscow new york and london says that one in six billionaires call those cities home
5412535 first thing im going to get is the 800 haircut in new york
5412536 what in the hell could possibly warrant eight hundred bucks for a lousy haircut
5412537 oh maybe a harem of naked girls tending to the customers every need during that lousy haircut
5412538 stop right there ive been cutting your hair for years and i see no reason why i should stop when we get rich
5412539 maybe if you put on a harem outfit then peeled it off
5412540 i vote for an in depth discussion on the plot of your latest book
5412541 charles my darling filthy rich billionaire have i told you about the m nage in my latest story
5412542 youve made this day a special day by just your being you theres no person in the whole world like you and i like you just the way you are
5412543 all god does is watch us and kill us when we get boring we must never ever be boring

5412612 my mom called me freaking out saying papi youre everywhere youre in people magazine us weekly perez hilton and tmz and im thinking to myself there must not be enough drama going on in this world to have me in the tabloids because it wasnt even that big of a story i was just laughing

5412614 we still made it to our show and we sang a couple songs a cappella because we didnt have our sound guy with us but regardless we still showed to the people we could sing we could perform no matter what the circumstances are we performed in front of 75 000 people with no track just live a cappella
5412615 you have to go through ups and downs in front of video cameras
5412616 no one was safe in the show anyone could be gone the next day we always had that fear that you could be kicked out at any moment

5412623 you just got to have faith that theres a reason
5412624 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
5412625 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
5412626 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families
5412627 we owe a debt of gratitude to congressman farr for his continuing support of these critical programs
5412628 silver star is exactly the kind of local project that federal dollars should support
5412629 i visited their facilities in january and spoke with the kids who are being helped by the programs and it was a very touching time i will continue to support silver star its one of the few bright lights in our battle against gang violence
5412630 keeping the central coasts military presence on the cutting edge has been a top priority of mine
5412631 from fort hunter liggett in the south to dli and nps in the north our active duty presence is vital to military readiness and im pleased to have funds included in this bill for important programs
5412632 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
5412633 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations

5412635 i was raised in an artistic atmosphere my mother was an active professional artist when i was growing up
5412636 as i grew older i always wondered why there was not some way the historic rite of evolving artistic expression could be made simpler
5412637 my mother not only raised me with a sense of creative artistic expression but with a sense of lifes meaning
5412638 i kept remembering the problems i had witnessed among artists as they tried to bring their creative talents to society
5412639 we give everyone an uninhibited way to publicly exhibit their talent at whatever level in doing so we give them three things a sense of accomplishment self worth and positiveness
5412640 the government any government can not be the arbiter of what information a journalist needs to produce a thorough well researched and fair account of any event
5412641 journalists the world over are deeply troubled by the decision of the chinese government and the acquiescence of the international olympics committee
5412642 the olympic games demonstrate to the world how peoples can work and play together therefore it is very important that journalists everywhere have an opportunity to tell the world fully and accurately about these games

5412646 certainly obamas votes indicate a willingness to raise taxes and obama has not been shy about saying explicitly that he will raise some taxes
5412647 and i found this fascinating maria that on the issue of taxes he looked to insulate himself by saying that if in fact economic conditions justify the fact that it might harm the economy he might be willing to hold off some of his tax increases when he takes office in january lets take a listen to barack obama
5412648 even though senator obamas plan eliminates individual income taxes for seniors with incomes less than 50 000 his plan would raise taxes for almost 10 million senior households over a third of the total not shown in table on average seniors would face a tax increase of about 2 percent of income

5412666 tantra yoga is a holistic approach to the study of the universal from the point of view of the individual the study of the macrocosm through the study of the microcosm tantra yoga draws on all the sciences astronomy psychology mathematics geometry and so on to provide a practical means of realizing the highest ideals of philosophy in daily life instead of separating and categorizing the different areas of human knowledge tantra yoga draws them together
5412667 the basics of tantra yoga are as follows you sit calmly and purify your mind and heart of any wayward thoughts and feelings then slowly begin to sense the life force that is within your being you are then supposed to direct love and all the devotion you can towards the dynamic body of light which is a representation of your soul through practice of this form of yoga you should feel an amazing renewal and an acceleration of spiritual awakening
5412668 tantra yoga has become especially popular recently in the united states with the primary theory being that there is a great vein that runs from the lowest part of the spine where the serpent power of kundalini rests in tantra it is considered that the greatest source of energy in the entire universe is that of regular and important sexual and ritualized intercourse and that an orgasm for instance is considered as being an extraordinary cosmic and divine experience

5412680 voters deserve to know my positions on the issues and jim inhofe needs to be accountable for his 22 year voting record in washington
5412681 sen inhofe says these things but he has voted 17 times against measures to improve our troops benefits at home and to upgrade their armor on the battlefield he has voted against medicare funding 18 times and he has voted against shifting tax incentives to clean energy technologies
5412682 tonight i am challenging jim inhofe to a series of at least six regional debates so that oklahoma voters can make an informed choice this november
5412683 i cant believe he did what he did he was a good caring person
5412684 he did a foolish thing he wrecked his family and ruined the lives of his children
5412685 why did they have to put those two bullets in him after the attack was over
5412686 im very sad today at first my parents were angry with me because i cried over his death but now they are consoling me because the media are harassing me im reliving the entire episode after eight years
5412687 he loved me and i loved him we were each others first love he wasnt violent all the time only when he had a reason to be jealous
5412688 i loved him despite what he did to me he was everything to me during that time
5412689 i have two daughters and they are both married to arabs one lives in the arab village of taiba

5412695 the prime minister needs to resign from his position and hand the reins to someone else someone more competent who cares about this country
5412696 and this is not just me many people call us and tell us that theyre embarrassed to see this government setting these terrorists free
5412697 it is unprecedented that these terrorists live here at our expense study and have a normal community life in jail and then they are freed to carry out more terrorist attacks we face a cruel enemy and we need to think of changing the way we handle them
5412698 we couldnt sit home and watch them handing hizbullah the murderer of my brother

5412721 a unified border agency will make our borders even stronger with tougher policing powers ukba officers will be able to work closely with the police protecting the country from illegal immigration organised crime and terrorism
5412722 roger baker has experience of policing at the border in his role as chief constable of essex police and his skills will be invaluable in ensuring ukba delivers in its role
5412723 with this crucial police support alongside tougher checks at our border and the approaching roll out of id cards for foreign nationals there will be a triple ring of security around britain
5412724 maintaining security of our border is paramount to the security of the uk and i am proud to have been appointed to represent the police on uk border agency board
5412725 the police already work closely with the border and immigration agency and customs colleagues at ports and airports across the uk as the chief constable of essex police i have had first hand experience of building those important relationships required to tackle crime at the border and i am looking forward to using my skills and expertise to help ensure ukba deliver safety and security to the public
5412726 today 430 000 whites of a total white population of 4 5 million are
5412727 i am shocked and surprised by what i have seen here the vast number of black poverty does not mean that we must ignore white poverty which is increasingly becoming an embarrassment to talk about
5412728 this is not about politics its about people who are poor who are in need and want to be helped by government
5412729 all wealthy south africans are no longer white and all poor south africans are no longer black
5412730 but white poverty is silent poverty it is not politically correct to talk about it making it probably the only poverty in the world that is politically incorrect
5412731 therefore i say to you do not worry about your life what you will eat or what you will drink nor about your body what you will put on is not life more than food and the body more than clothing look at the birds of the air for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feeds them are you not of more value than they which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature so why do you worry about clothing consider the lilies of the field how they grow they neither toil nor spin and yet i say to you that even solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these now if god so clothes the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is thrown into the oven will he not much more clothe you o you of little faith therefore do not worry saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or what shall we wear for after all these things the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knows that you need all these things but seek first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you therefore do not worry about tomorrow for tomorrow will worry about its own things sufficient for the day is its own trouble

5412791 3 interesting but is this a solution looking for a problem
5412792 folks are working hard to improve oxygen on the moon
5412793 the forest services own standard adopted to avoid a threatened species listing for the islands wolf is in the way of its ambition to expand its tongass timber program
5412794 we think it is no accident that the forest services deer habitat modeling errors all work in one direction consistently overestimating habitat by as much as 120 percent and consequently underestimating logging impacts
5412795 the forest service has misapplied the science and has stonewalled all challenges
5412796 we have sought resolution from the agency for several years now the courts are the only recourse
5412797 who would you most like to kill with a rusty coat hangar
5412798 we thought the character for jail would turn people off but that turned out to be the big appeal
5412799 the republican party unfortunately is helping this phenomenon by infighting at a level heretofore unseen in recent politics and to its own detriment
5412800 we are reaching out to the hollywood community to do what we can to ensure their safety and security
5412801 we are very discreet when it comes to our buyers
5412802 i can say there are some high profile people looking at the building
5412803 paparazzi dont go into buildings to get shots they wait until people go out and about i have yet to see a paparazzi shot that came from the inside of a private residence
5412804 then they will follow their cars and it will be like any other day in the field
5412805 they always try to get in but they have not been successful
5412806 the only prenatal omega 3 dha derived from an all natural vegetarian source
5412807 know my son with how little wisdom the world is governed
5412808 russia has invaded a sovereign neighboring state and threatens a democratic government elected by its people such an action is unacceptable in the 21st century
5412809 government is at a stand little better practiced now than three or four thousand years ago
5412810 our foreign policy is something that is concocted in washington dc but it reflects the perceptions of our political elite about what we the people want
5412811 and what we want by and large is this continuing flow of very cheap consumer goods we want to be able to pump gas into our cars regardless of how big they may happen to be and we want to be able to do these things without having to think about whether or not the books are balanced at the end of the month or the end of the fiscal year
5412812 one of the ways we avoid confronting our refusal to balance the books is to rely increasingly on the projection of american military power around the world to try to maintain this dysfunctional system or set of arrangements that have evolved over the last 30 or 40 years
5412813 i think historians a hundred years from now will puzzle over how it could be that the united states of america the most powerful nation in the world as far back as the early 1970s came to recognize that dependence on foreign oil was a problem posed a threat compromised our freedom of action how every president from richard nixon down declared were going to fix the problem but none of them did
5412814 the clearest statement of what i value is found in the preamble to the constitution there is nothing in the preamble to the constitution which defines the purpose of the united states of america as remaking the world in our image which i view as a fools errand i believe that the framers of the constitution were primarily concerned with focusing on the way we live here the way we order our affairs to try to ensure that as individuals we can have an opportunity to pursue our perhaps differing definitions of freedom but also so that as a community we could live together in some kind of harmony and that future generations would also be able to share in those same opportunities with the current crisis in american foreign policy unless we do change our ways the likelihood that our children our grandchildren the next generation is going to enjoy the opportunities that weve had is very slight because were squandering our power we are squandering our wealth
5412815 the congress especially with regard to matters related to national security policy has thrust power and authority to the executive branch we have created an imperial presidency the congress no longer is able to articulate a vision of what is the common good the congress exists primarily to ensure the reelection of members of congress
5412816 has made our democracy a false one were going through the motions of a democratic political system but the fabric of democracy i think really has worn very thin
5412817 was a fundamental mistake it never should have been undertaken and were never going to do this kind of thing again
5412818 be the moment when we look ourselves in the mirror and see what we have become and perhaps undertake an effort to make those changes in the american way of life that will enable us to preserve for future generations that which we value most about the american way of life

5412867 it is not the critic who counts not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done better the credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena who at best knows in the end the triumph of great achievement and who at the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place will never be with those cold timid souls who know neither victory or defeat

5412872 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
5412873 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
5412874 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families
5412875 we owe a debt of gratitude to congressman farr for his continuing support of these critical programs
5412876 silver star is exactly the kind of local project that federal dollars should support
5412877 i visited their facilities in january and spoke with the kids who are being helped by the programs and it was a very touching time i will continue to support silver star its one of the few bright lights in our battle against gang violence
5412878 keeping the central coasts military presence on the cutting edge has been a top priority of mine
5412879 from fort hunter liggett in the south to dli and nps in the north our active duty presence is vital to military readiness and im pleased to have funds included in this bill for important programs
5412880 this is another example of states being two steps ahead of the federal government with the white house and gop leadership continuing to block environmental bills states are being forced to come up with their own plans
5412881 instead of wasting time debating offshore drilling plans that are opposed by the public and which will do nothing to solve our energy problems the ocean action plan wisely promotes renewable offshore energy and ecosystem based management to ensure our ocean are being administered responsibly and protected for future generations
5412882 in the past three months weve been working with customers that would have had other means in the past
5412883 theyve been coming to us because traditional lending sources have dried up
5412884 were not even directly marketing to people theyre finding us now
5412885 weve had unsolicited offers from at least six hedge funds
5412886 the most fragile businesses go after these cash advance services
5412887 were participating in the downward business environment because were taking the risk that companies will continue to do today what theyve done in the past
5412888 im adding more merchants every day but the pace at which im collecting money back has slowed
5412889 we used to look at the merchants historical sales but now were adding a whole bunch of new factors
5412890 weve had several merchants who have gone out of business because of these advances
5412891 our goal was to use this avenue to help our merchants protect themselves
5412892 take vengeance for the children of israel against the mideanites
5412893 just as great britain gracefully passed its world power status to the united states the united states must look to do them same with india or else face decline in the face of a raising china
5412894 recent accounts of the alleged rise of india barely mention the fact that the countrys 728 per capita gross domestic product is just slightly higher than that of sub saharan africa
5412895 nearly 380 million indians still live on less than a dollar a day
5412896 many serious problems confront india they are unlikely to be solved as long as the wealthy both inside and outside the country choose to believe their own complacent myths
5412897 we should hope india the worlds largest democracy can do even better

5412947 restricting the use of this sonar jeopardizes the navys ability to train sailors and marines for wartime deployment during a time of ongoing hostilities bush administration lawyers said in their appeal to the high court but environmentalists point to the dead whales that washed ashore in the bahamas the canary islands and madeira islands after the navy conducted war games nearby some of them appeared to have died of hemorrhages in and around their ears brains and lungs
5412948 the balance of power between the executive branch and the courts in resolving such issues in an effort to sidestep the courts the bush administration invoked national security to exempt the navy from strict adherence to the two federal environmental laws that underlay the court decisions
5412949 humans dont really care about any other organisms on this planet in this case the evidence is strong that sonar harms whales yet the attitude of most humans is so what
5412950 were not surprised by the courts willingness to hear the navys appeal but said they remained confident of winning richard b kendall a los angeles lawyer who represented the nrdc pointed out that the justices had recently rejected a similar claim from the administration that the militarys need to hold enemy combatants at guantanamo bay trumps the detainees right to go to court
5412951 i dont expect a good result the supreme court is conservative but what gives us the right to decide the life and death of entire species our brains we dont seem to use them well

5412989 greenpeace is asking kimberly clark to stop flushing away treasured ancient forests to make tissue and toilet paper
5412990 greenpeace will continue to directly communicate with kimberly clark at events like this until the company stops using endangered forests such as the boreal to make disposable products
5412991 kimberly clark is falling behind in not taking the interests of the green consumer seriously
5412992 our members do not want toilet paper that means destruction of caribou habitat and bird nesting sites instead kimberly clark needs to increase the post consumer recycled content of its paper products
5412993 but now more than three years into sectarian conflict and a violent insurgency that has cost nearly 2 400 american lives an investigation of the current state of network centric warfare reveals that frontline troops have a critical need for networked gear gear that hasnt come yet
5412994 we define ncw as an information superiority enabled concept of operations that generates increased combat power by networking sensors decision makers and shooters to achieve shared awareness increased speed of command higher tempo of operations greater lethality increased survivability and a degree of self synchronization in essence ncw translates information superiority into combat power by effectively linking knowledgeable entities in the battlespace
5412995 the air ground collaboration is one of dozens of different ways that network centric tools are slowly starting to rejigger the militarys hidebound hierarchies in the gulf war the various armed services didnt talk to one another much except at the highest levels thats partly why there was a six week air campaign and then a ground attack during the 2003 invasion the air and ground assaults struck at once

5413043 please understand the price of oil is set by commodity traders opec and other oil producers often it is not realistic or reflective of the real oil supply demand situation

5413048 love him or hate him and there seem to be propeller members on both sides of that equation karl rove is usually capable of raising the collective temperature here
5413049 just who in hell does that punk congressional committee think they are in summoning the great and powerful rove he answers to no government lackeys only to king george
5413050 congress does indeed have the power to compel roves testimony or jail him for contempt executive privilege be damned its tough when its near 50 50 partisan like it is but neither bush nor rove have done representatives any favors lately so thats where its at
5413051 in the due course of carrying out his duties in office the president is entitled to have his communications kept private or his office would become subordinate to congress congress has the same privileges in its communications

5413059 they used all these same arguments to keep blacks and women from serving for decades guess what the us military did not fall into a black hole when blacks or women were added to the service nor did the navy quit functioning properly when women started serving on ships and flying combat planes

5413061 i think all this hollering about activist judges or legislatures not listening to the will of the people is a smoke screen yall simply think gay marriage is wrong and what you really want is a federal ban on gay marriage so even states wont be able to decide for themselves
5413062 he prefaced his comments by stating that mccains service was nothing but exemplary patriotic and admirable however the experience of being shot down and taken prisoner does not really give one any particular reason to assume that person would make a good chief executive

5413080 the need for these services will continue to rise as both e commerce expands and hackers and attackers become more sophisticated and aggressive with their plans

5413083 finally an off duty soldier took a gun from a security guard at the scene and shot the terrorist who cried
5413084 i was bicycling from the center of town westward towards my home when i saw a bulldozer battering a bus lying on its side and a lot of commotion i immediately realized that it was a terrorist attack i threw the bicycle to the side and i ran towards the scene trying to get as close as i could to the bulldozer so that i could get on it and stop the driver as i got closer i tried to somehow get a weapon when the bulldozer stopped a policeman climbed up and i climbed up right behind him screaming at him to shoot
5413085 oron ben shimon with whom i was privileged to cooperate in stopping the terrorist also climbed up and he and the policeman tried to stop him with their hands at first i could not shoot him because the policeman stood in between us and the terrorist the terrorist suddenly got up and started to drive again screaming out allahu akbar and oron was able to turn the steering wheel so that the bulldozer wouldnt run over more cars finally i was able to grab orons gun and shoot over the heads of the policeman and oron three bullets to his head then a yassam policeman got on and fired again to ascertain his death
5413086 then i will exert myself to form my own judgment

5413098 governor schwarzeneggers visit to big sur today is a significant indicator of the impact the basin complex fire is having on the people of the central coast and california the people and businesses of the big sur community have shown courage resourcefulness and generosity as this difficult fire has unfolded today and in the weeks ahead as i continue to work hard on the budget in sacramento i will stay focused on ensuring funds are available to fight this fire and as we consider next years budget ill continue to advocate for the funding increases for air attack resources as approved by the assembly budget committee in the meantime i and my monterey county district office will work with residents to provide assistance in working with state agencies on fire related issues
5413099 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
5413100 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise
5413101 due to the difficult fiscal times we are facing this funding is vital to continue the services for our youth and families
5413102 we owe a debt of gratitude to congressman farr for his continuing support of these critical programs
5413103 silver star is exactly the kind of local project that federal dollars should support
5413104 i visited their facilities in january and spoke with the kids who are being helped by the programs and it was a very touching time i will continue to support silver star its one of the few bright lights in our battle against gang violence

5413112 we are defining the learning sciences and selling our definition as the national definition
5413113 as the only university with three national education research centers the national center on school choice the national center on performance incentives and the temporal dynamics of learning center vanderbilt and its peabody college is very visible and in a true position of leadership
5413114 everyone is fascinated with how the brain works i think a study of the learning sciences with a connection to medical education biomedical engineering and computer science is the way of the future for us
5413115 the major function and advantage of the lsi is creating a connection between researchers that they wouldnt have otherwise my own role in the center is to ensure a strong connection between the medical center and the universitys other schools were trying to stimulate as many cross connections as possible
5413116 we are always seeking to identify boundary crossers people willing to work at the borders of their own work and cross borders into other areas of work
5413117 its not easy but when it does work its spectacular we created an affiliation category for faculty called lsi investigators the investigators hail from five vanderbilt colleges and 18 departments the goal is to build a true community of scholarship in the learning sciences
5413118 we need to continue to build bridges between basic research in neuroscience and psychology and applied research in education
5413119 thanks to the vanderbilt administrations foresight in creating the lsi the university has placed itself at the forefront of this rapidly growing field

5413127 many of you may be familiar with the neo shaman mckenna who took timothy learys mantle in the late 80s and early 90s as the great psychedelic social illuminator of our time
5413128 all of his work is still in print and available from amazon www amazon com s ref nb s 625 0100665
5413129 i have been reacquainting myself with the master and have recently found a very reliable audio archive from the good people at deoxy

5413131 he whose acts remove lands from the states territories and from its control will be sentenced to death
5413132 a definition of the treason clause in the penal law
5413133 we must make it clear that we are talking about death by a court of law
5413134 the golan heights law from 1981 applies the israeli law on the golan heights as it is a sovereign part of the state of israe the israeli penal code from 1977 defines in clause 97b the term treason a person who caused a territory to be removed from the states sovereignty or enter the sovereignty of a foreign country an act which could lead to a death sentence or life imprisonment
5413135 since prime minister ehud olmert stated that he is holding turkish mediated negotiations with syria which are aimed at signing a peace agreement in exchange for handing over the golan heights to syria his acts are similar to a treason offense
5413136 i would be much obliged if you could instruct the police to launch a probe into this matter and if it is found that mr olmert committed this offense you should instruct that he be tried for treason
5413137 there is a sense of entitlement that almost seems to be inbred
5413138 they are convinced hillary is the one who should be assuming the mantle and its tough to crack that
5413139 its not something that i would have recommended but theyre trying to bend over backwards as far as they can to accommodate her
5413140 i think the roll call will be a cathartic moment
5413141 there will be a lot of people who will say oh what might have been and will vote for obama but there will be a lot of tears
5413142 were not going to win by pretending problems with barack obama dont exist he has a huge problem connecting with ordinary americans who think he doesnt understand me he is not modest he is arrogant he radiates elitism
5413143 he has provided her with a pittance compared to what the clintons have given obama
5413144 her debt could have been cleared within 10 days its ungracious

5413148 we have the current bush administration who fabricated evidence to justify bushs hellbent desire to kick iraqs ass
5413149 hussein was no more of a threat than north korea or iran
5413150 as explained above the president determined that it was necessary following september 11 to create an early warning detection system fisa could not have provided the speed and agility required for the early warning detection system
5413151 resident clinton then proceeded to initially lie and evade questioning about his transgressions and eventually he was impeached but not convicted for this affair and deceit
5413152 to establish a program to support a transition to democracy in iraq
5413153 it should be the policy of the united states to support efforts to remove the regime headed by saddam hussein from power in iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic government to replace that regime
5413154 the congress urges the president to call upon the united nations to establish an international criminal tribunal for the purpose of indicting prosecuting and imprisoning saddam hussein and other iraqi officials who are responsible for crimes against humanity genocide and other criminal violations of international law
5413155 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program
5413156 he will use those weapons of mass destruction again as he has ten times since 1983
5413157 saddam hussein has been engaged in the development of weapons of mass destruction technology which is a threat to countries in the region and he has made a mockery of the weapons inspection process
5413158 hussein has chosen to spend his money on building weapons of mass destruction and palaces for his cronies
5413159 if saddam rejects peace and we have to use force our purpose is clear we want to seriously diminish the threat posed by iraqs weapons of mass destruction program
5413160 because the people who own our government want it that way
5413161 we cant solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them
5413162 there has not been a single terrorist attack on u s soil since 9 11
5413163 declare no principle and define no rights but they are for practical purposes worth a hundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty
5413164 one of the worst decisions in the history of this country
5413165 i have given it careful thought since i voted said commented on fill in the blank since then i have listened to and consulted with friends advisors and the public and i have decided that my original thoughts beliefs on fill in the blank were wrong misguided or say things have changed since then and i am changing my position on fill in the blank and heres why
5413166 the point you seem to have been originally making is that the actions of the current administration whether or not they can be proven to have been illegal have had cataclysmic consequences and a failure to hold those responsible to account not only withholds justice from those who have suffered those consequences but also establishes a precedent that could lead to additional consequences in the future
5413167 about going after the commander and chief of the military
5413168 when if you realize that the people who disagree with you can have just as much knowledge background experience and ability as you do in a given area then people will talk to you seriously
5413169 so dont assume you deserve to know anything about everything because you dont and some things are better left in hiding and out of the public
5413170 we need as americans take back the country from the politicians who in the end will end up making this a nanny state telling us all what to do and where to go
5413171 some things are better left in hiding and out of the public
5413172 hear about the 550 metric tons of yellowcake uranium found in iraq no why should you it doesnt fit the medias neat story line that saddam husseins iraq posed no nuclear threat when we invaded in 2003 its a little known fact that after invading iraq in 2003 the u s found massive amounts of uranium yellowcake the stuff that can be refined into nuclear weapons or nuclear fuel at a facility in tuwaitha outside of baghdad in recent weeks the u s secretly has helped the iraqi government ship it all to canada where it was bought by a canadian company for further processing into nuclear fuel thus keeping it from potential use by terrorists or unsavory regimes in the region this has been virtually ignored by the mainstream media yet as the ap reported this marks a significant step toward closing the books on saddams nuclear legacy seems to us this should be big news after all much of the early opposition to the war in iraq involved claims that president bush lied about weapons of mass destruction and that saddam posed little if any nuclear threat to the u s this more or less proves saddam in 2003 had a program on hold for building wmd and that he planned to boot it up again soon saddam acquired most of his uranium before 1991 but still had it in 2003 when invading u s troops found the stuff that means saddam held onto it for more than a decade why he hoped to wait out u n sanctions on iraq and start his wmd program anew this would seem to vindicate bushs decision to invade

5413174 being a mom is the best feeling in the world
5413175 many teen moms and the adults who deal with them are glad to see a conversation about teen pregnancy out in the open
5413176 but they say that big parts of the story are being glossed over how that baby bump came to be in the first place and just how hard itll be for a teen to raise a child
5413177 i had a baby at 16 it was not easy i did not look radiant and beautiful
5413178 in these barren thoughtless times dawkins gives people something substantial to chew on
5413179 his audience is surprisingly grateful and also relieved to see someone slapping creationists about and tossing them into the primordial soup as well as explaining atheism positively
5413180 the most important idea to occur to the human mind
5413181 it is weird in many ways that natural selection is still debated
5413182 but it is not debated by anyone who knows anything about it
5413183 i dont like giving them the oxygen of respectability the feeling that if theyre up on a platform debating with a scientist there must be real disagreement
5413184 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5413185 young researcher says there is strong interest in learning how low carb diets treat obesity disease
5413186 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5413187 couldnt manage his daily run while on the low carb diet
5413188 this research in no way suggests that a high fat low carb regime is going to give them heart failure
5413189 extreme unbalanced diets are a major insult on their bodies metabolism and as this study indicates may have direct effects on their hearts
5413190 the way americans are going low fat is very unhealthy they have a very high glycemic load theyre taking sugar theyre taking white bread theyre taking white rice and pasta that certainly isnt the answer
5413191 this study suggests that neither a low fat dietary pattern nor a typical low carbohydrate dietary pattern is ideal with regards to risk of coronary heart disease both have similar risks however if a diet moderately lower in carbohydrates is followed with a focus on vegetable sources of fat and protein there may be a benefit for heart disease
5413192 the pathology of heart disease is not all that different in men and women
5413193 weve seen that developers can have difficulties learning the syntax of lambda expressions

5413199 if it doesnt lead to marriage it leads to splitsville
5413200 theres been a sea change in societal cultural and individual acceptance of cohabitation
5413201 cohabitators 20 years ago were the rule breakers the rebels the risk takers the folks who were perhaps not as interested in marriage and using cohabitation as an alternative to marriage
5413202 twenty or 25 years ago if you were cohabiting and then married them the marriage was more likely to dissolve and end in divorce
5413203 today thats not the case you can cohabit with your spouse and not experience increased risk of divorce were making these finer distinctions that we didnt make before

5413250 the general sentiment around here is that any time a paparazzo gets his camera smashed or gets popped in the face or gets dunked in the water were all for it
5413251 it used to be that celebrities like chris martin or sean penn or alec baldwin had to fight off the paparazzi themselves
5413252 but weve seen an increase in incidents like the one with surfers in malibu or clubgoers in new york who take the side of a star whos just trying to chillax
5413253 ive made 94k a year and im only four months into it because stupid white trash people like your fat mother buy the magazines we hunt the very people you worship for no reason

5413257 the common theme seems to be that one of the weekend days the two sides are going to come together
5413258 i think that surfers always feel some ownership of the beaches that they frequent and so there is some ego there
5413259 also it is at the core a sport which requires concentration and the proper environment if the paparazzi were swarming a golf course which they have started doing too youd hear about angry golfers whacking at cameras with five irons
5413260 the groups have gotten bigger and bigger and can represent a danger to the community i think keeping paparazzi off the beach is a good idea
5413261 yeah i know the 9 year career wasnt the most impressive however being i was a track guy it was fun and unexpected

5413266 when i was writing this book i was fortunate to have access to this story the so called delmas four came back to south africa as hardened soldiers but were soon incarcerated and facing the death sentence their trial was a sinister conspiracy against them this is a fascinating story and a sad story whether i wrote it well enough i will leave that to you

5413272 today the differences between andrew rice and his opponent republican sen jim inhofe became even clearer
5413273 this is a classic example of why americans have lost faith in washington
5413274 senator stevens has been very generous to his good friend jim inhofe whom we know is also close to big oil companies now we know that the money may be tainted and i believe our senator needs to come clean
5413275 even though senator stevens legal problems have been known for more than a year senator inhofe still agreed to take his contributions
5413276 if he wants oklahomans to believe he is not part of the problem in washington inhofe should return the contributions he received from his indicted friend
5413277 stopped for petrol their eery images on this cctv footage show them behaving pause for dramatic effect as if nothing is wrong
5413278 its not every day that a gust of wind can uproot a tree but

5413286 you play piano its very conceivable youll love and be good at surgery

5413288 dirty dinosaur power plants they should realize that is certainly not being nice and
5413289 im tired of being part of a church that lacks integrity
5413290 i love my church and i dont want to leave it but i cant be part of a church that is willing to portray a god that is so hateful i would rather be forced out
5413291 its a matter of integrity and a matter of what it is to be a pastoral ministry
5413292 i ran the wrong kind of business but i did it with integrity
5413293 there are those who wish to use children and schools as social engineers with a view to creating a different society but we should not even be trying to do such things
5413294 children need to be nurtured educated and cared for not thrown into the frontline of social reform muddled thinking is guaranteeing failure for the noble aspirations we all commonly hold for the education of the young
5413295 simply do not have the contact time to create behaviours and attitudes within children they are not and cannot be social engineers and social workers and surrogate parents as well as subject teachers all rolled into one

5413310 one of the most extremist members of the u s senate
5413311 state senator andrew rice d ok is running a strong campaign against one of the most extremist members of the u s senate james inhofe who raked in 12 550 from the telecoms this year and was determined to grant them retroactive immunity and positively giddy about giving the government the right to listen in to all phone conversations and read all e mails without a court order andrew disagrees strongly
5413312 congress must remain vigilant in order to protect americans from another terrorist attack however the bill that is before congress this week bargains away the privacy of law abiding american citizens while protecting the companies that allegedly participated in the presidents illegal wiretapping program the senate should stick to the narrow fix it set out to accomplish by making it clear that the government does not have to obtain a warrant to listen to foreign to foreign communications instead this bill allows a significant expansion of the foreign intelligence surveillance act so that government can eavesdrop on the international communications of innocent american citizens since losing my brother on 9 11 i have vowed to improve americas anti terrorism capability without sacrificing the freedoms that so many americans have died to protect
5413313 senator inhofe voted on wednesday to protect private insurance companies at the expense of seniors military families and their physicians
5413314 if he doesnt want us to believe that he is beholden to one of his largest contributor interest groups then he should return their money
5413315 our u s senator walked away from seniors and military families in order to protect a windfall for insurance companies
5413316 fortunately for oklahomans there were enough democratic and republican senators who voted to protect medicare and tricare

5413378 over the last six months weve seen some nasty parasitic infectors and old school destructive viruses
5413379 our view is that viruses will always be lurking in your desk drawer maybe getting dusty but one day they will catch up
5413380 there is a lag time between when viruses are detected and when they actually become extinct
5413381 and due to internet connectivity many viruses that really shouldnt be prevalent are not yet extinct
5413382 there is such a cyclical nature to malware that we dont like to completely remove the capabilities to deal with them we may disable some based on the fact that most operating systems no longer utilize the old functions those viruses require however we try and leave them in the collection database but consider downgrading their need
5413383 rather than spend nine months redesigning their antivirus the simpler fix is to reduce the amount of malware it addresses until theyre ready with their new engine
5413384 can those who do not turn to god from their ungrateful impenitent life be saved
5413385 fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or chastity in singleness
5413386 fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman or chastity in singleness
5413387 the stay at home dad who is cooed at for his sensitivity but who is as isolated and financially vulnerable as the stay at home mom
5413388 gender should not determine the division of labor at home
5413389 if you gave people a survey they would probably check all the answers about how things should be equal
5413390 with the number of human beings having increased more than sixfold in the past 200 years the modern mind simply assumes that men and women no matter how estranged will always breed enough children to grow the population at least until plague or starvation sets in
5413391 yet for more than a generation now well fed healthy peaceful populations around the world have been producing too few children to avoid population decline that is true even though dramatic improvements in infant and child mortality mean that far fewer children are needed today only about 2 1 per woman in modern societies to avoid population loss birthrates are falling far below replacement levels in one country after the next from china japan singapore and south korea to canada the caribbean all of europe russia and even parts of the middle east
5413392 as governments going as far back as imperial rome have discovered when cultural and economic conditions discourage parenthood not even a dictator can force people to go forth and multiply
5413393 throughout the broad sweep of human history there are many examples of people or classes of people who chose to avoid the costs of parenthood indeed falling fertility is a recurring tendency of human civilization why then did humans not become extinct long ago the short answer is patriarchy
5413394 indeed it is a particular value system that not only requires men to marry but to marry a woman of proper station it competes with many other male visions of the good life and for that reason alone is prone to come in cycles
5413395 the greatly expanded childless segment of contemporary society whose members are drawn disproportionately from the feminist and countercultural movements of the 1960s and 70s will have no genetic legacy
5413396 falling fertility is also responsible for many financial and economic problems that dominate todays headlines
5413397 the long term financing of social security schemes private pension plans and health care systems has little to do with people living longer instead the falling ratio of workers to retirees is overwhelmingly caused by workers who were never born
5413398 among states that voted for president george w bush in 2004 fertility rates are 12 percent higher than in states that voted for senator john kerry
5413399 as has happened many times before in history it is a transformation that occurs as secular and libertarian elements in society fail to reproduce and as people adhering to more traditional patriarchal values inherit society by default
5413400 patriarchal societies come in many varieties and evolve through different stages
5413401 what they have in common are customs and attitudes that collectively serve to maximize fertility and parental investment in the next generation
5413402 patriarchal control over women tends to increase their specialization in reproductive labor with important consequences for both the quantity and the quality of their investments in the next generation
5413403 those consequences arguably include more children receiving more attention from their mothers who having few other ways of finding meaning in their lives become more skilled at keeping their children safe and healthy
5413404 the great difference in fertility rates between secular individualists and religious or culture conservatives augurs a vast demographically driven change in western societies
5413405 yet these are examples of insecure societies that have degenerated into male tyrannies and they do not represent the form of patriarchy that has achieved evolutionary advantage in human history under a true patriarchal system such as in early rome or 17th century protestant europe fathers have strong reason to take an active interest in the children their wives bear that is because when men come to see themselves and are seen by others as upholders of a patriarchal line how those children turn out directly affects their own rank and honor
5413406 a sizable part of the communion is in error and not a few are apostate
5413407 clearly the bedrock of the revisionist perspective is the humanist rather than theological approach this is the crux of the problem they are going in the opposite direction from what biblical orthodoxy demands and with such a mindset a meeting point with those who are labeled conservatives who have chosen to stand where the bible stands becomes a very remote possibility
5413408 rejecting all entreaties lambeth palace chose not to be bothered about that which troubles us decided to stick to its own plans and to erect the walls of the 2008 lambeth conference on the shaky and unsafe foundations of our brokenness
5413409 were not dealing with the secular world here we are dealing with the christian church and the christian church has a constitution which is the bible
5413410 having survived the inhuman physical slavery of the 19th century the political slavery called colonialism of the 20th century the developing world economic enslavement we cannot we dare not allow ourselves and the millions we represent to be kept in a religious and spiritual dungeon
5413411 we will not abdicate our god given responsibility and simply acquiesce to destructive modern cultural and political dictates

5413646 silver star is our long term solution to the gang problems on the central coast we must have firm enforcement to keep our communities safe now but unless we pair that with serious prevention efforts we will never be tackling the root of the problem
5413647 like any education or health initiative we have to set children on the right path at an early age silver star aims to do just that through all of its programs and dedicated staff they do a great job and are worthy of praise

5413674 the ones who dont respond to classroom instruction get something else or something more from the teacher or reading coach or other school personnel
5413675 the students who are still unresponsive either qualify for special education by virtue of their unresponsiveness or are provided a comprehensive evaluation to determine special education eligibility depending on the version of rti used
5413676 they argue that rti provides help more quickly to a greater number of struggling students
5413677 and by providing more intensive instruction to these students rti also distinguishes poorly performing students with disabilities from those who perform poorly because of inadequate instruction
5413678 important questions are being asked about whether teachers will indeed implement scientifically validated instruction with fidelity and whether they and their support staff will correctly identify at risk students
5413679 in math for example children who received tutoring for 20 weeks 3 times per week developed much stronger skills for solving computation problems concept application problems and word problems than their non tutored atrisk peers many fewer tutored children were identified as having a math disability
5413680 rti has been a useful notion to help researchers like myself and my colleagues at the ld center re think methods of identifying children at risk for severe reading and math problems
5413681 and if we can identify them more quickly we can help them sooner
5413682 states and local school districts are currently in the awareness stage of rti adoption although the iris rti modules were originally developed for tennessee osep is now directing educators nationwide to them because they provide a good overview as well as technical practice on how to implement the tier assessments

5413737 the maverick a misnomer if ever there was one is showing just how much faith he has in campaign finance reform which is to say none at all
5413738 so good to know obama has faith in campaign finance reform well not this time maybe in 2016
5413739 unfortunately neither of the candidates have ultimate control of campaign spending fund raising or tactics what may be well meaning honest candidates enter the fray and suddenly become puppets of the party
5413740 while i do agree that neither candidate has as you put it ultimate control they both do have the ability to exert a great deal of influence over how the money is spent

5413753 in fact your brain cant directly know where your body ends and the world begins
5413754 your brain constantly makes predictions about the very fabric of the world we live in and it does so in a parallel fashion what we perceive that is how the world appears to us does not come solely from our senses what we perceive is a combination of what we sense and our brains memory derived predictions

5413802 in linking bullets to guns and guns to incidents and to criminals it will lift the curtain on the shady world of gun toting criminals and gangs helping police to get them and their weapons off our streets
5413803 the national ballistics intelligence service will be a valuable tool to assist the police in dealing with gun crime effectively
5413804 the efficient intelligence that will be provided by nabis will help the police to detect the perpetrators of gun crime quickly allowing us to remove them and the guns from our streets
5413805 in time this mechanism will help prevent gun crime and restore confidence and reassurance to communities across the country

5413813 jimmy of course were supportive but as ive mentioned there is no end with the negative nancies you or we can blog until the cows come home and it wont make a bit of difference with them its exactly like throwing gasoline on a fire
5413814 i dont want the controversy here kimkins members can post supportively on your kimkins interview at the llvlc blog if they wish but honestly i would prefer that members stay out of the arguments on all sites theres nothing to be gained overall
5413815 kimkins com is my home we have our work to do here id like the discourse criticism and negativity left at the door please
5413816 sorry i am not starving dont you have something to do
5413817 what i dont want are kimkins members to write anything at any website even remotely similar to the tone of kimmerexias posts leave negativity to the pros
5413818 edit from kevin sorry to redact this but i think that comment may have been by a spoofer
5413819 kimmer name as that is already taken so how could someone else

5413828 as long as were some of us anyway trying to lighten the mood here a bit i thought youd all enjoy the oddity of this
5413829 shes going to choose this medium to finally engage you people
5413830 kimmer i just want to meet you so i can hug your neck
5413831 and nothing more needs to be said from me or anyone else from kinkims
5413832 curiously wonder if hell use k e to achieve his onderland goal anyway
5413833 jimmy sold out to save his reputation and his job i can understand that
5413834 no matter who kimmer is the plan has worked for so many members
5413835 its funny because every time she gets defensive she throws food up in peoples faces
5413836 oh and people sent her the pictures that were posted with that they relinquish ownership of said pictures so her to say she had to remove them for that reason is stupid if they didnt want them posted they would not have sent them to her duh
5413837 hope doing it alone will not be hard for you
5413838 its a shame you are such a bitter person and so closed minded
5413839 save the prayer and the dribble i do not think you are sincere
5413840 its a shame you are such a bitter person and so closed minded
5413841 this is why alot of people shy away from forums you never know when you are going to be jumped on or say what is considered the wrong thing
5413842 kimmerexia whoever you are you rock if youre on the alc forum make yourself known to me muhahahaha
5413843 save the prayer and the dribble i do not think you are sincere

5413848 p2p applications are an emerging and important form of telecommunications in fact their efficiency and adaptability mean that they may become the dominant means of communication in the future
5413849 as a technology still in its relative infancy it is unclear what innovative and essential applications p2p protocols may eventually facilitate
5413850 should the commission countenance bells current approach to traffic shaping it will effectively place bell and other incumbent carriers in a position to decide which of the new and constantly emerging applications will receive widespread uptake
5413851 i personally think its going to be okay but i have some exploring to do
5413852 i find it rather confusing and i had just gotten used to the old format it kinda feels like im the person who had just finished cleaning up a big mess and all of a sudden drunken coke fueled monkeys are released in the room with a pile of mud
5413853 i think we all would have been ok with improvements but a complete 180 was a bit unexpected the new format has few of the features of the old propeller and requires much more time and effort to navigate
5413854 maybe when i wake up tomorrow it will all be back to normal
5413855 touching story but that doesnt qualify him as a great presidential candidate
5413856 my heart has always gone out to mccain and all of the men women who were pows then and now they get all of my respect for their sacrifices and service to their country however its not enough to get me to vote for any of them for president
5413857 with all due respect mccain is one tough honorable sob hes served his country met barbarism face to face and still remains an exceedingly kind compassionate person
5413858 ml2007 had a good chortle over the oval offices unintentional promotion of a rival agenda
5413859 now the whole truth comes around amazing how that seems to happen even to a propeller socialist like obama
5413860 on another note malakai agrees with obama on timeline and is excited that he agrees its on the wire its history now
5413861 mccains position was that he wanted to bask in the iraqi sun for another 100 years and obama wanted a timetable for withdrawal and he spelled it out and iraqi prime minister accepted it
5413862 i liked mccain back when he hated bush but i guess they neutered him
5413863 some are sounding pretty jubilant about all this but what it means is that if either obama or mccain get in which is virtual certainty we will be engaging in an escalation of the conflict in afghanistan a conflict which may well expand into pakistan sorry but i am not feeling like this is a good thing
5413864 it is very hard on my daughter in fact i am living with her for support until he returns this time imagine every day not knowing where your spouse is or how he is

5413887 no need to be rude they are only trying to make a living
5413888 well find out when ive accomplished some of my goals and youre done with school
5413889 why is mia still in school why hasnt she settled down with that nice boy shes the oldest of the grand kids and nothing from her yet when is she going to have a baby
5413890 mia said shit right underneath one of the stations of the cross
5413891 mia were calling for pizza what do you want on yours
5413892 so youre 4ft 11 but how big are your breasts
5413893 thank you for reminding me how small my breasts are
5413894 no no im not looking i didnt look im just saying
5413895 i dated a girl who was 4 ft 11 and she had double fs
5413896 i had a friend like that in high school laurie same height as me and she was like triple something halfway down the alphabet
5413897 the high court spat in the faces of the bereaved families who lost their loved ones in samir kuntars terror attack and spat on the graves of our loved ones
5413898 we are very disappointed insulted and hurt by the discriminatory treatment given to our pain compared to the pain of others it cant be that they wouldnt even listen to us
5413899 abuse of terror victims who come to demand that their brothers cries from the grave for justice are heeded
5413900 is an arch murderer whom we cannot give a prize to by releasing him even after 30 years let them give back bodies for bodies and not set free a murderer like kuntar
5413901 the very moment of glorious jewish victory in 1967 was the beginning of a flight to shame
5413902 he who controls the temple mount controls jerusalem and he who controls jerusalem controls the holy land
5413903 said rabbi shimon ben lakish he who becomes merciful unto the cruel is destined to be cruel unto the merciful
5413904 as this war is more of cross between an insurgency and a social movement there maybe no clean cessation of violence in the near or distant future and in this conflict there will be no battlefields but rather our adversaries will be attached as a global swarm as global guerillas
5413905 by now it is surely clear that al qaeda can produce videotapes but not terrorism and the bad guys are losing
5413906 made many threats of course but was never able to back them up creating an unbridgeable credibility gap
5413907 may be an attempt on their part bin laden and ayman al zawahiri to kind of re establish authenticity with their followers
5413908 we are in the throes of the beginning of a new wave in the muslim world the freedom generation in which civil society is asserting itself
5413909 bin laden has never claimed that al qaeda could achieve this goal by itself quite the contrary he has consistently maintained that al qaeda is only the vanguard of the large scale movement that is needed to achieve this goal

5413912 einstein had the genius to view space and time like a child
5413913 his breakthrough realization of the relativity of time turned on a series of mental cartoons featuring trains and clocks general relativity his theory of gravity started off as a meditation on what happens when a man falls off a roof
5413914 when richard feynman faced a problem he was unusually good at going back to being like a child ignoring what everyone else thinks and saying now what have we got here
5413915 watson can himself be quite the double helix a sharp scientific mind intertwined with a child like innocence
5413916 finds a childlike component in each of their creative breakthroughs
5413917 there are children on the streets who could solve some of my most difficult equations because they are not cluttered with all of this garbage
5413918 every child is an artist the problem is how to remain an artist once he grows up
5413919 unlike the early human adult skull with its sloping forehead and prominent jaw the modern human skull with biologically insignificant variations retains into maturity a proportionately large size in relation to the rest of the body a high rounded dome straight planed face and reduced jaw size all closely resembling the characteristics of the skull in the juvenile chimpanzee
5413920 the neotenic hypothesis states that humans are at least in their cranial anatomy biologically juvenile or
5413921 sometimes i ask myself how it came about that i happened to be the one to discover the theory of relativity the reason is i think that the normal adult never stops to think about space and time whatever thinking he may do about these things he will already have done as a small child i on the other hand was so slow to develop that i only began thinking about space and time when i was already grown up
5413922 hidden in this remark is an acceptance of himself as an eternal child this prodigy of thought was eternally a child prodigy and if that would seem to diminish the man remember that it was a child who cried out that the emperor had no clothes all his life einstein would point to this or that ruling thought and reveal its nakedness until finally it was the prevailing universe that had no clothes
5413923 babies are just plain smarter than we are at least if being smart means being able to learn something new they think draw conclusions make predictions look for explanations and even do experiments in fact scientists are successful precisely because they emulate what children do naturally
5413924 with the strength of his spiritual eye and insight grows distance and as it were the space around man his world becomes more profound ever new stars ever new riddles and images become visible for him perhaps everything on which the spirits eye has exercised its acuteness and thoughtfulness was nothing but an occasion for this exercise a playful matter something for children and those who are childish

5413928 employers have begun to tap into these online communities as a simple and inexpensive way to perform background checks on candidates
5413929 however a number of problems arise when employers base adverse employment decisions upon information obtained through these online searches
5413930 because searches of online social networking services such as myspace and facebook only stand to become more prevalent among employers the law must expand to ensure adequate protection to users of these web sites from unfair illegal or arbitrary employment decisions
5413931 employers also stand to gain from such an expansion of legal protections because they will be accountable to make good employment decisions
5413932 lawmakers and policymakers must begin to reconsider the traditional physical conceptions of privacy i e thinking about privacy within physical boundaries such as a home or an automobile in order to meet the demands of the members of this new techsavvy generation that have proven much more apt to share and communicate in the world wide web than their ancestors
5413933 in a world where maintaining absolute discretion in every aspect of ones life seems both impossible and impractical congress must begin to respond by adopting reasonable privacy protection measures these measures should conform to the modern concept of an employees expectation of privacy an expectation that is as strong as ever but now with virtual boundaries rather than purely physical ones

5413935 we are extremely relieved that our two activists have finally been released however our biggest question remains unanswered why did the japanese prosecutor drop his investigation into the compelling evidence of whale meat embezzlement by whaling crew members brought to him by greenpeace we call on the government to reinstate its investigation into the corruption in the whaling fleet
5413936 instead of prosecuting peaceful protesters and those who exposed crimes within the whaling program the government of japan should revoke all southern ocean whaling permits release the activists and order an immediate and independent investigation into the embezzlement scandal
5413937 from the beginning it has been clear that the arrest and detention of junichi and toru has been politically motivated and that powerful forces within the japanese establishment are attempting to silence legitimate peaceful protest in order to protect the so called scientific whaling program
5413938 we have exposed a scandal at the heart of the whaling program involving embezzlement of valuable cuts of whale meat and we have highlighted the massive waste of japanese taxpayers money on the annual so called scientific hunt in the southern ocean whale sanctuary
5413939 while some of the elements that lead to these schools success are unique to the general structure safety and discipline of life on a military base the schools approach to putting themselves at the center of family life and reacting to community stressors can and should be replicated outside of the military
5413940 what we found could provide a roadmap for public education systems even in the era of no child left behind
5413941 the missing piece in the 2001 report was the role that parents the neighborhoods and military culture play in these students success
5413942 to understand these issues we interviewed parents and examined other social factors on military bases
5413943 most enlisted members and their spouses reported that if they knew any parents on post they knew them best from interaction at their childrens school
5413944 indeed more than any other place or program on post the schools emerged as the most critical institutional support and social sanctuary for families
5413945 we found that parents structured and enforced quiet time and space for homework and reinforced the high academic standards at home that are set by teachers at school
5413946 much of the parental involvement takes place in the home
5413947 the social context of success school neighborhood and family structures that support high academic achievement in dodea schools

5413954 between jan 1 2007 and may 15 2008 the campaign paid scheunemann nearly 70 000 to provide foreign policy advice during the same period the government of georgia paid his firm 290 000 in lobbying fees
5413955 who engineered the war in iraq when he was a director of the project for a new american century
5413956 it was scheunemann who after working on the mccain 2000 presidential campaign headed the committee for the liberation of iraq which championed the u s invasion of iraq there are telltale signs that he played a similar role in the recent georgia flare up
5413957 in the 21st century nations dont invade other nations and we will decide in subsequent days who was right and who was wrong
5413958 hi im deaf but i can read lips and id like to talk to you
5413959 honey i havent been drinking wine my aunt knows i hate the stuff this is grape juice
5413960 well i think someone slipped you something because you keep introducing me to the same people over and over again thats the third time youve introduced me to that blonde

5413968 i swear to god robert if you dont clean up this room i am calling michael jackson
5413969 okay robert but i want this room cleaned right now ahora mismo
5413970 hmm not bad it lasted 3 hours usually its destroyed an hour later
5413971 you know robert if you like taking apart your toys i can get you a mr potato head and you can pop his nose on and off just like michael jackson does with his

5413987 no no im not looking i didnt look im just saying
5413988 i dated a girl who was 4 ft 11 and she had double fs
5413989 i had a friend like that in high school laurie same height as me and she was like triple something halfway down the alphabet
5413990 its funny i was just thinking about this the other day
5413991 it may have been nap time in third grade when the teacher would play a sound of the seagulls record maybe its early childhood conditioning
5413992 i used to be able to go to amoeba a couple years ago and go through this really abandoned section at the bottom where the overstock bins were full of new age records and you could get everything for 1 now theyre all 10 and 15 records
5413993 it makes sense in a sports car like the tt and in the future maybe on an r8 an rs model has to have outstanding handling performance the car must be able to have have good records on not just daily driving but also on a race track all quattro gmbh cars go through a durability test on the nurburgring nordschliefe for 8 000km thats where we check the racing abilities and the durability on an rs you also need outstanding quality on the details that means the materials how its crafted
5413994 audi has three distinct levels with standard a models like the a4 a5 and a6 with a range of engines from small to medium sized the s models such as the s4 are defined as the sporty versions of the a cars and then above those we have the rs4 and this is defined as superior performance handling and showing the technically possible this suits very well when you compare to the competitors cars of course we have one thing that they dont have and this is the quattro drivetrain
5413995 the relevance of an rs model on global co2 you can just forget it
5413996 what we will do is to have the most efficient engine the most efficient drivetrain the most efficient car that is possible at that time
5413997 our philosophy is to develop the whole package in that car line for what the customers expect what is the right thing that we would see in that category this is the reason why we are driving in the rs4 a v8 high rev naturally aspirated engine because in a small light car you can position that car louder i mean louder not by noise but louder by positioning the car it can look a little more extreme it can perform a little more extreme it can handle a little more extreme

5414184 today marks a new era of policing police forces right across the country have done a magnificent job delivering this ambitious goal to give every household a dedicated police team i congratulate them
5414185 every community now has a visible contactable and accountable policing team working with local people to keep their neighbourhood safe
5414186 im determined that every person has access to the same level of support and service when it comes to policing that is why we are launching a new policing pledge to give everyone the opportunity to be involved in setting priorities in their area i encourage everyone to get involved and have a say about how their streets are policed
5414187 today marks the start of a fundamentally different approach to policing with the citizen at its heart
5414188 this new approach to policing builds on changes also starting today to slash red tape and reduce central targets for police freeing them up to spend more time on local priorities and tackling serious crimes
5414189 every area now has a team of staff dedicated to listening to local concerns and responding to them although a great achievement for the service it is even better news for the people we serve who are noticing the difference public confidence continues to rise as does the level of awareness amongst local people of who their teams are and how to contact them
5414190 problems faced by communities vary and we need to be realistic that in some cases there are no overnight fixes that said all over england and wales neighbourhood policing teams are making a huge difference to improve peoples lives
5414191 this is a major achievement and credit goes to all police authorities and forces police authorities have worked extensively with their forces to ensure that neighbourhood policing is available and accessible to everyone
5414192 we know from our consultations with communities that they want a visible local policing presence to help solve local crime and disorder problems neighbourhood policing teams working together with other local partners will give them just that and bring the opportunity for people to have a greater say in finding local solutions to local problems
5414193 not by the color of their skin but by the content of their hearts
5414194 the third tier never has to worry about losing an election for being too controversial because they rarely receive enough support to become viable contenders

5414239 were trying to help the government deal more effectively with the coming tidal wave of retirements by federal employees
5414240 we need to tap into the expertise and experience of those employees particularly with positions that are difficult to fill theyve proven their ability their dedication and their desire to help keep government running smoothly
5414241 most retirees today want to remain active and those who choose to do so by sharing their expertise and experience with younger workers and federal agencies should be encouraged not penalized
5414242 this legislation recognizes the new realities in the federal workforce and addresses conditions that could cripple the federal workforce if we dont take action now
5414243 this cutting of the interest rate will benefit the 6 8 million students who borrow need based federal student loans each year once fully phased in this interest rate cut will save the typical student borrower with 13 800 in need based student loan debt an average of 4 400 over the life of the loan

5414248 decades from now the wisdom senators showed today still will be benefiting this great city and area
5414249 nothing gives me more satisfaction in public life than expanding educational opportunities for students
5414250 this program helps motivate students to work harder in school helps motivate their parents to stay in the district and helps motivate the school system to prepare them as well as possible for the challenges that lie ahead in college
5414251 im overwhelmed and blown away by it i cant really take it all in to be honest you make the best record you can and you put it out there and you really dont know whats going to happen or how people are going to react then when you hear stuff like this it just make you feel like its all worthwhile and that it means something to people thats the best thing really not the chart positions so much just knowing that weve made a record that means something to people

5414254 studies of digital visual culture have yet to discuss networking social spaces or power relations in terms of race ethnicity and gender but have done a superb job at parsing the history of digitalitys address to the eye studies from a communications perspective have discussed the dynamics of online interaction quite exhaustively but fail to integrate their findings into readings of what the sites do visually

5414280 other than maybe nixon which president has ever said he regretted what he did in office clinton reagan carter johnson ford or kennedy kennedy almost blew up the planet with his knuckleheaded handling of russia for gods sake and you worship him
5414281 im amazed that he believes that giving a few people the right of judicial review will result in more american deaths too bad he couldnt spell out the logical process behind that it almost reminds me of the way some folks on propeller argue
5414282 if the courts are going to give civil rights to enemy combatants we may as well just kill them in a firefight anything can happen
5414283 if congress really wanted to do something this year besides the non binding resolutions tax increases and cutting the military how about drawing up laws concerning terrorists carter gave non uniformed combatants at that time the plo more protection than regular military troops have dump the un bylaws and create something we all can live with

5414305 this is a victory for us but also for all restaurant workers everywhere who are sick and tired of putting up with discrimination and abuse
5414306 the abuse these three workers suffered was appalling we couldnt just stand by we knew we had to act
5414307 we decided to respond the best way we knew how by protesting in front of the restaurant
5414308 i never thought i would get to tell a corporate vice president about all the abuse that went on in the kitchens but we put the pressure on and they had no choice but to listen to us

5414360 we undertook this research to determine what we could do to change writing achievement and writing instruction in this country
5414361 weve identified 11 strategies as being effective at teaching students how to write and improve their achievement
5414362 we have to widen the literacy spotlight to include writing as well as reading increasing students writing abilities increases their literacy abilities which in turn increases the likelihood that they will stay in school and graduate and that means they have a much better chance for future success
5414363 in our meta analysis we always compared a treatment versus some control or comparison treatment
5414364 we were looking for big ticket effects what kind of interventions changed the overall quality of what students do
5414365 the first one was teaching writing strategies to kids this basically meant teaching kids how to plan how to revise how to edit how to regulate the writing process or a combination of those by doing that the teachers were initially modeling how do this and then students were given assistance as they applied this working toward independence in the use of those strategies so it was systematic it was explicit
5414366 the second procedure that also had a very strong effect was teaching kids directly how to summarize written material
5414367 im not talking about throwing kids together and saying you guys go off and work together these were structured procedures where kids had a clear idea of what they were to do so for example if it was revising they were provided or taught how to carry through on giving feedback to their peers on very specific aspects of their writing
5414368 these are things that can enhance what we already do theres a delivery issue here

5414373 we are saying you know what im rationing my calories or im on a diet but you know what i really want something great i really want something best of class so if i cheat and everybody cheats then im going to cheat with the best thats what we do people cheat with our doughnuts they cheat with h agen dazs ice cream they cheat with mrs fields cookies they cheat with in n out burgers
5414374 if youve gone off your diet if youve cheated a little bit and youve done that its worth it
5414375 were working on a 100 calorie doughnut and a reduced sugar doughnut and the key of course is to make it taste as close to our signature product as you can get you do that two ways one is by using the new sweeteners that are out there today and the second is by reducing the portion you go into any of the stores today in the candy rack all those candy bars are a lot smaller today than they used to be and the calories are lower and the sugars are a lower and the fat calories are lower and thats one way of doing it

5414450 indirectly pakistan through the isi has been supporting terrorism and extremism whether in london on 7 7 or in afghanistan or iraq
5414451 the isi probably would not define what theyve done in the past as terrorism
5414452 the thinking piece of the taliban is out of quetta in pakistan its the major headquarters
5414453 it is the most ridiculous thought that the taliban headquarters can be in quetta
5414454 its access back and forth to afghanistan and the ability to find safe haven
5414455 i do not accept the thesis that the isi is a rogue organization
5414456 its a disciplined army unit that does what its told though it may push the envelope sometimes
5414457 there are extremist groups that are beyond the pale with which the isi has no influence at all
5414458 theyd rather not deal with the afghan taliban as an adversary
5414459 pakistan is genuinely trying to open up relations with india

5414551 realistic visual representations of drugs and their delivery method bringing the science fiction drugs in line with real world drugs
5414552 harry wolcotts book is one of those little must have must read gems the voice of experience is unmistakable its great fun to read and chock full of helpful how to do it advice
5414553 many of these families are in areas that we refer to as food deserts
5414554 we conducted a food audit in the areas surrounding each of the boys and girls clubs and found that healthy fruits and vegetables were far less available than unhealthy items such as candy cigarettes and alcohol its difficult to eat five a day if produce is not available in your community
5414555 at the grocery store the greens dont look as good the leaves might be yellow colored and nine times out of 10 they look dirtier
5414556 sometimes well travel 30 minutes to the harris teeter to find better quality produce but this is much better this is practically in our backyard
5414557 i came to pick up my daughter at the club and was able to shop right here
5414558 it takes our nutrition education programs to another level so we wont just be teaching it and preaching it
5414559 we can show them what were talking about and bring it to them so they can make the right purchases here at the club
5414560 some kids come from an environment where good nutrition isnt a priority survival is with the fresh produce coming in and the opportunity to purchase it without having to go all the way across town this is almost as good as home delivery
5414561 we know that childhood obesity impacts every part of our society but lower income families have more obstacles to overcome
5414562 through the veggie project we were able to bring the right mix of experts together and create a program that can increase knowledge and change behaviors
5414563 there are so many benefits to this program its a perfect example of thinking globally and acting locally
5414564 most fruits and vegetables at grocery stores travel an average of 1 500 miles before they reach your plate our produce travels 60 miles at most its a great way to save on fossil fuels and pollution and it ends up costing everyone less while the goods taste fresher
5414565 to the extreme i rock a mic like a vandal light up the stage and watch me jump like a candle
5414566 i saw him reach down to get his ball and he yelled

5414569 im still very independent but im in a different place now
5414570 ive been dating searching for a partner looking for mr right this album reflects those feelings and that journey
5414571 americans dont care if youve been successful anywhere else they want to know who you are and see what you can do for themselves
5414572 i had to be willing to start over and prove myself from the ground up again
5414573 thats where i learned how to sing with soul and that singing and music is a real vehicle to express and feel you know your access to the spiritual through music
5414574 i hope that when someone listens to my songs they will discover a few different layers
5414575 very exciting my band rocks at the end of the night everyones up
5414576 personne ne veut conna tre lhorreur que mon ami et sa famille ont v cu nous devons soutenir cette campagne nous avons une voix que les jeunes coutent cest malheureux que les crimes larme blanche fassent partie de la vie de la culture actuellement et cest pourquoi nous voulons nous impliquer pour que cela change
5414577 le gouvernement et la police ne pouvaient r gler seuls ce probl me nous devons changer la fa on dont les jeunes consid rent les couteaux nous avons besoin que les familles et les communaut s travaillent ensemble et nous avons besoin de mod les influents
5414578 as we explore our total life fitness then weigh in with your own thoughts over at lauras
5414579 oh enough about me what do you think about me
5414580 buck up kiddo its gonna get a whole lot worse than that
5414581 they are code for dont confront me with things that are unpleasant or dont bother me with your pain
5414582 i say bring the troops home from iraq and immediately deploy them into the forests and woods in the us where the paramilitary groups and neo nazis hang out clean em out put em away
5414583 and the working man isnt voting against the black man because hes black but because we are god fearing ignorant gun toting bigots
5414584 i dont believe obama ever used the term ignorant or implied it at least i never heard him say that and i know that his words have been twisted into something they were never meant to be because he is one of the most empathetic people i have ever had the pleasure of knowing
5414585 i also get the weekly talking points from nancy pelosis secret broadcast in my fillings but i assume everybody gets that
5414586 i remember when he was a regular on tony orlando and dawn okay now i feel old my sister and i would get so excited when his routine came on i was fortunate enough to see him when he came through denver this year got the t shirt with 2 000 dirty words and phrases think ill get it framed now
5414587 i have just seven words as a personal dedication to yah george but unfortunately i cant use them here
5414588 i havent felt so sick over the death of a comedian since blasphemous sam kinison died in that accident between la and vegas may god be merciful
5414589 he was an atheist as far as i know so now that hes probably met his maker and existing somewhere in some other dimension hes probably busy whipping up some fresh new carlinesque material its too bad we wont ever get to hear it straight from the man any mediums in the room
5414590 telling kids to simply not have sex is just like telling them to simply not speed we know that some are going to speed so do we refuse to teach driving skills that will help minimize them having an accident if they happen to speed
5414591 right now our schools are graduating morons they are failing at teaching the basics so why the hell do you think they should teach your kids about sex
5414592 suppressed sexuality burdened with the idea of sin is much more dangerous than the natural discovery of the other sex whenever it is the right time it is very necessary to talk about the dangers of an early pregnancy at school
5414593 they can learn the difference between right and wrong at an early age without introducing the concept of sin which brings with it a goodly amount of guilt
5414594 theres nothing wrong with feeling guilty when youve done something wrong its called a conscience
5414595 yeah lets turn out droves of maladjusted people especially when the hormones say yes yes and they suddenly have this dilemma of a natural urge being called a sin
5414596 let it be dealt with at a local level if a local community wants to abstain great if they want to hand out condoms great let them decide how they want to tackle their problem
5414597 i know the billionaires who feed off the military complex would be very sad if we stopped
5414598 dianne feinstein has been a sock puppet for the military industrial complex because of it shes a dino of the worst kind and an example of the kind of democrat that should be voted out of office
5414599 what our military isnt good for and isnt supposed to be used for and is doomed to fail miserably at no matter what the state of technology may be is engaging in guerrilla warfare and police actions on foreign soil against the indigenous population
5414600 criminals will always be armed disarmed countries like congo are suffering horribly at the hands of armed thugs so i disagree with obama concerning several disarmament issues

5414756 relational dbs have evolved from billions of dollars and millions of hours to find ways to organize and relate information there are many interesting tools techniques hidden in there if your solution to every problem is in code its wrong if your solution to every problem is in the db its wrong the correct answer is knowing how to solve problems leveraging both
5414757 tell the db everything you know in a very complex sql statement and see what it does with it

5414834 i was most interested by the fact that some people in california and elsewhere are vehemently opposed to marriage equality and will stop at nothing to embolden their supporters the reasoning behind why gay marriage is so offensive to some rests solely with religious beliefs and mythical ideas about marriage that it is a heterosexual institution and has traditionally been so is sufficient reason to keep gays and lesbians from marrying however if one uses that logic neither women nor blacks could vote they could not wed one another and we would have slaves picking cotton in the south traditions can and rightly should change those who oppose gay marriage like the ones mentioned in the article fail to understand that position those ideas i found to be most compelling

5414838 an astonished perenchio asked him how they derived those numbers and governor of sonora jos eduardo bours castelo robinson read from a written statement
5414839 in the past our annual economy brought in around fifty million dollars with seventy five percent coming from our wonderful citizens sending money back home from the u s as you can see this economic stimulus package equals many many generations of economic comfort for our state we all of us here in sonora thank george bush for this gift
5414840 the first thing we are going to do is build a big fence between sonora and the u s with this kind of money you never know who might try to sneak across the border into sonora we have also been approached by several u s companies about helping them out such as citibank dean witter and morgan stanley

5414886 the mostly modern images that display here pertaining to the world shaking events and activities of american rebels in their revolutionary battle for liberty on american soil mainly between the years 1775 and 1783 are from flickr
5414887 do i need one of these to listen to podcasts
5414888 it would have been naive to think we could have permanently transcended our differences as americans out of 9 11 but it is not too idealistic to hope that we could have found common ground on how to protect our country and preserve our common values

5414897 there are a lot of us though who find great value in this ongoing noise it helps us get to know people who would otherwise be just acquaintances it makes us feel closer to people we care for but in whose lives were not able to participate as closely as wed like knowing these details creates intimacy
5414898 we are just eating anything we find on the ground i am hungry and i feel really sick we dont have any food to eat
5414899 i am pleased to be here today and wish the officers attending todays academy the best of luck with their training
5414900 its great to see frontline staff being encouraged to solve problems using their personal experiences and to see managers empowered to work creatively with their teams to improve performance and the service to the public
5414901 i have been impressed by what officers in avon amp somerset cheshire lancashire and thames valley have achieved following the last programme today sees the start of similar work in four more forces and i hope overall it will stimulate thinking and improvement more widely in policing in england amp wales
5414902 oh wow im so cool by capitalising the last letter of my first name i bet all those scene kids will copy that style and masturbate to my music
5414903 this is a really good band lolz har har har
5414904 every shooting or stabbing every rape every child sexually abused every case of someone suffering domestic violence is one too many
5414905 we have made good progress violent crime has fallen by 31 since 1997 and the risk of being a victim of serious violence remains extremely low we have set tough targets for the police and local agencies to tackle serious violence giving them more local decision making powers to find solutions to local priorities the challenge now is to ensure that the good practice we have developed is applied as widely as possible to the benefit of everyone in all communities
5414906 police forces together with partners and local communities have been working to tackle the issue of violent crime these efforts have been reflected in the recent british crime survey which highlighted how some crimes of this nature such as homicide wounding and firearms offences have reduced
5414907 the police service as a whole is committed and determined to build on the work already being done and as such has worked with the home office to assist in the development of this plan
5414908 acpo welcomes the home offices action plan published today and we look forward to further collaboration in order to develop the police contribution to the delivery of this plan
5414909 we are encouraged to see the commitment by agencies other than the police in tackling violent crime this clearly recognises that dealing with violence is also an issue for partners and local communities and not just law enforcement
5414910 the victims advisory panel has made a number of recommendations relating to support for victims and suggested that existing good practice be extended to cover more vulnerable victims of violent crime

5415112 april will mark the start of a new kind of relationship between the police service and the public every household will hear from be able to contact and be able to influence their local team we want everyone to have the opportunity to shape their teams priorities i congratulate the police for their progress

5415129 you should have known you were going to hit it on the green
5415130 if you knew you were going to scull it and then you did why not know that you are going to hit a high beautiful pitch that lands softly within six feet of the hole and do that
5415131 what you are saying makes no sense to me just because i thought i was going to scull it over the green doesnt mean that if i thought i was going to hit it right i would do that
5415132 that doesnt make any sense i cant help what im thinking
5415133 i am going to strike this 6 iron in the center of the clubface and hit a majestic arcing shot that lands in the center of the green
5415134 i am going to present my proposal using the presentation that i have put together with confidence i will be very persuasive
5415135 ive been practicing these shots and i know that i can hit it im in a perfect position and im playing very well i am definitely going to hit the shot that i can see in my mind
5415136 the presentation is very good i did a dry run with my sales manager just yesterday and he was impressed the proposal is exactly right for this client and i know that they will see it that way
5415137 aaaaccckk now ill probably make a double bogey and have no chance of breaking 90
5415138 im sure its no problem youll find the ball pitch it out on the fairway knock it on and make the putt for par

5415147 the turnout in february for the presidential primary was high but the july 15 primaries were lower than last time
5415148 people will turn up to vote they just have to have something that interests them
5415149 unfortunately in our laws marriage is recognized so there needs to be some device i believe civil unions is the best device to give equal protection to those who do not have possibility of a marriage service available to them
5415150 i think its a state issue to be honest with you i dont think the federal government should have gotten involved in the first place
5415151 certainly i think a constitutional amendment defending marriage would be inappropriate
5415152 we ought to make sure that there is no discrimination based on sexual identity or gender identity
5415153 i do believe that you have to get some legislation passed i am not so dogmatic i believe i can win everything but i am committed to making sure everyones rights are protected
5415154 it was a mistake military service is an important patriotic duty of all americans and it shouldnt be denied anyone for discriminatory reasons
5415155 i oppose all forms of hate crimes based on sexual orientation
5415156 laws should be strong on the national and state level and should prohibit that behavior and punish it
5415157 people should be able to offer benefits to whomever they wish
5415158 not only would i like to see it happen these sorts of things are what i worked on in the georgia legislature for years

5415161 local members voted to hold off until monday it is mothing to do with the quality of the 2 candidates as irene and doug have an excellent calibre
5415162 if theyre of such an excellent calibre why did local members vote to hold off until monday
5415163 i think local members were perhaps looking for a local candidate which margaret curran is and has a proven track record
5415164 i dont think it is a question of ability between irene and doug as they will be both candidates at a seat in the general election one of which will be winnable

5415265 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5415266 one of the things md thats dr mikes wife mary dan eades and i took away from our intermittent fasting experience is the idea that we dont have to eat three meals per day we now often skip lunch and dont seem any the worse for it sometimes we get up and get going with all our projects and dont eat breakfast we try to skip a meal here and there because we figure its probably good for us when you get used to it you dont really even think about it and its good for you dont take my word for it look at the medical literature
5415267 to the funny farm theyre coming to take me away ha ha theyre coming to take me away ho ho hee hee ha ha
5415268 on the first day i will be useless and shaky for the last few hours of my fast but on the second day i can function normally for much longer and dont need to eat until around the time when i gave in on the first day
5415269 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5415270 finally you might be interested in trying the intermittent fast if you suffer from hypoglycemia
5415271 thats what i was waiting for fellas im all in
5415272 it was very painful the fact that you have someone telling you they will not help you because of who you are that they will deny your right to be a mother and have a family
5415273 it was clear and emphatic that discrimination has no place in doctors offices
5415274 i remain of the view that as a last resort only the control order system as operated currently in its non derogating form is a justifiable and proportional safety valve for the proper protection of civil society
5415275 would have reached the same decision as the secretary of state in each case in which a control order has been made so far as the actual making of the order is concerned
5415276 the government has no higher priority than protecting the public from terrorism control orders remain an important tool to deal with suspected terrorists who cannot be prosecuted or deported
5415277 the prevention of terrorism act 2005 strikes the right balance between safeguarding society and safeguarding the rights of the individual
5415278 i am grateful to lord carlile for his detailed report

5415280 the guidance counselor tells me my son has been using cocaine for three years i had no idea he had a drug problem
5415281 i was arguing with this guy and out of nowhere he sucker punched me i never saw it coming
5415282 i thought the boss was pretty happy with my job performance i had no idea i was going to be fired
5415283 what nonverbal behaviors should i be looking for and what important information do they reveal
5415284 i am not a psychologist here but there seems to be jealousy here and hurt feelings and despite all this alleged evil he apparently never objected or threatened to quit he was fired sour grapes
5415285 the last thing this administration needs is a sycophant like yourself spinning the facts mcclellan resigned his post and did not get dumped
5415286 if there is one person left who has anything good to say about bush that will be your expert to whom you will all flock and keep helping to clean bushs dirty diaper
5415287 im gonna take this for what it is mcclellan may have found religion like former defense secretary mcnamara did in the 90s then again maybe not
5415288 bush himself has already admitted some of the info they used was bad id be more upset with the rep and dem congress that allowed the wool to be pulled over their eyes if i were you
5415289 if we dont strike iran before bush leaves dont count on the democrats to do it striking iran will serve both purposes getting mccain elected and getting regime change going in iran
5415290 you begin to realize that one day the world will stop buying oil from those wacky arabs and they can go back to their tents and camels and leave us alone
5415291 believe it or not cletus much of the middle east has got cities and roads and cars and trucks and even indoor plumbing and beyond that if you followed such things you would know that much of the world has been driving fuel efficient vehicles that get up to 80 mpg but they dont get into the usa nope no sir
5415292 yes israel has nukes has never used them even when it came extremely close to being beaten iran on the other hand is lead by a nutter with a bunch of religious morons controlling said nutter
5415293 while you couldnt trust the soviets on every treaty they understood the concept of mad iran has taken shots at the usa since 1979 i think the average iranian is much like you or i but if his government doesnt share the consequences of using nukes who knows
5415294 im going out soon to fill up before the evening rush hour traffic i know by then they will raise it again sometimes ive seen it change three times in one day this is bs
5415295 it costs about 63 to fill my pacifica that is why i am thinking about traveling to visit my kids by amtrak which would cost me 40 bucks roundtrip i am hoping that amtrak will set up more train stations along their routes
5415296 its now 3 80 at my corner station here in georgia
5415297 i am so sick of this oil price boondoggle there is absolutely no justification for the current price of oil if our government doesnt get off it dead arse and do something about it our whole way of life is in jeopardy
5415298 not to mention that heroin will give you a buzz thats just plain nicer than mainlining gasoline

5415304 although foreign military financing is often justified to congress as playing a critical role in the war on terrorism in reality the weapons systems are often prestige items to help pakistan in the event of war with india

5415308 the frontier corps is under strain because its members are all pushtun and there are extreme pressures placed upon them in regard to combating fellow muslim tribesmen
5415309 three predators are said to be deployed at a and can be launched without specific permission from the islamabad government
5415310 in the past it required getting approval from the highest levels
5415311 congress should encourage the cia and other agencies in the i ntelligence c ommunity to take more active and aggressive measures to gather intelligence and act against al qaeda and taliban militias in pakistans tribal regions
5415312 inadequately trained and equipped and has been ill prepared for counter insurgency operations in fata
5415313 a great partner so far in the war on terror
5415314 pakistan and the united states remain steadfast allies and pakistans military is fighting bravely against terrorism
5415315 however its not irreconcilable differences in my view this is something that can be resolved bearing in mind the talks should come directly from the u s to pakistan not publicly and not by afghanistan

5415339 as an army officer and dot com pioneer were excited to show people a unique blend of both leadership styles to help them in life and their current job
5415340 above all were going to have fun so stay tuned
5415341 as we explore our total life fitness then weigh in with your own thoughts over at lauras
5415342 we live in such a wonderful country with so many reasons to take pride in our homeland what makes you proud to be an american
5415343 as i have driven many a mile through america through big cities and flyover country i have seen small towns having strawberry festivals crawfish festivals swamp buggy races local stock car races little league baseball games high school football games and city council meetings i feel so blessed to have been born in such a great country
5415344 im proud that i didnt vote for the con in the white house and have spoken out against him and his pals who have screwed my country and i dont refer to my country as my homeland too hitlerish for me its the nation of my birth
5415345 patriotism is measured in many ways wearing lapel pins saluting the flag and grandstanding are not among the ways we show pride in our nation when we work with the poor of this nation to lift them up from poverty we show pride when we teach the young of this nation we show pride
5415346 my diesel truck loves you and so does my tractor
5415347 the united states economy has been named the worlds number one for the 15th year in a row that makes me proud of my country
5415348 given his age and the nature of the treatment i would think this is the end of his political career good luck to him
5415349 may god bless him he is a great american and i wish him and his family well
5415350 i am just glad to get him out of office because of his voting for abortions time and time again i said one prayer for his salvation in all of this but other than that i hope the lord keeps him from going back to his job as a u s senator
5415351 blasphemy you are commanded by your savior to love if this is an example of how you think christians should speak or write you do not know what a christian is
5415352 let me enlighten you as to the he definition of a christian fundamentalist it refers to one who believes in the infallibility and inerrancy of the bible
5415353 i probably disagreed with his policies as much as you do kennedys it was still an emotional week ridicule these people as we may for their politics they are still giants of american history they did what they felt was right and fought hard for what they believed in
5415354 not for the first time a clutch of stories about george w
5415355 the whole gist of the article was to show that regardless of everyone trying to vilify the president the facts were different and that these doubters would one day regret doing so
5415356 dont worry ag investors business daily will be sucking eggs along with you and the author of this article too in that respect at least youre not alone
5415357 not afraid to make the unpopular decisions a mans man history will judge him well thanks for your service w
5415358 when bush was first elected or whatever you want to call that debacle in 2000 i thought oh well hes a bit of an embarrassment and he has no class but how much harm can he do in four years well it has gone way beyond my imagination
5415359 awesome go biden i never thought he should be president but hed make someone a heck of a secretary of call it like he sees it
5415360 obama is an appeaser and that is why he was so sure president bush had singled him out do the democrats really think americans believe a word that old arab sympathizer utters
5415361 chamberlain is a tiger compared to bush who let 9 11 happen on his watch despite the dire warnings and then let obl go from tora bora and still cannot be bothered to go after the terrorist behind 9 11 uss cole and more
5415362 this world was made for men and women to get married and not people of the same sex getting married
5415363 people that are against same sex marriage are not christians theyre just self centered jerks why isnt there an outrage against adultery that has ruined the meaning of marriage more than all the homosexual weddings could ever do
5415364 i look forward to the day when marriage rights will be extended to gays in all states to deny someone a basic human right based on their sexual orientation is not only immoral but it is utterly inconsistent with the notions of equality intrinsic in the u s legal system
5415365 the freedom to marry is assumed the government licenses marriage to ensure no harm is done by the union e g the marriage of close blood relatives
5415366 i would think that even the gays who would normally be happy about a victory such as this would be outraged at how the decision came about do we really want judges who legislate from the bench making our decisions for us
5415367 the courts have properly struck down many laws including those which mandated racial segregation and denied equal rights to women what we have here is simply an extension of that very valid principle to a group of citizens who do not enjoy widespread public support but they are still citizens
5415368 california was pushing beta when the rest of the country had vhs now this
5415369 both sides have the right to free speech barring either side is a direct violation of their first amendment rights in this case you only need to bar the opposition to the war to turn the parade into a political speech in favor of it
5415370 im with the guys that want to shut down the iraq debacle but i dont want them detracting from the time spent to honor those fallen in wwi or wwii or korea or vietnam or even those kia in iraq or afghanistan i dont really think its appropriate
5415371 ill show you how i didnt know chamberlain ceded part of czechoslovakia to hitler i probably heard it before and it was probably in there somewhere but its current cranial location may be occupied by the roster of the 95 indians or something
5415372 i make the rules do what i want you to have done or pay the consequences
5415373 with less than three months to go before the election a lot of people are still trying to square sen obamas varying positions on the surge in iraq first he opposed the surge and confidently predicted that it would fail then he tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge
5415374 not content to merely predict failure in iraq my opponent tried to legislate failure
5415375 it is hard to understand how sen mccain can at once proclaim his support for the sovereign government of iraq and then stubbornly defy their expressed support for a timeline to remove our combat brigades from their country
5415376 john mccain is intent on spending 10 billion a month on an open ended war while barack obama thinks we should bring this war to a responsible end and invest in our pressing needs here at home
5415377 the lasting advantage of a peaceful and democratic ally in the heart of the middle east could still be squandered by hasty withdrawal and arbitrary timelines and this is one of many problems in the shifting positions of my opponent sen obama
5415378 even in retrospect he would choose the path of retreat and failure for america over the path of success and victory
5415379 in short both candidates in this election pledge to end this war and bring our troops home
5415380 the great difference is that i intend to win it first
5415381 sometimes its difficult to know what a politician will actually do once in office because they say different things at different times to different people
5415382 this is a particular problem when a candidate has a short thin record on the issue as is the case of sen obama
5415383 part of his argument is that software creators have something to learn from the ideals of the arts and crafts movement the software world is full of soulless bits and bytes and maybe we would all be a little happier if we embraced handcraft during the talk i remember bernstein proposed that software creators should sign their work as a painter signs a painting which is a lovely visual metaphor that i hope to keep around
5415384 the governments out here take it very seriously and in my opinion seem to be doing a very good job individually and working together to deal with that terrorist threat
5415385 c rackdowns by various governments in the region are believed to have severely weakened the organization

5415390 wouldnt it be great if you get a chance to name somebody like roberts and alito
5415391 a vibrant participatory democracy should strengthen our representative democracy the third sector through charities voluntary organisations and social enterprises has much to offer from its traditions of purposeful altruism and selfless volunteering
5415392 we particularly value the role of the third sector in social and democratic renewal by which we mean groups campaigns co operatives mutuals and social enterprises owned and run by their own members investing their profits in the local community these types of organisations are where people learn the skills of democracy and where democracy can flourish
5415393 within the third sector we recognise and celebrate the role of individual active citizens social entrepreneurs campaigners volunteers and political activists our civil society is defined and energised by hundreds of thousands of decent people performing acts of altruism and selflessness and these people deserve the support and recognition of government
5415394 beckham is that player loaded with tools that everyone wants to see at the top of the draft class hes got all the athleticism and speed you could want and a real feel for the game
5415395 hes going to hit everyone knows he was hurt and the statistics dont look like they should but he just hits when hes right theres no one in the class the matches him in that department
5415396 the move behind the plate went smoothly and we know what a hot commodity a catcher who can swing the bat is posey may not be a slugger but he can swing the bat and stick behind the plate
5415397 he really the total package matusz is everything you could want when you are drafting a college pitcher the command the live stuff the polish its all there
5415398 after alvarez smoak is the next guy hes got a lot of competition with all the big bats this year but he can swing it from both sides and will hit for big power at the next level you have an idea of what youre getting with him
5415399 hes not your typical high school hitter hes not all about the big raw power or what he shows in the batting cage the kid can just hit his approach is not anything like a high school players usually is
5415400 theres not many arms out there like aaron crow hes got power stuff and has been very durable this spring he hit a rough patch and his stuff didnt look as lively but he looks like hes back in top form
5415401 skipworth has some work to do behind the plate but hes got the skills to stay back there his ticket is his bat though hes got huge upside at the plate
5415402 there have been some concerns with his command definitely but it is very hard to ignore the power stuff and the two plus pitches he has frontline potential
5415403 say what you want about his body are his defense or that he will have to play first base what no one can say is this guy cant hit hes close to a sure thing at the plate

5415407 thats the argument of flexibility and it goes something like this the constitution is over 200 years old and societies change it has to change with society like a living organism or it will become brittle and break
5415408 but you would have to be an idiot to believe that
5415409 the constitution is not a living organism it is a legal document
5415410 the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it

5415415 they re just very busy people and having a board meeting once a month or once every 2 weeks isn t gonna help us as much
5415416 experience contacts and business knowledge is great but only if you have time to give it
5415417 so the fact that the deal was killed by the dragons isn t necessarily negative for us
5415418 wow i think that is your youth and inexperience showing in business a 5000 00 deal can take months never mind 200 000 00 deal take time i am sure you ll learn this your mentor should have prepared you better you decided to give up 50 of the company to get what you needed it upsets me to read people discrediting the dragons because they wanted to make money
5415419 good judgment comes from experience experience comes from bad judgment
5415420 what if we would have been able to do this
5415421 all those who support us you know who you are
5415422 so what did we do the day after that boardroom meeting business as usual

5415466 stronger border controls are delivering falls in asylum claims theyre now at the lowest level for 14 years and we are dealing with those cases faster than ever before
5415467 overall todays figures prove that last year we deported someone every eight minutes and we got our priorities straight
5415468 that helped us boost removals of non asylum seekers to almost 50 000 thats nine per cent up on the year before on top of this we are dealing with cases faster than ever before more than 40 per cent of asylum claims are dealt with from beginning to end in under six months
5415469 we beat the prime ministers target and the rate at which foreign national prisoners are being deported has almost doubled
5415470 it is too soon to evaluate the full impact of the accession of bulgaria and romania to the eu which is why we decided to maintain restrictions for at least another year
5415471 we will continue to monitor restrictions thats why we are creating an independent migration advisory committee to look at how migration can sensibly fill skills shortages and alongside it the migration impacts forum which started work in june to monitor the wider social impacts of immigration
5415472 im so happy and so fortunate to have met a wonderful man
5415473 im just very lucky we got married a couple of weeks ago we did it quietly just the two of us
5415474 ive always respected what he does for the planet and what his company does to give back love his herbs
5415475 we raised a couple of million dollars for awareness it was an unbelievable experience
5415476 it was the unknown it was sometimes scary it was difficult it was strenuous it was challenging but when you got through it it was an amazing feeling of accomplishment ive never done anything like it before in my life to be in another country where you dont speak the language and to do something challenging
5415477 you cant look up and you cant look down so youre totally in the now which is where we want to be
5415478 sixteen years ago when i was first diagnosed i ran into a woman in a ladies room in australia

5415480 martin is forcing a solution in search of a problem
5415481 by all appearances the companys policies were motivated by nothing more than making sure a tiny percentage of bandwidth hogs didnt slow down internet traffic for everyone else on the network
5415482 earlier this year the cable company reached an agreement with bittorrent the popular file sharing service being used on comcasts network and settled the matter
5415483 the chairman is taking a huge step toward putting in place a regulatory regime that would give the fcc unprecedented control over how consumers use the web
5415484 its also not clear that the fcc even has the authority to enforce net neutrality because congress has never passed a law establishing such a policy
5415485 if comcast customers dont like the companys network management policies theyre free to take their business to verizon or at amp t or some other internet service provider
5415486 for red light runners yes because of the safety implications but for speeders no not for 10 miles over
5415487 i am a fast driver and i think it will improve highway safety
5415488 this is just another way for the government to get their hands in our pockets which i wouldnt mind so much if the politicians didnt squander the money so badly
5415489 if you get cited you do not have the chance to face your accuser you have the right to not self incriminate there is no arresting officer no change to explain your circumstance is the camera working properly

5415656 its alarming to learn that this far into the process key federal leadership roles in a pandemic have not been adequately defined much less tested through rigorous exercises and drills
5415657 it is vital to resolve questions of turf responsibility and performance in advance rather than in the heat of an actual pandemic but the gao observed that the only pandemic exercise involving cabinet members conducted to date took place nearly two years ago in 2005
5415658 in a post katrina world we cannot afford to be unprepared
5415659 experts say it is only a matter of time until the world experiences the next flu pandemic hurricane katrina taught us that key officials often didnt understand their roles and responsibilities which hindered efforts to get help where it was needed most i wholeheartedly support gaos recommendation that hhs and dhs develop testing training and exercises for pandemic flu to ensure federal leadership roles and responsibilities are understood and clearly defined
5415660 as this gao report indicates the national strategy for pandemic influenza falls short of being an effective strategy
5415661 the strategy needs to keep ahead of the threat and evolve before the pandemic hits we still have the chance to clarify the strategy and better identify the goals and objectives for everyone not just the federal government this will make the difference between some parts of the government being prepared and the entire nation being ready
5415662 an outbreak of pandemic influenza could have severe and long lasting consequences on our nation while the federal government has taken steps to improve our preparedness there is still work to be done
5415663 this report reiterates the need for increased coordination between our public health and homeland security officials to ensure that their roles are well defined and that they are ready and able to deal with a public health emergency i continue to support increased and effective collaboration between hhs and dhs to ensure our nation is prepared to deal with such an event

5415750 we have learned that caregiver strain is related to system performance
5415751 barriers to care and poor service coordination have been found to be associated with caregiver strain
5415752 if you compare two children with similar levels of clinical need the one whose parent is experiencing great caregiver strain is more likely to be treated in an expensive residential setting
5415753 it would appear that by reducing caregiver strain mental health systems could reduce costs of care
5415754 as our health care systems seek to reduce hospital and residential care and provide more community based services attention to caregiver strain will be critical
5415755 one has to know that these statistics do not necessarily mean how important the terms are since some very frequent term could only be translated in a librarys po file and thus reused by the software in numerous applications
5415756 the signature activity of our evaluation will be analyses of performance based incentive programs at approximately 1 200 texas schools and their impact on student achievement teacher turnover mobility and quality teacher behavior and institutional and organizational dynamics
5415757 the incentive program allows us to recognize and reward thousands of outstanding teachers we are hopeful that it will help texas school districts attract and retain highly skilled effective teachers
5415758 the vanderbilt led evaluation will allow us to gauge the impact of the program
5415759 neither of the incentive award programs is based solely on student performance on state tests
5415760 teaching excellence also takes into account such factors as mentoring of other teachers teaching in subject areas that face a shortage of teachers an individuals level of education and experience and whether the teachers are working in schools that are considered difficult to staff
5415761 our evaluations will focus on who receives the awards as well as how those awards affect the recipients and the schools
5415762 we are also interested in understanding whether differences exist between schools that receive the grants every year and schools that only receive the grants once or twice
5415763 challenging times will require us to meet the demands of declining revenues

5415770 i believe so strongly in an open internet for everyone
5415771 thats why as vice chairman of the subcommittee on telecommunications and the internet in the house energy and commerce committee ive been working to develop federal policies that keep the internet open

5415922 as a researcher one thing that you want to know is that your research is making a difference out in schools i hear weekly from teachers and kids about how their lives have changed because of read 180

5415925 i felt in the past that my research really influenced what i was doing in the classroom

5415931 but at the end of the day he was having a wonderful time making this movie i say he couldnt have been happier doing it
5415932 everybody else the mob what are they looking for theyre looking for money you can buy them
5415933 when you come across someone like the joker he is in it purely for the chaos he wants to highlight the hypocrisy of society how much they emulate heroes but when theyre inconvenienced when they have to step up to the plate and be a hero rarely do they ever actually manage to do that or have the guts to do that

5416190 we are committed to doing all we can to help tackle this hidden violence which takes place behind closed doors that is why i am today pleased to announce funding totalling 450 000 towards a new domestic violence enforcement campaign
5416191 working in partnership with police charities and communities i hope we see an increase in people coming forward more support for victims and a rise in the number of offenders being brought to justice
5416192 we are pleased to receive this additional funding to support our continuing fight against domestic abuse
5416193 we also want to continue to send the message out to perpetrators that if you commit domestic abuse you will be arrested
5416194 todays announcement is very encouraging as it demonstrates the governments commitment to tackling domestic violence better protection for women and children experiencing domestic violence is vital but it is needed all year round not just at christmas women and children need the best possible protection no matter what day it is
5416195 if people know about other cultures then theyll learn to appreciate and value the people tribal and religious conflicts would dissipate

5416245 tags are simply free form keywords people can use to describe their posts a tag is used to classify an item and make it discoverable in multiple ways
5416246 various basic concepts into which all knowledge can be classified
5416247 folksonomy also known as collaborative tagging social classification social indexing and social tagging is the practice and method of collaboratively creating and managing tags to annotate and categorize content in contrast to traditional subject indexing metadata is not only generated by experts but also by creators and consumers of the content usually freely chosen keywords are used instead of a controlled vocabulary
5416248 i know it is almost impossible to imagine the archive without our carefully planned categories but then i think tags might work better for other types of posts sites i do hope we end up with a combination of the two

5416287 the iranian bourse will likely not come into existence as the us military will step in before march 2006
5416288 as the date draws closer to march 2006 we should expect the iranian oil bourse conspiracy to grow even louder
5416289 there was abundance in the colonies and peace reigned on every border it was difficult even impossible to find a happier and more prosperous nation on all the surface of the globe comfort prevailed in every home the people in general kept the highest moral standards and education was widely spread
5416290 we have no poorhouses in the colonies and if we had some there would be no one to put in them since in the colonies there is not a single unemployed person not a beggar nor a tramp
5416291 in this manner by creating ourselves our own paper money we control its purchasing power and we have no interest to pay to anyone you see a legitimate government can both spend and lend money into circulation while banks can only lend significant amounts of their promissory bank notes for they can neither give away nor spend but a tiny fraction of the money the people need thus when your bankers here in england place money in circulation there is always a debt principal to be returned and usury to be paid the result is that you have always too little credit in circulation to give the workers full employment you do not have too many workers you have too little money in circulation and that which circulates all bears the endless burden of unpayable debt and usury
5416292 the colonies would gladly have borne the little tax on tea and other matters had it not been for the poverty created by the bad influence of the english bankers on the parliament which has caused in the colonies hatred of england and the revolutionary war
5416293 it was the monetary system under which americas colonies flourished to such an extent that edmund burke was able to write about them nothing in the history of the world resembles their progress
5416294 in a bad hour the british parliament took away from america its own scrip money forbade any further issue of such bills of credit these bills ceasing to be legal tender and ordered that all taxes should be paid in british coins consider now the consequences this restriction of the medium of exchange paralyzed all the industrial energies of the people ruin took place in these once flourishing colonies most rigorous distress visited every family and every business discontent became desperation and reached a point to use the words of dr johnson when human nature rises up and asserts its rights
5416295 after franklin gave explanations on the true cause of the prosperity of the colonies the parliament enacted laws forbidding the use of this money in the payment of taxes this decree clearly in the interest of the british bankers who stood behind the crown brought so many drawbacks and so much poverty to the people that it was the main cause of the revolution the supression of the colonial money was a much more important reason for the general uprising than the tea and stamp acts
5416296 when a well packaged web of lies has been sold gradually to the masses over generations the truth will seem utterly preposterous and its speaker a raving lunatic

5416429 of course most of the saber rattling is over irans nuclear program and the word
5416430 crazy scenarios involving irans purported attempts to create an oil bourse to start selling oil in euros make the rounds regularly and even get recommended with alacrity on dkos these things will not happen and we have as a supposedly reality based community to focus on real issues and not imaginary ones so let me explain why an iranian oil bourse will not work for the foreseeable future i hope that this diary can be used as a handy reference when this crops up again in the future so say that iran decides to sell its oil in euros fine both the iranians and their clients will determine the price for the transaction in dollars on one of the established markets and will trade these dollars for euros for the actual payment operation it will give banks active on the forex markets a little bit of income but will change nothing to how oil is traded so please lets stop the fantaisies or the conspiracy theories about a switch to euros or a new bourse if any transaction whether by saddam the iranians or anyone else is expressed in euros it is purely cosmetic the underlying market is in dollars and will remain that way we are badly undermining the credibility of the site by recommending silly scaremongering stories on that topic
5416431 in his annual state of the nation address to both houses of parliament on 10 may 2006 novosti reports president putin said that work on making the rouble an internationally convertible currency would be completed by 1 july 2006 six months ahead of schedule
5416432 they are indeed worrying figures a result of the no campaigns propaganda which has undoubtedly had some effect on peoples perception of the treaty on the other hand these results give us the drive to fight back we have all the winning arguments its a case of reaching out to people and making them aware of the wider benefits of this treaty reform
5416433 we welcome the ifas decision to unanimously back the lisbon treaty and to promote a yes among its members and their families the irish agricultural sector has benefited greatly from the eu since the beginning of irish eu membership it is therefore positive that the ifa executive has chosen to continue to embrace the eu through recommending a yes to the lisbon treaty

5416437 no matter how sophisticated you may be a large granite mountain cannot be denied it speaks in silence to the very core of your being
5416438 reading about nature is fine but if a person walks in the woods and listens carefully he can learn more than what is in books for they speak with the voice of god

5416695 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5416696 diet rich in fruit vegetables whole grains lean protein and a moderate or low percentage of fat
5416697 the good that atkins did is that he made people more mindful about the importance of limiting refined carbohydrates like sugar and white flour
5416698 the bad is that he taught people that in the short run you can sell a lot of books and make a lot of money telling them what they want to hear
5416699 taught the scientific community a good lesson to not be so quick to judge new approaches we cant test every fad diet so why did we test this one because 10 million people had bought the book
5416700 who would have predicted that certainly it wouldnt have been me
5416701 limiting fruit vegetables whole grains fiber and such popular dairy products as milk yogurt and cheese
5416702 whether anyone will care about the results i dont know but were going to continue
5416703 its clear that the atkins diet does better in the short term and doesnt do any worse in the long run in terms of weight control
5416704 that was so contrary to the general nutritional dogma that it really did shake things up a bit

5416706 were going to find out a little about their needs for next year and take the time to build the relationship a little
5416707 certainly theres value in building the relationship can you describe for me how we are going to do that on this call
5416708 i thought we would spend some time talking about his family and invite him to play some golf with us
5416709 well its a start i mean in order to build a relationship we are going to have to spend quite a bit of time with him and get to know him
5416710 what if we spend all this time building a relationship with him and it turns out he doesnt like either one of us what if he likes us but doesnt really want to do business with us in what way can we be assured that building a relationship with this guy is going to make a difference to our company
5416711 while its not always possible to do business right away it often is
5416712 hey you remeber hearing about that show where joco broke two strings in a row i was there
5416713 hyper v is always going to be a part of windows server releases going forward and will be constantly improving so vmware still has an uphill battle going forward
5416714 time will tell if they will release the code but i dont see it coming for two or three years
5416715 as long as vmware is making money selling its hypervisor as closed source it will probably stay that way
5416716 at this stage vmware has more to lose than gain by open sourcing its hypervisor
5416717 i dont see how opening its source code would benefit vmware
5416718 until microsoft and xen folks are in a more competitive position vis vis vmware the concept of commoditized virtualization is a pipe dream
5416719 the best judge of the better hypervisor is the linux community

5416839 microsofts hyper v is new and will take time to mature they dont have a suite of software anywhere akin to what vmware has the key when it comes to competing with microsoft is to innovate invest and keep increasing the customer value proposition which we intend to do

5416843 google is receiving so many searches per second and gathering incremental information from new auction bids and new advertisements that the search engine gets more relevant and powerful
5416844 how will they explain to their investors that they needed 33 million to build a search engine that cant even find itself
5416845 but one of the biggest advantages of google has over its competitors is that it can provide better search results because it has its massive advertising platform supporting it

5417115 why is mia still in school why hasnt she settled down with that nice boy shes the oldest of the grand kids and nothing from her yet when is she going to have a baby

5417118 so youre 4ft 11 but how big are your breasts
5417119 thank you for reminding me how small my breasts are
5417120 no no im not looking i didnt look im just saying
5417121 i dated a girl who was 4 ft 11 and she had double fs
5417122 i had a friend like that in high school laurie same height as me and she was like triple something halfway down the alphabet
5417123 oh my gawd this stinks honey smelll this is this rancid
5417124 i think this has gone bad taste it smell the funk off of it
5417125 would i care about this why do i care about any of what you have to say this has no relevance in my life
5417126 myfamily com 2 0 we talked about why we were doing this and outlined our goals and while we have been building 2 0 we have learned some very important things from you about the value of 1 0 and why we should not shut it down
5417127 no matter how great this new thing may be or may become my members have spent years on 1 0 and they know how to use it learning a new system is just something they and i dont want to have to go through again
5417128 2 0 lacks the feature or features we need or isnt user friendly enough that i want to make a switch
5417129 mistakes are a fact of life it is the response to error that counts
5417130 over the next few weeks well be updating the information in our migration help center with complete details on what these new changes mean for your situation well also send you a new email with the details when theyre ready
5417131 do we now need to move all posts from 2 0 to 1 0 if we want to use only 1 0
5417132 focus even more energy on the next generation myfamily com
5417133 a old techno phobe on dial up can use it
5417134 these people think they are doing something good for the company by acting childish and now the company
5417135 throughout my life i have encountered a lot of ignorance some of it by groups but mainly by individuals
5417136 ignorance is not reading the text of what someone says but instead lash out at them just because their name is attached to it it doesnt matter if you have explained something so many times that a first grader could understand they still dont get it because they dont read what is written maybe it is a comprehension problem in some instances i fear it is a combination of both
5417137 we are happy to announce that as of today we will continue support for myfamily com 1 0 and have no plans to require migration of 1 0 sites to 2 0 i also talked to mf people yesterday before renewing my 1 0 site to make sure that the 1 0 is not temporary as that is what some are relating in this blog
5417138 they decided to extend the life of the 1 0 until the 2 0 was really ready and up to their usual high standards before making migration mandatory i find that a very smart move on their part
5417139 we are happy to announce that as of today we will continue support for myfamily com 1 0 and have no plans to require migration of 1 0 sites to 2 0

5417141 it just sort of made sense since all three organizations were involved with each other anyway that we turn that involvement into something really positive and fun for our members
5417142 since theyve won a couple games were really excited about the positive momentum for the team
5417143 last year we did it just to offer something new for the ladies in our organization and we had such an overwhelming response that we knew immediately we were onto something

5417156 this innovative capacity building partnership with the maasai community of laikipia addresses a pressing yet legally and practically complex question how can indigenous and local communities record and promote their traditional cultural expressions without ceding authority over how the recordings are used by third parties
5417157 our goal is to empower tradition bearers to preserve and pass on their own traditional cultures if they wish to do so while safeguarding their intellectual property rights and interests testing these ideas through this community led pilot program is a big step toward that goal
5417158 dropping in unexpectedly at the homes of some iraq war veterans and seeing firsthand the often difficult and painful challenges the young vets face after returning home
5417159 there are hundreds of veterans out there who are falling through the cracks they make the ultimate sacrifices for us by laying down their lives but it seems like a lot of them just get forgotten about
5417160 i know my music inspires and helps a lot of people but you can always do more i teamed up with mtv and took the opportunity to share the spotlight with these veterans and hear their stories i went to their homes to listen and get their firsthand experiences i wanted to hear their stories
5417161 the stories of the veterans from the wars in iraq and afghanistan are important and worth telling
5417162 in conversations with veterans over the last year it became clear that kanyes music is used by soldiers in iraq as a way of connecting to home once these veterans return home their stories are so moving that you cant help but want to do the right thing and help them out

5417164 we found very minor differences in overall intelligence but if you look at the ability of someone to perform well in a timed situation females have a big advantage
5417165 it is very important for teachers to understand this difference in males and females when it comes to assigning work and structuring tests to truly understand a persons overall ability it is important to also look at performance in un timed situations for males this means presenting them with material that is challenging and interesting but is presented in smaller chunks without strict time limits
5417166 consider that many classroom activities including testing are directly or indirectly related to processing speed
5417167 the higher performance in females may contribute to a classroom culture that favors females not because of teacher bias but because of inherent differences in sex processing speed
5417168 processing speed doesnt refer to reaction time or the ability to play video games
5417169 its the ability to effectively efficiently and accurately complete work that is of moderate difficulty though males and females showed similar processing speed in kindergarten and preschool females became much more efficient than males in elementary middle and high school

5417172 the peabody college mentoring program seemed to me to be a natural extension of this work
5417173 for many mentees a caring and consistent adult presence can make a positive difference in their outlook and aspirations
5417174 is giving students an opportunity to find out for themselves how to live an effective adult life for some this is their first experience with disenfranchised people they learn that if these kids are behind there are a number of factors that have come together to cause that to happen many of them will someday find themselves in positions where they hold the purse strings make decisions or influence others i hope this is knowledge they will pass along
5417175 testing and accountability are good things but there is a price to pay and i worry that it may be paid in time spent on building positive relationships mentoring addresses this problem

5417189 it would be great if we could have a garden shed
5417190 the world began without the human race and it will end without it
5417191 simply put many computer scientists doubt that paperless dres can be made reliable and secure and they expect that any failures of such systems would likely go undetected
5417192 to carry out these attacks the attacker must somehow install his malicious software on one or more voting machines
5417193 the second method is to exploit a back door feature in diebolds code to manually install the attack files from a memory card
5417194 the third method exploits a service feature of the machines bootloader
5417195 the first method requires the attacker to remove several screws and lift off the top of the machine to get access to the motherboard and eprom
5417196 a poll worker election official technician or other person who had private access to a machine for as little as one minute could use these methods without detection
5417197 rather than injecting code into each machine directly an attacker could create a computer virus that would spread from one voting machine to another
5417198 when the machine is rebooted it normally emits a musical chime that might be noticed during a stealth attack but this sound can be suppressed by plugging headphones or just a headphone connector into the machines headphone jack
5417199 to prove that this is possible we constructed a demonstration virus that spreads itself automatically from machine to machine installing our demonstration vote stealing software on each infected system
5417200 diebold delivers software upgrades to the machines via memory cards a technician inserts a memory card containing the updated code and then reboots the machine causing the bootloader to install the new code from the memory card
5417201 memory cards are also transferred between machines in the process of transmitting election definition files to voting machines before an election
5417202 if one of the few units that download the data is infected it will transfer the infection via the stacks of memory cards into many voting machines

5417326 i dont think im going to get any argument from users
5417327 i was not a big fan of the original iphone
5417328 but i think they addressed many of my concerns with the 3g iphone
5417329 the fact that a user or even a company cant replace the battery without having to send it in to apple how is that going to work if employees dont have their phones for a week
5417330 im hearing a lot of it managers telling me that their corporate executives are telling them that they want corporate support of the iphone
5417331 when i talk to people the response i get from most it managers and this is very anecdotal is that theyre definitely looking at it
5417332 its a beautiful piece of engineering that will allow them to work better while living on the road
5417333 were an sap shop and it would be useful in many instances particularly for the salespeople to be able to get sap on the iphones
5417334 there are a lot of ways to skin that cat the least amount of effort would be to web enable our sap apps and having a big screen and a big browser with the iphone makes that a lot easier
5417335 but it still depends on what kind of enterprise youre in
5417336 finally the battery life on the apple 3g iphone is just awful
5417337 its not so much that the battery life is worse than the original but because i can pull email in the background and because i can do other applications im doing more with it than i was with the original that means my battery is dying on me on average in the late afternoon
5417338 i dont think im going to get any argument from users

5417351 barcelona is an open cosmopolitan city a brilliant urban space with a strong personality and an international reputation at the forefront of both economic transformation and cultural change barcelona is playing an active role in spains future and research studios will also be playing an active role in that change process opening this studio enables us to push the boundaries of communication with groundbreaking experimental projects and developing award winning visual languages design is my way to withstand uniformity and the commonplace more than a job it is an aesthetic phenomena a responsibility and a brilliant opportunity for creating new purposeful and amazing experiences
5417352 it makes sense that pablo as one of the most talented graphic artists and typographers currently working in the industry worldwide should be heading up research studios barcelona we have always sought out the very best design practitioners and allowed them to engage with interesting and challenging projects for a roster of diverse brands barcelona will run on the same principle shared by the research studios network open collaboration between offices and designers bringing their own personal background and their cultural surround to bear on projects to create groundbreaking design solutions

5417355 il petrolio e gli altri combustibili fossili sono in via di esaurimento ma anche luranio destinato a scarseggiare entro 35 40 anni non possiamo continuare perci a elaborare piani energetici sulla base di previsioni sbagliate che rischiano di portarci fuori strada dobbiamo sviluppare la pi importante fonte energetica che la natura mette da sempre a nostra disposizione senza limiti a costo zero e cio il sole che ogni giorno illumina e riscalda la terra
5417356 non esiste un nucleare sicuro o a bassa produzione di scorie esiste un calcolo delle probabilit per cui ogni cento anni un incidente nucleare possibile e questo evidentemente aumenta con il numero delle centrali
5417357 il carbone la fonte energetica pi inquinante pi pericolosa per la salute dellumanit ma non si risolve il problema nascondendo lanidride carbonica sotto terra in realt nessuno dice quanto tempo debba restare eppure la co2 dura in media fino a 30 mila anni contro i 22 mila del plutonio no il ritorno al carbone sarebbe drammatico disastroso
5417358 c un impianto per la produzione di energia solare costruito nel deserto del nevada su progetto spagnolo
5417359 i nuovi impianti solari termodinamici a concentrazione catturano lenergia e la trattengono in speciali contenitori fino a quando serve poi attraverso uno scambiatore di calore si produce il vapore che muove le turbine n pi n meno come una diga che negli impianti idroelettrici ferma lacqua e al momento opportuno la rilascia per alimentare la corrente

5417361 speaking at the euroscience open forum in barcelona arnulf jaeger waldau of the european commissions institute for energy said it would require the capture of just 0 3 of the light falling on the sahara and middle east deserts to meet all of europes energy needs the scientists are calling for the creation of a series of huge solar farms producing electricity either through photovoltaic cells or by concentrating the suns heat to boil water and drive turbines as part of a plan to share europes renewable energy resources across the continent a new supergrid transmitting electricity along high voltage direct current cables would allow countries such as the uk and denmark ultimately to export wind energy at times of surplus supply as well as import from other green sources such as geothermal power in iceland energy losses on dc lines are far lower than on the traditional ac ones which make transmission of energy over long distances uneconomic the grid proposal which has won political support from both nicholas sarkozy and gordon brown answers the perennial criticism that renewable power will never be economic because the weather is not sufficiently predictable its supporters argue that even if the wind is not blowing hard enough in the north sea it will be blowing somewhere else in europe or the sun will be shining on a solar farm somewhere scientists argue that harnessing the sahara would be particularly effective because the sunlight in this area is more intense solar photovoltaic pv panels in northern africa could generate up to three times the electricity compared with similar panels in northern europe
5417362 proprio nel momento in cui in italia si rialzato il polverone sul nucleare una possibile soluzione per lapprovvigionamento energetico italiano e non solo arriva dal deserto e in particolare dal sahara il principio di base che il futuro dellenergia non latomo ma il sole nel deserto del sahara lungo 4000 kilometri e largo quasi 2000 lirraggiamento solare molto forte e lescursione termica stagionale piuttosto ridotta se si riuscisse a recuperare una frazione dellenergia solare che illumina il deserto questa coprirebbe una parte del fabbisogno energetico di diversi paesi soprattutto quelli del mediterraneo il progetto presentato al parlamento europeo di bruxelles da un gruppo di ingegneri tedeschi si basa sulle pi avanzate tecnologie solari gli impianti termosolari come quelli prodotti dallenea ente per le nuove tecnologie lenergia e lambiente installati nel sahara produrrebbero annualmente con ogni kilometro quadrato di specchi parabolici energia elettrica pari a quella ricavata da circa 1 milione di barili di petrolio
5417363 secondo alcuni ricercatori pompando acqua nel sottosuolo dove intrappolato questo calore e poi facendo girare delle turbine con lacqua calda che ritorna in superficie ad altissima pressione potremmo generare energia elettrica per decenni o addirittura per secoli
5417364 siamo contrari allo sviluppo del nucleare di terza generazione e preferiamo che si guardi ad altri tipi di energia come quella eolica
5417365 sostenere che inutile avere unitalia denuclearizzata visto che in molti paesi vicini ci sono le centrali sbagliato e occorre tornare indietro
5417366 quanto conta il nucleare nella produzione energetica francese circa il 20 per cento
5417367 come ricorderete in italia la fiat si dichiara pronta a riconvertire le sue auto allenergia solare ma a due condizioni 1 la fiat dovr possedere il controllo azionario del sole e 2 la fiat potr fare ricorso alla cassa integrazione in caso di eclissi
5417368 il nucleare una scelta indispensabile se vogliamo rimanere al passo con leuropa
5417369 il mondo va in unaltra direzione nel 2007 le nuove installazioni di impianti eolici hanno superato in termini di potenza le nuove centrali nucleari il futuro nel sole e nel vento il nucleare sta diventando il passato

5417570 im not sure if its totally because were on a cable show or the right guy created the right show but i think we have a little more room to breathe on a cable show you dont have to come out of the gates bringing in x millions of viewers you actually get a chance to find your legs which never happens on a network the dynamic is a little easier going a little looser you can actually put your focus on the creative stuff rather than numbers

5417574 theres a ton of trust involved and i find myself week to week presented with a very unique opportunity of shaping the work that were doing as opposed to just making a script funny its really been a blessing and i have to say it really doesnt happen very often in television

5417578 we are pleased and gratified that the irrc stood tall against the special interests and with the 80 percent of pennsylvanians who support tough pennsylvania specific regulations against toxic mercury pollution
5417579 this issue is crucial to pennsylvania families since our states power plants are the second biggest emitters of toxic mercury pollution in the country
5417580 we urge the pennsylvania legislature to keep faith with their constituents and let this regulation become law
5417581 this rule has been thoroughly discussed in stakeholder groups public hearings and a period of public comment during the past two years
5417582 some in the legislature want to nullify the regulatory process and overturn the clear wishes of their constituents
5417583 that would be arrogance of the nth degree and is exactly what the voters rebelled against at the polls earlier this month we must not let the polluters succeed
5417584 we urge the legislature to abide by the irrc decision and let the mercury regulations become law
5417585 surely protecting babies from brain and neurological damage from toxic mercury is a cause worth fighting for

5417592 our findings indicate that young children who stutter are more apt to be emotionally aroused less able to settle down once aroused and less able to control their attention and emotion during everyday stressful or challenging situations
5417593 stuttering as it continues can impact a childs academic emotional social and vocational potential and development therefore if we know more about how emotions influence stuttering and then use this information to more effectively treat early childhood stuttering we should be in a better position to decrease the long term negative effects of stuttering in children as they get older
5417594 these new findings tell us that when parents tell clinicians for example that excitement increases their childs stuttering clinicians should try to see how and when certain emotional states increase or maintain the childs stuttering
5417595 our findings seem to indicate that kids with behavioral and emotional issues are at greater risk of stuttering that not all aspects of their emotional reactions can be blamed on stuttering and some of these reactions may pre date the onset of stuttering and actually contribute to its onset and development
5417596 yes shes my new girlfriend thats right she is my new girlfriend

5417598 hey officer mike in your professional opinion is that kid drunk or is it just me
5417599 you know i only told you those things back then because i was trying to look out for you you were always a pretty girl i could see it back then despite the weight i was just trying to motivate you
5417600 dont stress it papa you could never get a girl like me
5417601 beast get the fluck off the phone suck on your inhaler and move onto your next victim
5417602 ahhhh i see perhaps you would like 8x 10 glossies of them bumping ugly as well
5417603 look babe if that is youre attitude then whatever happens from here on whatever he crap he throws your way you deserve and dont have a right to complain
5417604 nah man its not that youre a fantastic person and dont deserve this crap but if youre not willing to make the change then why keep advertising the fact that hes a jerk youre only making yourself look stupid youre not even coming across as a victim youre coming across as a world class sucker you really should start seeing other people keep your options open because these days you seem to be spending more time with me than with him meanwhile hes whooping it up with the other chick
5417605 i just like to dance every now and then you know have a little fun
5417606 i dont get the pregame jitters or sit in my locker im walking around i dont like sitting down before the game im just out there doing what i love and having fun if im dancing and listening to music so be it
5417607 everybody in lawrence kansas says they want to know him and that they pal around with him and hes their buddy
5417608 hes been invited just about everywhere i think if he continues to do a good job managing going from being a player that was not well known who was competing for a position last year at this time to being someone thats highly respected as a player in our league thats the key
5417609 it hasnt been too bad living in lawrence its a small town you know people come up to you and its all been good stuff they say congratulations we really enjoyed the season so it hasnt been anything too bad
5417610 last year we were picked fifth in the north and i think we did a little bit better than that
5417611 thats how we want it to be we want to be overlooked because its a lot more fun playing when people dont want you to succeed
5417612 i cant control that i play whos on the schedule whoevers on the schedule were going to go out there and do our best
5417613 without that experience going into the spring i wouldnt have been able to beat out kerry meier or even get the opportunity to
5417614 im not really worried about what publicity im getting the only thing im worried about is getting ready for this season and playing the best i can the rest will fall as it will
5417615 you can always get better you can always improve your knowledge of the game improve your leadership theres always something you can improve on and your job as an athlete is to make yourself better each year
5417616 the one thing that allowed me to be successful last year was just playing within the system i didnt try to force too many things i tried to limit turnovers and mistakes and keep us in a position that if a play wasnt going to be good dont make it really bad
5417617 i think he needs to continue to work on getting his reads and getting rid of the ball quickly which is something i think he does very well i think that the mental part of the game hes very good at but i think there are some areas he can still brush up you know hes going to get a lot of looks from the defense this year theyre going to try and disguise their coverages a lot and their blitzes and they going to try and fool him so he needs to continue to be a good student of the game watching a lot of tape studying the opponent and studying himself

5417626 i wanted to try selling something i bought designer shoes from saks fifth avenue outlet because i had a coupon for 15 percent off i sold them at the regular outlet price
5417627 everybody thought i was crazy that i bought all these shoes and there was no guarantee of selling them but all the shoes were returnable within 30 days
5417628 i figured that if i didnt sell them i would take them back they all ended up selling within a week
5417629 thats what gave me the idea to start snappy auctions for people who didnt want to spend the time to learn how to use ebay and do it themselves

5417669 owais is going to bat at number three for the simple fact that i think he was wasted at number seven
5417670 hes a high scoring quick scoring cricket player who plays cricket shots to get boundaries and i think down the order he was wasted
5417671 when he has played for us hes always done really well he got a one day hundred against india last year and has got runs this year and i am going to give him the confidence to bat at number three with myself at number four
5417672 i havent thought about the twenty20 side yet but theres definitely a strong case for owais getting a good opportunity to bat and play long innings for england
5417673 it was definitely useful because we got a side out there to run around in the field and to see the options available to me certainly from the bowling front was great
5417674 it was good to have a side out with seven of the players getting a bowl and it showed we have a lot of strength and depth
5417675 its key now to identify players and roles in the team ive identified how i want to play and its a case of getting the confidence in the players to do what they need to do and thats what im prepared to do
5417676 i want to give the guys a good run at it and concentrate on a specific role so when something happens and you need to change at least ive identified the roles the players need to play and they can just slot in and slot out its not a case of doing one thing on one day and another thing on another day
5417677 the england game is as big as it gets its just a sad and disappointing end to what potentially could have been a semi decent game
5417678 as soon as the fixture came out there was a major buzz around the team
5417679 babies are just plain smarter than we are at least if being smart means being able to learn something new they think draw conclusions make predictions look for explanations and even do experiments in fact scientists are successful precisely because they emulate what children do naturally
5417680 one of the studies which tracked the health and exercise habits of more than 18 000 women over a period of about 12 years found that those who walked regularly had the mental acuity usually associated with people several years younger among the possible explanations dr weuve said was that the good overall cardiovascular health helped the brain she also pointed to research suggesting that physical activity encouraged the growth of brain cells and the connections between them

5417692 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5417693 when people find out that im on a low carb diet one comment i always hear is how its a great diet for losing weight but it doesnt give you enough energy to exercise or compete in a sport people are stunned when i inform them that my performance has actually increased as a result of reducing carbohydrates in my diet and ensuring i am consuming enough protein for those of you that think you cant perform at a high level athletically and remain on a low carb diet id like to share a few thoughts that i have on the subject as a former college wrestler who competed during the 1990s the idea of low fat and high carbohydrate dieting was ingrained in me from start to finish rice and black beans and pasta was the staple of my poorly planned in season diet of course the whole justification for this diet was based on a study of us distance runners conducted during the during the 1970s anyone who knows how competitive or uncompetitive us distance runners have been in international competition could see the flaw in studying them as the ideal in high performance nevertheless the fallacy that in order to be a high performing athlete you need to have a high intake of carbs is still entrenched in the conventional wisdom of the athletic community as low carb high protein diets have become more prevalent the number of resources for athletes that want to compete with a low carb training table has grown considerably probably the most popular are the paleo diet for athletes by dr loren cordain and the the zone diet by barry sears many athletic communities have embraced these meal plans not only for the reduction in body fat that many people experience but also for the increased athletic performance they seem to foster although these are very popular choices one is by no means limited to them i myself follow a plan similar to the one outlined in the book protein power by drs michael and mary eades and have heard of many athletes that have found optimal results from a diet that consists of a higher percentage of fat and lower percentage of carbs than advocated in the zone diet

5417778 weve played the game a lot and think its five star its got over 80 levels and the final one is really hard when you have to blow up fireballs that are coming at you
5417779 were all pleased with the game and hoping for a good response now its on sale at our website
5417780 we currently have two more games in various stages of production and hope to start creating more sophisticated 3d games that will put wales on the map in the computer games industry
5417781 the computer games industry is one of the biggest in the world yet there are very few companies in wales making games as a result many people like myself who are gaining degrees in computer game design are having to leave the country in order to find jobs
5417782 newports university has two excellent computer games development courses producing talented students with lots of potential it seems ludicrous that wales is losing them to other countries because we have no computer games industry
5417783 the release of this game represents a considerable success for adam and his team at dark rock
5417784 at newport we believe its essential to maintain close links with the computer games industry to enable our students to successfully find jobs when they graduate we already have graduates working for major games companies such as sega and blitz and this year sees the first woman graduate from the course
5417785 the university has now helped more than 65 graduates set up their own business
5417786 we have many enterprising students who posses a diverse range of talent and we help them by providing funding and the business skills necessary to become the entrepreneurs of tomorrow and ensure the future growth and prosperity of wales

5417815 illegal drug use is unacceptable it wastes lives destroys families and damages communities while drug use is at an 11 year low and drug related crime has fallen by a fifth in the last five years i am well aware we are dealing with a formidable social problem
5417816 we will continue to send a clear message that drug use is unacceptable that we are on the side of communities that we demand respect for the law and will not tolerate illegal or anti social behaviour but that we will provide help for those who are trying to turn their lives around to get off drugs and into work to ensure drug problems are not handed on to the next generation and that we expect drug users themselves to take responsibility and will help them to do so
5417817 over the past ten years we have substantially expanded drug treatment more people than ever are entering treatment they are waiting less time to get into programmes and staying in treatment for longer this new strategy builds on that success
5417818 every drug user is different this strategy will ensure that treatment is more personalised and tailored to suit individual needs a key element is an innovative new pilot scheme which will help drug users who are on benefits get into treatment get a job and live a drug free life
5417819 we know that a small minority of parents are themselves drug users that can put children at risk so we are announcing that parents with dependent children will get better and faster access to specialist drug treatment
5417820 at the heart of the new drugs strategy is recognising the influence of families in tackling the problem so we will help parents by providing more information and support to help them talk to their children about drugs
5417821 we are also launching our new parents partnership which brings together big name childrens charities and parents groups to help parents who dont know what to say to their children about drugs or what to do if they think their children might have a problem
5417822 we want to make sure drug users get the support they need to help them kick the habit and get back into work where they can support themselves and their families
5417823 todays strategy sets out the first steps in ensuring the benefits system gives people the access route off drugs while making sure taxpayers money is well spent
5417824 the last ten years have seen a significant coming together of the strands within the issue of tackling drugs we particularly welcome the enhanced emphasis in the new strategy on prevention through working with young people and families we recognise that it is the combination of effective enforcement drug treatment and prevention in a context of all agencies working both together and with communities that is important for a successful future

5417885 i really surprised to see the ceremony how u chinese people spent us 1 400 billion in only 1 day as the world is in worst food crises
5417886 a great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men
5417887 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
5417888 posted by a chinese august 9 08 01 14 am
5417889 a great man shows his greatness by the way he treats little men
5417890 how can we see something true when the chinese government does not support a free and open press to show us the true things
5417891 sure china will come up with a sparkling show that will divert everyone from the problems they are having
5417892 you guys develop too fast and you are using our resources
5417893 its a shame the chinese government is supporting the genocide in dar fur
5417894 how do you say in chinese b o r i n g
5417895 its amazing that these same people slaughtered 51 million of their own in the 1950s and rule over their own people now with a sledge hammer free tibet
5417896 there has been no progress towards fulfilling these promises only continued deterioration
5417897 the authorities have used the olympic games as pretext to continue and in some respects intensify existing policies and practices which have led to serious and widespread violations of human rights
5417898 china really needs to be releasing human rights activists in order to be showing its following through with its promises
5417899 sending a message that it is acceptable for a government to host the olympic games in an atmosphere characterized by repression and persecution
5417900 china is the last country on earth barring myanmar that deserved to be selected to host the olympics shame the ioc didnt wait until the chinese authorities learned to behave in a civilized fashion towards all of their people spectacular display however albeit the soulless regimentation comes over as a bit creepy i wonder how many walmart sweatshop workers got to see it
5417901 you have the right to keep yourself away from any made in china goods and i strongly encourage you to do so if you cant do that just shut your mouth up
5417902 you can do anything you set your mind to when you have vision determination and an endless supply of expendable labor
5417903 wow not a single latino white or black face in the ceremony is diversity a strength as so many pandering politicians parrot as often as possible or is it a neutral ask the chinese would the opening ceremony in beijing have been better if every single performer didnt look just like every other
5417904 even if the last picture is showing a typical family in china what i can see is the spirit in the childrens eyes their joy and pride after watching such an impressive ceremony hosted by their own country
5417905 hey kids cant you read this one is for colored thats for white only thats the one you should use
5417906 boykott og in nations like china its a dictatorship no real human rights
5417907 its a pleasure to welcome friends from far away we chinese ppl welcome all friends from all over the world to come visit china
5417908 let us love one another for love is god and every one that loveth is born of god and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love
5417909 there are friends come from faf place how pleasan it is
5417910 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
5417911 the ability to think say and do what we want
5417912 if you have never been to china please shut up your mouth although its true that our goverment still has a long way to go but people most entitled to critisize it are we chinese we suppot our government and we will monitor it as well as help it do better in future chinese people now is living better and better thats doubtless truth we scorn to quarrel whis those arrogant and ignorant people before commenting others i think youd better care about your own country first of all
5417913 100 years ago china was invaded by civilized countries because china is barbaric
5417914 you guys develop too fast and you are using our resources
5417915 when you point a finger at others your three other fingers are pointing right back at you
5417916 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
5417917 i wonder if theyre being ordered to do that by their government or theyre living elsewhere and just brainwashed by communist propaganda
5417918 why we tried so hard because you never listen and naver want to know about china never want to know what the chinese people are thinking about
5417919 and lets be honest most people probably need a helping hand when it comes to making decisions for themselves for example
5417920 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
5417921 oh yes unlike those chinese all of us americans are well taken care of and living in sparkling clean conditions
5417922 wow look at the last one they are such a great country to live they treat their people so well
5417923 oh yes unlike those chinese all of us americans are well taken care of and living in sparkling clean conditions
5417924 migration brings great social and economic benefits to this country but people expect it to be managed robustly and in support of
5417925 the points based system will build on a package of measures already being introduced to deliver a more secure border
5417926 i believe it is right that we protect those at risk and that is why i am proposing that the age at which a person can sponsor or be sponsored to come to the i also believe that it is right that they play by the rules that is why i want to strengthen our ability to block the privilege of citizenship to those with a criminal record after all british citizenship is a privilege not a right
5417927 a spoonful of russian podcast will be coming back i also wanted to share with you an interview i recently gave to a bbc reporter and producer april peavey it aired today january 4th 2006 it was a pleasure and honor to work with april

5418110 gaillard john t scopes is speaking at peabody get out there and do an interview
5418111 i did little more than sit proxy like in freedoms chair that hot unforgettable summer
5418112 no great feat despite the notoriety it has brought me
5418113 before i would tie a noose around the neck of a boy
5418114 i would try to call back into my mind the emotions of youth i would try to remember what the world looked like to me when i was a child i would try to remember how strong were these instinctive persistent emotions that moved my life i would try to remember how weak and inefficient was youth in the presence of the surging controlling feelings of the child
5418115 to teach any theory that denies the story of the divine creation of man as taught in the bible
5418116 because i fear we shall lose the consciousness of gods presence in our daily life if we must accept the theory that all through the ages no spiritual force has touched the life of man and shaped the destiny of nations
5418117 but there is another objection the darwinian theory represents man as reaching his present perfection by operation of the law of hate the merciless law by which the strong crowd out and kill off the weak
5418118 is a continuing one that has existed throughout mans brief history and will continue as long as man is here it is the cause of freedom for which each man must do what he can

5418173 i need to go buy more posters for the pep rally
5418174 tim my name is joe from golf digest how are you doing today
5418175 good the reason for the call is to make sure that you are receiving your golf digest and that you are happy with the magazine
5418176 thats great ill tell you what we are going to do we are going to upgrade your account to preferred and offer you our best rate of 1 88 per issue for renewing how does that sound
5418177 tim you just said no to a question that isnt really a yes no question was that no directed toward me or someone in the room with you
5418178 okay im a little confused you like the magazine i just offered you our very best rate to renew and you said no why would a person say no to renewing at our very best rate if they are happy with the magazine
5418179 simple really joe i ordered a one year subscription of the magazine and i have received two copies that means that i have ten months left before i need to renew i never renew subscriptions until the subscription is about to expire
5418180 i understand completely and it makes sense heres the deal though we will never be able to offer this rate again so by renewing early you will get the very best deal and you will be locking in the very best deal for as long as you want even though you have only been receiving the magazine for two months you have already experienced our award winning columnists stroke saving tips and interviews with the worlds best golfers and most influential golf course designers as an avid golfer i know you wouldnt want to give that up and as a smart business man you wouldnt want to pass up the savings being offered today would you prefer to extend your subscription for one two or three years

5418184 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5418185 for example the manufacturers suggested serving size of one of the low carb pastas was 50g whereas most other pasta manufacturers will say that a serving size is 100g so you eat less carbs because youre actually eating a smaller amount of food
5418186 they also replace the sugars and starches with ingredients that dont count as carbohydrates on the nutrition panel some use synthetic forms of dietary fiber but these forms of fiber dont offer the nutritional benefits of fruit nuts or whole grains that are all rich in carbohydrate
5418187 livin la vida low carb my journey from flabby fat to sensationally skinny in one year
5418188 some low carb products may have less carbohydrates per serving than their conventional counterparts but not necessarily so much less to make you lose weight
5418189 we have to work out whether its meaningful health wise to say whether a product is low carb or not
5418190 theres no evidence that low carb diets are safe beyond about 12 months they can put you at risk of heart disease and kidney problems not to mention increasing your chances of developing osteoporosis youre much better off trying to lose weight by exercising more and eating less and sticking to a diet with plenty of whole grains fruit and veggies with lean meat and low fat dairy products
5418191 the cuda center of excellence program rewards schools that truly embrace the concept of parallel processing as the future of computing
5418192 schools receiving this accreditation integrate the cuda software environment into their curriculum to help their students harness the capabilities of these new parallel processing architectures as one of the countrys leading schools in this field i am personally delighted to appoint uiuc as our first cuda center of excellence
5418193 i saw the dark knight i feel like im dumb because i feel like i dont get how many things that are so smart its like a ferrari engine of storytelling and scriptwriting and im like thats not my idea of what i want to see in a movie i loved the prestige but didnt understand the dark knight didnt get it still cant tell you what happened in the movie what happened to the character and in the end they need him to be a bad guy im like i get it this is so highbrow and so fucking smart i clearly need a college education to understand this movie you know what fuck dc comics thats all i have to say and thats where im really coming from
5418194 a democratization policy in the middle east without a different energy policy at home is a waste of time money and most important the lives of our young people
5418195 but already there are signs of trouble ahead in the last few years mr rumsfeld has tried to kill some weapons systems he saw as cold war anachronisms and to push a military modernization plan but his efforts were thwarted by what washington calls the iron triangle of congress the uniformed military command and military contractors
5418196 join me in good faith i will meet you with an open hand an open door and an open mind
5418197 an ever more nuclear ready iran will try to lead the revolutionary islamic vanguard throughout the islamic world by becoming the main support for terrorist organizations aimed against washingtons key regional ally israel americas key energy source saudi arabia and washingtons prospective democratic ally iraq
5418198 it could mark the final end of efforts to prevent nuclear proliferation and provide islamic terrorism with a nuclear deterrent

5418207 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5418208 i wonder how many pizza slices and cheeseburgers they let him eat on that diet i would venture to say zip zero nada
5418209 im only defending weight watchers because i wouldnt want people to accuse you of not understanding that diet the way all others trash low carb because they dont understand it weight watchers says you can eat anything you just have to account for it i had pizza and cheeseburgers many times during my weight loss couldnt eat much else all day but there you have it
5418210 stayed at her goal weight for about an hour or two
5418211 after that it was a steady climb back up the scales i wish i had discovered low carb right then as im sure it would have helped me maintain the loss i didnt gain it all back but enough to frustrate me into trying atkins
5418212 no more cravings no more digestive upsets no more dissatisfaction and im always in a great mood
5418213 i was pretty nervous about how it would be received i especially didnt want to come across as bashing weight watchers
5418214 but i soon came to my senses that they were telling me to continue doing what i was doing before so i started looking for alternatives
5418215 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5418216 there is no one size fits all approach whatever you do make it a lifestyle sugar and refined carbohydrates are bad for weight loss eat nutrient dense foods and finally low carb is a viable option and the best approach for some people
5418217 it turned out well and will help everyone understand where i am coming from i think i gave them a different perspective on low carb

5418279 nobody even knew this was under discussion its exactly the sort of process which will ensure that the scheme doesnt work policy announced from the top to a cynical population without even being properly thought out
5418280 looking for all intents and purposes like hes giving the people of trinidad and tobago a great big meggie

5418290 i like to think that the background music of my counseling is the verse by the german poet goethe he said theres nothing more frightening than the sight of ignorance in action
5418291 im totally ignorant of what its like to be married
5418292 my experience in the counseling room over the years ive been a priest for 51 years convinced me that i should distill from all the marriage counseling ive done a profile of the kind of person you should never marry
5418293 thats the lecture that i give to high school seniors
5418294 my argument is that once they fall in love its too late were so infatuated that our judgment fails judgment is trumped by infatuation
5418295 of course people can change but dont think you can change them
5418296 these men who are overly influenced by their mother for some reason or another are looking for another mother they want two mothers
5418297 they look for another mother in the person of their wife to be thats disastrous or can be disastrous
5418298 my mother was once asked how she managed to live harmoniously with three men my father brother and me her answer delivered with awesome arrogance was you simply operate on the assumption that no man matures after the age of 11 my father fell about laughing
5418299 that means he wont be able to live a life of loving intimacy with his wife because hes incapable of entering into an intimate relationship with anybody
5418300 the husband does what he can do as far as bringing in money goes she does what she can do as far as bringing in money goes they specialize in the areas in which they have expertise that allows them to make money and spend money wisely very often the husband and the wife are diametrically opposed in their attitude toward money
5418301 compromise on that the others are in a sense nonstarters
5418302 then they say gosh we wish wed listened to what you said
5418303 the pope could change that with the stroke of a pen
5418304 the first madonna but madonna is more like marie osmond when compared to betty davis

5418310 its a great program and you always notice something like a national championship and this summer they put a lot of guys in the nba

5418312 at some point the criminals now developing pc malware will start focusing on mobile devices
5418313 its not a question of if but when and how im keeping a close eye on the iphone it may be the tipping point that sets the mobile malware field afire
5418314 the third edition pretty much kills off malware because of code signing
5418315 the iphone runs a cut down computer os as mobile manufacturers bring out more of these sophisticated devices they may have vulnerabilities that would let malware be installed without requiring user interaction

5418323 trifling lawsuit against atkins dismissed judge says diet protected by the first amendment
5418324 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5418325 dear mr moore hello you dont know me but i feel i have a deep responsibility to mail you about my story
5418326 earlier this year i weighed close to 280 pounds i had high blood pressure border line diabetes high bad cholesterol and low good cholesterol i was hobbled by vicious gout attacks i was in no good shape to say the least
5418327 my father a wise man gave me a book by nathan pritikin
5418328 i followed this diet very carefully and of course i exercised a lot i lost close to seventy pounds and both my blood pressure and my bad cholesterol fell and i am feeling better than ever gout is gone
5418329 i know something about science and medicine one thing i have learned is this there are studies that prove everything mr moore to know the truth you can not just look at one current in the sea but ignore the whole sea
5418330 can you really deny the stories of people who participated in dr dean ornishs various studies can you deny their pet scans can you deny dr caldwell esselstyn who has had similar results can you deny dr john mcdougalls work which shows how a low fat vegan diet has helped so many folks
5418331 lets go backward from dr ornish before him there was nathan pritikin he suffered from bad heart disease he developed a low fat diet and began eating it before anyone argued it was a good idea by the way and guess what he reversed his own heart disease fact
5418332 in contrast to atkins by the way the full record of pritikins autopsy is public record
5418333 before pritikin the duke university rice diet saved many a persons life it is still around today by the way with a good emphasis on low fat diets and has helped millions but go back further read any social history book throughout human history in virtually every culture bread is the staff of life every cultures diet has a backbone of carbohydrate just think aztecs corn irish potatoes when there was no famine at least roman italian pasta bread asians all have rice as key diet component
5418334 for example i am an esl teacher i teach immigrants english i see how this works people come from their homelands where they eat diets rich in complex carbohydrates and low in fat they come here eat a high fat diet and boom they get american lifestyle diseases like heart disease i know you say it is the carbs but how can that be mexican people for example eat a diet rich in corn beans rich vegetables call rich in carbs and use meat as basically a condiment by this i mean their own home diets not americanized mexican restaurants which arent really mexican food among poor mexicans heart disease is nonexistent people in their seventies regularly work in the field ask anyone from rural mexico they come to america and eat too much fat and too many simple carbs and get sick i see this everyday
5418335 i know you lost weight and have kept it off but you are mortgaging your health to do it friend the plaque is building in your hearts arteries and along your veins it hurts me to see you promoting this diet you might tell me i wont be able to keep this off well i will write next year and show you but i will tell you this my father has done it the book he gave me was printed in the late seventies he in 71 years old and just retired from hard labor factory work
5418336 the livin la vida low carb show with jimmy moore
5418337 i care about you and hate to see you doing this to yourself
5418338 now this whole musharraf excuse is behind us now people are going to be focusing on their performance
5418339 we believe that respect for the democratic and constitutional processes in that country is fundamental to pakistans future and its fight against terrorism
5418340 it is very pleasing to know that musharraf is no more
5418341 he even tried to deceive the nation in his last address he was boasting about economic progress when life for people like us has become a hell
5418342 the government had been blaming musharraf for inflation power cuts and the weak economy and since now he has resigned we hope that the government will take steps to make our life better
5418343 selling our innocent brothers and sisters to america for dollars
5418344 his resignation clears the way for our government to get on with providing to the people of pakistan basic social services economic opportunities political security and law and order
5418345 its a huge challenge and they cannot face it individually its very important for them to work together and i think they know that
5418346 america wants some immediate decisions on fighting terrorism and i dont think they will be able to concentrate on that
5418347 the crimes of musharraf against the nation against the judiciary against democracy and against rule of law in the country cannot be forgiven by any party or individual
5418348 whatever one might say it may be difficult for the politicians to give him the indemnity
5418349 predicted from the start that the democratic majority would bury the impeachment
5418350 when democrats and republicans agreed to allow bush to disarm iraq they didnt agree to anything like what this horrific three hour tour has morphed into over the course of 5 years no way jose
5418351 a renegade no a clear thinker seems to be hears the music of the democrats but marches to his own drum
5418352 while youre at it denny remember to finish off the guy with frozen money and feinstein for lining her pockets with military money oh yeah id also love for you to look into the carbon credit company that will rake in billions of dollars of payola
5418353 to paraphrase a famous line from the ali frazier fight down goes kucinich
5418354 it astonishes me that the liberal media wasnt the least bit interested in this impeachment concerning lies murder and the loss of our constitution
5418355 we all knew the impeachment resolution wasnt going to go anywhere im still glad it was introduced and read into the public record
5418356 just show me the tape no judgment can be made at all until the tape is available and seen
5418357 the tape will come out before the convention you can bet your last tax dollar they sold many copies before they shut down that part of their website in march
5418358 if you are going to call everyone in the u
5418359 being an asian i must say your comment is very disturbing for a couple of reason s just because a number of people have called asians gooks in the past makes it in no shape or form okay at all to excuse such blatant racism
5418360 there is absolutely no comparison between calling people whitey and calling them n the emotional baggage simply isnt there its like calling someone filthy rich
5418361 mackiemesser who urged us once again to keep our powder dry and await further developments
5418362 my family and yours come first and most people in here know that they can safely drill and get this badly needed oil without leaving much of a footprint
5418363 obviously we know how to use oil gas coal and nuclear we need to exploit those while we heavily research wind solar biofuels geothermal etc
5418364 carter had the government spend a ton of money on that nasa headed up the scientific research on it they put up a bunch of experimental wind turbines and other forms of generating electricity all cost prohibitive
5418365 i sell components to ge wind and then the replacement parts its a huge cash cow that wouldnt be possible without huge government handouts
5418366 there is no real need to drill in anwr the bushites and their big oil pals know this but are merely trying to exploit consumer frustration at the pump to ruin yet another wildlife area for the sake of short term oil company profits

5418395 i am outraged by the comments that were made and saddened by the spectacle that we saw yesterday
5418396 plus there was at least one boob signing opportunity which really when you think about it is sort of what rock and roll is all about
5418397 i wish i was human so i can be in love with one spider and make a silk house for the two of us
5418398 i wish i can trade my silk with another spiders food when i run out of food
5418399 i wish i can dream so that i know that every night it will be a different adventure
5418400 i wish i can know what emotion is because there must be something other than hungry not hungry
5418401 i wish someone would remember me that i built this silk house or ate that many insects or have been in love with the most beautifully patterned spider of all
5418402 the image is too big please use the resize function when uploading the image
5418403 if you ever need to use a secret name to get into contact with me i want you to use andrea carlson
5418404 yes i just want to make sure we are on the same page
5418405 i think we need to change your secret code name
5418406 what was the name of your first pet was it b c
5418407 so now you want me to use my porn star name
5418408 the government is grateful for the vital and hard work which police officers carry out every day
5418409 i welcome sir clive booths report and accept the main recommendation that a pay review body for police officers should be created we will consult in the near future on proposals for implementing the necessary changes
5418410 people simply dont imagine how much loudspeaker 2000 pair can buy now yes id like to think people expect to get solid engineering from our loudspeakers but our designs have always been not so stylish last year we changed that with the synchrony line but with imagine we started with a blank sheet of paper and got industrial designer david farrage to guide the speakers appearance from that point on
5418411 after all these years you surely dont start with a blank sheet of paper
5418412 i have a certain way of designing speakers based upon what ive learned over the years and my measurements at the nrc in ottawa and i knew i wanted to use our new high output 5 5
5418413 as you see certain ideas began showing up in many of the designs
5418414 we can have this quality of construction at this price point because we make them in china of course
5418415 that happens yes but not to us lenbrook psbs owner has a hong kong office and we have five qc monitors who go to the plant every time we do a production run they examine one product out of every 10 made and determine whether or not the run is kosher they have the ability to cancel production runs so they have a lot of power
5418416 thats one of the things i love about operating in china all of the driver manufacturers set up these bazaars where they display their wares and a speaker designer like me can just stroll through and order this magnet system that diaphragm this basket and so on of course thats just for making a prototype we very carefully specced ceramic filled polypropylene for its low mass and inherent damping we tuned the magnet structures to give them greater sensitivity at declining frequencies which extends response without penalty in terms of cabinet volume and this aluminum phase plug actually reduces distortion by enhancing hf linearity
5418417 imagine that i seem to say that word a lot but its such an optimistic word imagine
5418418 what havent i talked about oh yes the crossover just the usual stuff i like to work with its a fourth order acoustic linkwitz reilly topology which just really has about the least time and frequency domain consequences ive learned to design them pretty well over the last 35 years
5418419 but we were seeing that this scrum stuff really works and that it was taking off and so we made a commitment to that method and released a free product purely focused on scrum
5418420 it was a stealth way under the radar type of approach
5418421 but people liked it and kept asking us for more features
5418422 because its meaning has been diluted by buzz everyone in the industry is agile now without necessarily having implemented one of these specific methods scrum on the other hand has been shepherded and protected by a core of practitioners the scrum alliance has been a strong advocate keeping it under control in terms of its implementation the other methods dont have that core support
5418423 it addresses the business side because it focuses on constantly prioritizing for return on investment yes there are iterations just like you see in xp or even rup rational unified process but its an incremental process as well youre turning out potentially shippable product with each iteration and the method allows for adaptation to emerging business realities because at the end of each sprint you can readjust your plan if the business dictates this is very powerful for companies that dont want to shoot off an arrow and hope that it hits the bulls eye six months later

5418617 since the coordinated release of these updates the threat to dns systems has increased due to a greater public understanding of the attacks as well as detailed exploit code being published on the internet
5418618 while microsoft admits no active attacks on their radar and they labeled the patch as important they are also subtlety saying that everyone needs to patch now because the risk is pretty large
5418619 the magnitude of the big picture problem is probably more clear now than when microsoft released the patch especially now that exploit code is out and has the capability of significant disruption of all dns dependent network activity

5418634 i am committed to helping young people find alternatives to gang life gangs of young people can cause fear in our communities and members are often involved in criminal activities which can lead to serious violence
5418635 i set up the tackling gangs action programme earlier this year to tackle gun and gang crime in four key areas within
5418636 the young people i have met today have turned their lives around and the x it project has played a vital part in offering them an alternative to a life of crime i am pleased to see such positive action being taken to tackle gang culture particularly when the action is led by the young people themselves this sends a powerful message that gangs and weapons on our streets will not be tolerated by any of us
5418637 the x it programme does fantastic work in keeping young people away from crime the young people here today many of whom are now working or off to university are proof that when given the opportunity they can put their energy to good use and achieve great things
5418638 not many of our young people get involved in crime but when they do it has a huge impact on their families friends and neighbours we know this is a top concern for lambeth residents and will continue to do all we can to help young people reach their full potential

5418671 i think its the best in the country its at the cutting edge and will be highly influential in the next decade
5418672 the first course anywhere in community psychology was at peabody in the late 50s
5418673 in 1965 nicholas hobbs gave his address as head of the american psychological association on project re ed and ecological strategies for helping emotionally disturbed children it was one of the earliest times ecology had been used in a psychology context the ecological approach says yes the person is important but it is critical to see the person in the context of environment at all levels it was a founding principle for project re ed and it is perhaps the major theoretical foundation for the field of community psychology peabody was there at the creation
5418674 in 1967 when i set up the center for community studies it was interdisciplinary by design and the research had to provide service to the community we had psychologists anthropologists social workers physicians that is when we set our sails for interdisciplinary studies
5418675 we were the only game in town in the late 60s and we had all kinds of requests for action research
5418676 so dean benbow asked me to write a rationale for a new department that would contain the undergraduate program in human and organizational development the masters program in human development counseling and a doctoral program in community psychology
5418677 as the 90s were coming to an end i was tempted to retire
5418678 but then the development of this department began and i now claim i will die with my boots on its very exciting
5418679 designed to train action researchers in applied community studies i e community psychology community development prevention and community health mental health organizational change and ethics in community research and action the title cra represents a commitment to social change through community based action research
5418680 im don quixote trying to change the catholic church doug perkins is working with metropolitan nashville we have students in new orleans we are out in the world
5418681 the cra approach posits the importance of context groups organizations institutions community and culture are important in understanding human behavior
5418682 it says that to understand human beings at the individual level you have to understand communities and this appeals to me as an anthropologist
5418683 our focus in ecuador was intercultural education the integration of indigenous peoples and african peoples into the school system in ecuador
5418684 these populations mobilized to insist on their rights and they have been largely successful how did they do that
5418685 most students are satisfied with secondary data from the government and other sources which they can then crunch and analyze we expect our graduate students to do original field work at the community level
5418686 our students also learn how to work in settings in communities and cultures not their own in this country and overseas often students who work in their own communities dont have much perspective on it because much is taken for granted
5418687 we put together a set of interview questions and walked all over the city to talk to people about community reconstruction media coverage to understand the effects of katrina on the communities of new orleans
5418688 we thought a lot of the research and coverage wasnt talking directly to people
5418689 i started the cra program with a few interests urban planning environmental psychology public participation im interested in how those converge in how people can be involved in building neighborhood and community and in how physical environments affect the people living in them
5418690 it was a moving experience to be in new orleans to walk through these neighborhoods that were vibrant and are now empty some places seemed fine back to normal and others seemed untouched by any response to the disaster
5418691 this can help them assess how they give away their millions
5418692 they are going to reconsider their funding formula based on the spec approach i think we are making a difference
5418693 the death of community psychology and the development of community research and action in the united states
5418694 as community psychologys viability within and influence on the broader field of psychology in the u s diminishes over time the transdisciplinary and international opportunities and reality of community research and action outside of academic psychology have never been better
5418695 we believe that it is fair that those who benefit most from using our immigration system should help fund it
5418696 we welcome the contribution that legal migrants make to the economy and cultural life in the uk and we have ensured that these fees which will usher in the biggest reforms to the immigration system in a generation are at levels that will not damage our international competitiveness
5418697 we are confident that we are not out of line with other countries prices and that the people we want to come here will not be deterred from doing so

5418747 state run gazprom supplies about a quarter of gas consumed in europe and ships about 75 percent of that volume through ukrainian pipelines
5418748 on sunday with no agreement on a new price russia cut by 120 million cubic meters a day the volume of gas it sent down the ukrainian pipeline ukraines share but there were soon reports that the volume of gas reaching austria italy france hungary poland slovakia romania and croatia at the other end had fallen by as much as 40 percent gazprom claimed that ukraine was stealing gas about 25 million worth on sunday alone according to alexander medvedev gazproms deputy chairman
5418749 with the aim of preventing a possible energy crisis caused by ukraine illegally taking gas gazprom has taken the decision to deliver additional gas into the gas transport system of ukraine
5418750 we stress that the additional delivery of gas is not designed for ukrainian consumers but is meant for transit through the territory of ukraine for delivery to consumers outside the borders of ukraine
5418751 germany sees the need to speed up building the pipeline so that the rest of europe will not be effected by russian actions against ukraine and former warsaw states

5418850 in 12 months time our immigration system will have changed out of all recognition from next year a points based system modelled on the success of australia will ensure that only people britain needs can come here to work and study
5418851 three quarters of the worlds population will need fingerprint visas a system which gives us tougher checks abroad
5418852 we will attack the root cause of illegal journeys which is illegal jobs with big new fast track fines for employers turning a blind eye or breaking the rules those who sponsor migrants to come to britain will need a licence to do so
5418853 driving these changes forward will be the new border and immigration agency operating with freedom from central government with a new powerful regulator and with much stronger links to the communities it serves
5418854 today we begin to strike a new balance in britains migration policy weighing the economic benefits with frontline feedback about wider impacts
5418855 we know migration added about 6 billion to our economy last year but we know of wider impacts too what we need to do is strike the right balance for britains national interest starting with the decision on bulgarian and romanian workers a little later this year
5418856 i am delighted that recent efforts by government and our enforcement partners on the ground to clamp down on underage sales are beginning to bite i know that the industry has made significant efforts in recent years to educate staff and strengthen procedures
5418857 it is clear that the challenge 21 policy is now becoming established as standard practice across the industry
5418858 i am under no illusions that we need to continue to restrict the availability of alcohol to the under 18s and challenge the behaviour of people whose drinking causes damage to themselves and those around them
5418859 thats why the governments alcohol strategy published this summer outlined how we will use new laws and licensing powers to bear down on irresponsibly managed bars pubs and off licenses at the same time as giving everyone the information they need to drink safely and responsibly
5418860 during this campaign 22 premises were caught selling alcohol to under 18s three times they now face a fine of up to 10 000 a ban on selling alcohol to anyone for three months and a review of their licence a further 224 premises were caught twice and could have their licences reviewed
5418861 the bars and shops that have been caught out will be nervously awaiting the outcome of action taken against them which could mean tens of thousands of pounds of lost alcohol sales
5418862 these results show that the situation in relation to underage sales has improved and the industry has played a major part in delivering this improvement however underage sales still remains an issue and the industry needs to maintain its focus on it
5418863 for our part the police service will continue to work with trading standards making use of targeted test purchase operations and the new powers in the licensing act to target problem premises
5418864 we are very pleased to see that this further reduction in the test purchase failure rate reflects the efforts that have been made in this area particularly around challenge 21
5418865 retailers have worked closely together with the police and trading standards to share best practice on how we can best reduce opportunities for young people to purchase alcohol there is still more to do and we will continue to work in partnership as part of our commitment to sell alcohol safely and responsibly

5418878 the talent and commitment necessary to develop as a scientific leader require both personal attributes and learning environments that are truly beyond the norm
5418879 not surprisingly the personal attributes of future science mathematics engineering and technology leaders reveal that it takes much more than exceptional abilities to truly develop exceptional scientific expertise
5418880 these findings come at a time when our nation is gathering its diverse resources to ensure that we are positioned to compete in a flat technology driven world
5418881 supporting and cultivating our most intellectually gifted students is critical to maintaining our economic competitiveness globally this research will help educators identify those students who have the most potential to become exceptional professionals and leaders in science technology engineering and mathematics
5418882 we found that mathematical gifts and a variety of aptitudes have a significant impact but that special educational opportunities and commitment can dramatically increase this impact
5418883 these students are intellectually gifted and those gifts are best fully realized when they have the full support and understanding of their teachers their parents and their social network
5418884 exceptional verbal ability is characteristic of participants whose favorite courses college majors and occupations were in the social sciences and humanities whereas higher levels of mathematical and spatial abilities characterize participants whose favorite courses college majors and occupations were in engineering and math or computer science
5418885 given the ever increasing importance of quantitative and scientific reasoning skills in modern cultures when mathematically gifted individuals choose to pursue careers outside engineering and the physical sciences it should be seen as a contribution to society not a loss of talent

5418914 site last migrated thursday february 07 2008 4 04 29 pm mst
5418915 as i mentioned earlier were still focusing our efforts on getting the performance of both sites 1 0 and 2 0 up to where wed like it to be unfortunately when we turned the updates back on it almost brought down the entire 1 0 service so we are revisiting how we do the updates
5418916 i am co administrator of a site that is migrated but not yet activated it updates once in a blue moon and i understand that there are updating problems
5418917 i know you try lynne and you can only say what you are told
5418918 allow recipients to forward the invitation to others without restriction
5418919 we are currently fixing some of the migration related bugs weve uncovered and providing support for additional content types such as files albums trees in addition to new features to help round out the 2 0 service we are also making changes that will improve service speed and reliability
5418920 i am working on a post on my site to get help with html code because it keeps deleting the centering code for some text yet another problem
5418921 i like this so much id like to pay for it
5418922 we decided to make the essentials paid site available because we receive requests every day from folks who want to know how to turn off ads etc
5418923 sorry but we have some customers who like it this way
5418924 for now the date taken defaults to date uploaded if the date is in a format the 2 0 system doesnt accept
5418925 oh yeah the cursor does not go to the text box and the screen does not display the text box
5418926 i am not sure if my emails are getting through so could you please resply that you received this thank you
5418927 as a result we will not be expanding migration beyond the current set of migrated sites for the next few weeks while we address many of these items regular updates will continue for sites that have already been migrated
5418928 on the site which i assume will be my migrated site eventually
5418929 i like this so much id like to pay for it
5418930 on the site which i assume will be my migrated site eventually
5418931 it may just be that the members are the only thing that has actually migrated at this point
5418932 is the site i found by accident listed under my membership tab that has only my members listed my migrated site
5418933 why change something that was so good to something that doesnt work
5418934 we understand how this feature is useful to admins however weve also gotten feedback from members who do not like to have their activities tracked we need to find the right balance
5418935 please note that the new site is currently a beta or test site this gives us a way to try out new features weve been working on without changing the current myfamily com site the beta site doesnt yet have all the features we offer on the current site but were working on adding your favorite features to the new beta site over the coming months
5418936 mark all as read and it will mark all unread posts as being read and remove them from the area and the whats new area on the front page
5418937 there is nothing in the terms of service that requires anyone to read every posting
5418938 managing username amp passwords for members once we turn updates back on you should be able to update a members username or password on 1 0 and have this carried over to 2 0
5418939 and this blog is ridiculous a very quick way to lose your loyal members for heavens sake please start a new thread we cannot do it as we dont own it
5418940 how would my grandmother or grandfather handle getting on this site

5418942 kyle doesnt work for mfamily he is a volunteer he gives of his time freely to come here and try to answer questions i think that is a pretty nice thing to do not to mention brave he seems to be taking a lot of flak and i would say most of it is undeserved
5418943 if you want to be respected you must respect those you wish to respect you
5418944 so in april 2008 we announced that we will continue to support myfamily com 1 0 and we will not require 1 0 sites to migrate to the new 2 0 system however if you now or at some point in the future want to voluntarily migrate your 1 0 site to 2 0 stay tuned well soon be updating this migration help center with complete details on how to do so

5418947 im having extreme difficulty getting the obama campaign to commit to this event and we do not understand why

5419002 i recognize that plastic bags can be a litter problem but so can plenty of other products
5419003 this reminds of the debate over requiring stores to collect deposits for cans and bottles a measure justified as a way to reduce roadside litter but states without mandatory deposits like texas and washington showed that the most cost effective way to reduce litter was to hire clean up crews to pick up everything not just cans
5419004 not everyone can or will do that on every shopping trip
5419005 even if paper bags last as long in landfills as plastic which i doubt
5419006 and if you ban plastic bags at the grocery stores as some governments have done the practical effect is to force more people to use paper bags for their groceries
5419007 above 50 mph it s more fuel efficient to run the a c than to roll down the windows the obvious caveat is that fuel efficiency and aerodynamic drag vary from car to car but unless i had better figures for my own car i wouldn t feel guilty running the a c above 50
5419008 ive let down my hard headed realist colleagues by choosing fuel efficiency

5419010 i think your worrying readers sense the ideological bent of your column
5419011 to say it wouldn t work in the u s is cynical the people in ireland are no more eco friendly liberal green than in the u s
5419012 you can fit quite a bit more in a paper bag than you can in a plastic bag not to mention that plastic bags are almost always double bagged at many grocery stores

5419021 the identity and passport service and the general register office for england and wales are already working closely together
5419022 in order to take this work a step further and fully realise the benefits of combining registration of life events in england and wales and the issuing of passports it is sensible that the ips and gro should be part of the same organisation
5419023 the general register office joining the identity and passport service is welcome news working as one organisation will allow us to explore the possibility of integrating passport identity card and life event registration processes this would reduce red tape and make life easier for people as well as strengthen the integrity of our systems

5419028 the scorecard tells us that we are losing ground in crucial areas like access to health care
5419029 we now have 75 million americans who are uninsured or underinsured poor access pulls down quality and drives up costs of care the u s leads the world on health care spending we should expect a far better return on our investment
5419030 its apparent that overall the health care system is performing unevenly and well below its potential
5419031 while there are pockets of improvement and excellence it is clear that we need strong leadership and concerted public and private efforts to achieve and raise standards of performance nationwide and ensure that significant progress occurs in the future
5419032 oh this is a nice color are you doing this light green
5419033 getting guns off our streets is a top priority for the government and the day of action sends a strong message to criminals and the community that weapons wont be tolerated
5419034 i and my colleagues from the ministerial taskforce were updated on this work yesterday and id like to extend my thanks to all the police forces and their partners involved in yesterdays operations
5419035 yesterdays success proves that gun crime can be tackled and communities can stand up against the intimidation of guns
5419036 tragedies involving young people have a profound effect on all neighbourhoods chief officers across the police service share the desire to work with government to address the causes of gun and gang related violence in the most affected areas over the long term
5419037 neighbourhood policing is key to this success and can be highly effective in delivering the sustainable solutions we require looking forward the challenge is to develop an approach which combines local and strategic policing to tackle and defeat this corrosive problem
5419038 hmrc undertake anti gun smuggling operations to ensure lethal weapons and replica firearms do not find their way on to the streets of our towns and cities
5419039 these efforts have been effective and in the past year having led to the seizure over 700 firearms including replica guns shotguns and stun guns along with more than 4 000 rounds of ammunition we have seen successful prosecutions in the last year with prison sentences ranging from three and a half years to 12 years for the illegal shipment of weapons ranging from handguns to assault rifles

5419053 the people who troll for music on mp3 blogs tend to be tastemakers who wield considerable influence over their peers
5419054 we are determined to break the link between drunkenness and anti social behaviour people need to face up to the damage that excessive drinking can do to themselves and those around them these pilots will complement powers already available to the police to tackle alcohol related disorder including on the spot fines confiscating alcohol in public places and closing down premises that flout the law i look forward to seeing the first assessments of the projects in spring next year
5419055 the arrest referral pilots represent a real move forward in achieving the governments commitment to tackling alcohol fuelled violent crime it is not enough to just punish those who commit such crimes we need actively to work with people to change the drinking patterns that lead to trouble
5419056 providing people with active personalised advice about their drinking promises good results in breaking the link between alcohol and violent crime we applaud the government for this initiative
5419057 we hope that giving advice about safer drinking to those arrested for different types of alcohol related offences will help to reduce crime in the areas taking part in these pilots changing attitudes and encouraging sensible drinking alongside effective enforcement action should help to tackle the root cause of crime associated with the night time economy
5419058 i know that referral schemes can deliver substantial reductions in re offending among those who have been arrested for alcohol related offences the alcohol referral pilots should reduce re offending in participating areas as well as identifying best practice for the benefit of all alcohol referral schemes

5419176 now we all know nfs is already making nfs12 this is undisputed we however do not know which direction the game is going according to a small section in a fiscal blog at gamespot link below they had stated quite specifically that the game will be going towards its old roots but once again with a new twist quoted from gamespot news ea games president frank gibeau also mentioned the next installment in another of eas racing franchises need for speed while a new need for speed in development isnt surprising the franchise has been annualized since 2002s need for speed hot pursuit 2 gibeau did give the analysts an early look at the direction ea would be taking with the next installment of the series noting that sales of last years need for speed prostreet didnt live up to eas hopes for the game gibeau said he thinks it was because the series drifted too far from what consumers expected prostreet had dropped the tuner culture and police evasion aspects of previous installments in favor of perfectly legit closed track racing for the next need for speed gibeau promised that the series would be getting back to its roots with a number of features including open world racing and a new highway battle mode the funny thing is that tuners are not the roots of need for speed however the police have always been a welcome addition to any nfs

5419191 it has been argued that in soa terms a service is a very specific thing that would exclude the kinds of granular services an ria would call
5419192 im not currently buying into that line of thinking there are going to be at least an order of magnitude more services written for rias than there are services more for traditional mainstream soa applications 000 something that would feed business processes why wouldnt you want the benefits that we talk about for soa in rias
5419193 creating data services mashups for soa amp web 2 0
5419194 we feel that one of the inhibitors to soa all along has been the lack of data at the right level of granularity
5419195 soa is all about providing data at the proper level of granularity with a data services layer you can construct your services at the right level to supply your orchestration layer so that your processes now look a lot more like something a business analyst can understand long term thats whats going to allow soa to work properly
5419196 the developer has to show a customer view for example that includes his name address and recent order history so they have a tendency to think about getting data quickly and dont bother me with process im not going to my center of excellence to find out where to get a customer address
5419197 i think typically its driven by some smart architects or people on the it side trying to align better with the business
5419198 theyre thinking more about driving the business into it so naturally youre going to get more governance related requirements falling out of that youre going to want to manage those services so to make sure that theyre not replicated but the ria developer isnt going to care so much whether somebody else is calling a getaddress service
5419199 the whole governance realm would get an allergic reaction from an ria developer
5419200 if we can make that automatic and transparent then that would remove one inhibitor to an ria guy using more soa style technologies
5419201 maybe theres some middle ground where a couple of related sections on the screen map to a data service
5419202 the idea would be to drive reusability of that service but both sides should be driving towards commonality reusability and agility

5419223 the guy says in a heavy bavarian accent if the people from catalonia come to bavaria they have to be able to speak proper bavarian would have been funny if he asks them to speak proper german because he speaks proper bavarian but maybe it is about the bavarians trying to have their own state in a similar way to the catalans as some catalan people insist that all the people who come to catalonia should speak catalan instead of spanish j
5419224 visca el catal i fora els que viuen de sa cultura sin fer res
5419225 the thing is that it s even for me very hard to understand because it is not really german you know it s bavarian dialekt which none in germany does understand except the bavarians but let s have a try
5419226 but these days it s more like teasing each other so calling catalan people this doesn t mean they don t really like you

5419229 while it is reassuring to note that a high percentage of quality managers 87 believed that patient care at their hospitals today was better than three years earlier the finding that only one third felt that quality of care and patient satisfaction levels today compared with where they should be had exceeded their expectations suggests that improvement is still needed
5419230 it also appears that qi implementation is an evolutionary process that takes years perhaps a decade or longer to transform a hospital into a high performing organization
5419231 these findings are consistent with studies citing the lack of physician involvement in qi efforts as a barrier to improvement
5419232 yet only 31 per cent of all sample hospitals reported hospital wide use of specific strategies to reduce the number of patients assigned to each nurse and another 35 percent reported minimal or no use of these strategies
5419233 although progress toward improved patient care is being made in many hospitals there is a clear need for greater innovation and creativity sustained achievement of performance gains and concerted effort by managers clinicians and policy makers to attain organizational and systemwide quality goals

5419258 we have little choice but to construct a new architecture for east asia if east asia does not coalesce it will lose out to the americas and europe the key question is not whether east asia will integrate it is how quickly and the form east asian regionalism will assume
5419259 asian leaders agreed wednesday to create a new loosely united regional grouping including india and australia to work together on combating asias economic security and political problems
5419260 as asia has become an increasingly important region in terms of economic weight so we have seen asian governments strengthen their call for a greater formal role in international affairs not least in the councils of organizations like the international monetary fund the fund managements position on this issue is clear we recognize that asia has a powerful and legitimate claim to greater weight in the fund than allowed for under the current rules asia has a voice of course it wields considerable influence in fund discussions but it is clearly under represented this issue is firmly on the agenda of the funds shareholders ahead of the next annual meetings in singapore next year

5419269 it costs more money to put someone to death then to let them live out their life behind bars can you give the numbers on this i find that hard to believe but dont know so i cant say for sure
5419270 we found that there is an average of 16 173 infected web pages on a daily basis
5419271 we arrived at this conclusion from our labs around the world we look at millions of e mails and web page transmissions on a daily basis and it averages out to one infected page every five seconds
5419272 what weve seen with these attacks is that even if you clean up the database and get rid of the virus there it could either be just a decoy for another injection attack or another virus will come along soon
5419273 hackers have by and large stopped using e mail as an entry point and instead decided to frame their attacks in and around the web browser
5419274 big companies may have the infrastructure and the money to act but the real necessity here is for small and medium sized businesses to reassess internet security this is clearly an opportunity for channel partners as well as enterprises themselves to collaborate and get involved whether its a consultant for the business or an internal mandate

5419278 a couple more minutes then it is time for bed
5419279 two items of the same sort that are somehow associated
5419280 i was interested in the big picture issues like how cultures shape peoples thinking
5419281 at the same time i was interested in children and especially in trying to make a difference for children in low income communities
5419282 it was really only when i moved to graduate school that i ended up gravitating into the early childhood area and that was because i got interested in language development
5419283 when i was teaching in west philadelphia i was working with an all african american population from working class homes
5419284 were going to implement a curriculum that i helped to write with judy schickedanz called opening the world of learning owl
5419285 it provides a lot of guidance to teachers in ways that help children build their knowledge of the world and their vocabulary as well as basic literacy skills
5419286 ann has been developing this over a number of years and shes used it for children with significant language delays or behavior problems as well as children with autism and with down syndrome well be targeting the lowest children in these classrooms in a very focused way that we think can have major effects on their language and early literacy development
5419287 prior to this i did a descriptive study where we followed low income children from age three up into middle school
5419288 we observed their experiences in homes and classrooms and found that the experiences in the classrooms accounted for as much variation in outcomes in kindergarten and then fourth and seventh grade as did our measures of the home background people would never have expected that the preschool quality measures could match the impact of the parents
5419289 as the importance of phonemic awareness and alphabet knowledge has become well established its turned into performance standards for preschools and kindergarten so preschools are now under pressure for instruction that they never experienced before the danger is that teachers start doing direct instruction in letters and numbers and colors and sounds but it doesnt include these broader language skills theres the potential for a narrowing of the preschool curriculum to things that schools were pretty good at doing already
5419290 were just beginning to understand the possible impact that rich learning experiences in preschool can have on children it may be very critical
5419291 the well known one from high scope has followed children out from four year old programs into adult life and you see enduring effects the abecedarian project has followed people to age 21 whether the effects are around academics or whether theyre around children acquiring the abilities to regulate their attention to relate to others to function in groups thats not so evident
5419292 there have been several studies in addition to the one that i did that indicate that the richness of language in preschool and kindergarten has effects that appear later in fourth and fifth grade reading
5419293 its not clear what the mechanism for that is it might simply be that the accumulation of good strong vocabularies when children are four and five becomes the pool of words they need for later reading if they are in rich environments they get them but if they are not in supportive environments in homes and classrooms they may go without classrooms have been repeatedly shown to be pretty weak settings for teaching language and vocabulary skills so they may not pick up the vocabulary in school it also may be that if you get children starting to use language productively they become self teaching mechanisms
5419294 that getting a rich infusion of language experience at this point will have effects on later language on literacy and maybe on phonemic awareness
5419295 just in the last few years the field has begun to recognize the important of language partly that comes from attending to the needs of children from low income and second language backgrounds where issues of language learning are of particular importance
5419296 in the longitudinal study i did the quality of the teachers spontaneous conversations with children as they engaged in centers activities was the strongest single predictor of how children did better other predictors were things like the quality of conversations during book reading and the intellectual content of group meetings so the kinds of interactions the teachers engaged the children in are important all the research on mother child interactions or father child interactions makes clear that children learn language as they interact with somebody whos listening to them and supporting them it seems that thats probably the most important activity in preschools too
5419297 what ive done essentially is create a kind of university course for preschool teachers
5419298 many preschool teachers dont have foundational knowledge about language and literacy development i focus on the importance of engaging children in extended conversations on being responsive to them and on helping children extend their thinking
5419299 im trying to help the teachers become more aware of how they interact with the children and the quality of the language thats coming from the children
5419300 this is why im so concerned about a narrowing of the curriculum
5419301 you can teach a four year old to recognize an a but theyre going to learn to recognize an a in kindergarten probably
5419302 my data suggest that these language skills may be one area that is going to have sustained long term effects and if we dont target these with four year olds who are coming from at risk backgrounds they may not get it when they get to kindergarten and they may never quite recover from that
5419303 it doesnt matter how many years experience you have being a teacher is hard this is a hard job
5419304 when i saw the first videotape i had to sit down
5419305 when centers were going on i would take over the center i call it the bulldozer effect i would not take the time to observe to stay back wait and see what the children were doing
5419306 pat is a teacher who was very engaged instructionally she wanted to make sure kids were learning all the time but she never let the kids talk there was not a space for the children in the conversation
5419307 but because shes a really committed hard working smart teacher all i needed to do was have a session with her and say these are the important things this is what a good conversation looks like and then start the process of reflection
5419308 im playing a tambourine and an empty kitty litter jug with my feet
5419309 i welcome this significant new investment for security and counter terrorism matters the funding will improve our ability to tackle the immediate threat to the uk strengthen our security measures to protect the uk from attack allow the development of new technology which will enable us to keep ahead of the terrorists and put in place longer term programmes to counter radicalisation

5419311 worst video game i have ever played and or owned
5419312 i think ea called take two and said you can either participate or not
5419313 i think take two is going to negotiate a dollar per share higher and then claim victory a deal is going to get done
5419314 that 25 74 was predicated on distributing their products at christmas this year
5419315 going forward we are challenged to validate that 25 74 price
5419316 a mutual deal is going to have to be higher than 25 74 in order for the board of take two to save face call it a dollar or two dollars more
5419317 the integration risk is that you lose the talent and ea cant afford to lose the talent
5419318 well how many people do you think you can motivate
5419319 im not sure i follow you how can i put a number on it
5419320 i already know the number im asking you what you think it is can you motivate ten people or a hundred or a thousand
5419321 dad i am sure that i can motivate a roomful of people put me in a big enough room and i can motivate ten thousand people
5419322 you know what dad get me on tv and i can motivate a million
5419323 that would be pretty good if you could motivate a million people but the answer is exactly one
5419324 there is only one person that you can motivate and that person is yourself you can not motivate anyone else to do anything
5419325 i see what you are saying dad but i dont agree there is no question that every single day at work i am getting people pumped up to do their job better i do this by setting a good example of what a hard worker looks like and by having a positive attitude i am able to convey my positivity to the other workers and motivate them to do a good job
5419326 you are no doubt setting a good example and being positive is great but i am telling you that the only person that you are able to motivate is yourself
5419327 well i didnt really care about the day off since we are paid on commission
5419328 hi im deaf but i can read lips and id like to talk to you

5419543 i teach people who are visually impaired how to get around such as spatial skills and cane skills you end up adapting anything that you are going to use with the student you cant buy this curriculum off the shelf
5419544 we believe tessa and her nclvi colleagues will have a broad impact on this field
5419545 we are especially proud of the number of former students from the program in visual disabilities who have been selected through a highly competitive process to become nclvi fellows and of our programs ability to recruit and graduate teachers with the skills to become leaders in the fields of visual impairment and blindness
5419546 two of the many reasons for the shortage of professionals ready to take university level positions or positions in administration or public policy have been that few students are graduating with ph d s in this specialization and there have been closures or reductions of faculties in many universities that prepare these teachers

5419555 president herbert hoovers 1929 committee on recent economic changes observed in glowing terms the results
5419556 economically we have a boundless field before us that there are new wants which will make way endlessly for newer wants as fast as they are satisfied
5419557 our modern predicament is a case in point by 2005 per capita household spending in inflation adjusted dollars was twelve times what it had been in 1929 while per capita spending for durable goods the big stuff such as cars and appliances was thirty two times higher and according to reports by the federal reserve bank in 2004 and 2005 over 40 percent of american families spend more than they earn the average household carries 18 654 in debt not including home mortgage debt and the ratio of household debt to income is at record levels having roughly doubled over the last two decades we are quite literally working ourselves into a frenzy just so we can consume all that our machines can produce
5419558 we have impoverished our human communities with a form of materialism that leaves us in relative isolation from family friends and neighbors we simply dont have time for them unlike our great grandparents who passed the time we spend it an outside observer might conclude that we are in the grip of some strange curse like a modern day king midas whose touch turns everything into a product built around a microchip

5419625 the governments first priority is to protect our citizens we are facing an unprecedented threat from terrorism in this country and are determined to take whatever action is necessary to protect the public from future attacks
5419626 this counter terrorism bill contains a broad range of measures to ensure the police and others have the tools they need to deal with the terrorist threat it will help to strengthen terrorist prosecutions and our ability to deal with terrorist suspects after they have been charged
5419627 we all need to work together to tackle the terrorist challenge and we have consulted widely on the proposed measures we have listened to the concerns of community groups and others and the proposals brought forward today aim to strike the right balance between the need to protect human rights and ensuring police have the powers they need when they need them to tackle terrorism
5419628 todays bill is one part of a much wider package of work we are doing on counter terrorism more generally and builds on our cross government strategy to prevent people becoming terrorists in the first place by challenging extremist ideology and by supporting communities in rooting out its influence

5419638 i have had several major donors indicate to me that they have never donated to someone outside of the metro area before

5419641 dealing with some of the legacy of discrimination is going to cost billions of dollars
5419642 i am very pleased by the positive reaction of the volunteers in this joint venture between the crb and ips
5419643 clearly establishing identity quickly and accurately is absolutely crucial when dealing with people who want to work with children or vulnerable adults employers have to make sure that the person applying for the job is actually who they say they are
5419644 by linking your details to your fingerprints the national identity scheme will make it easier and quicker to prove identity as well as protecting your personal details from fraudsters
5419645 the crb constantly works to enhance its processes and accuracy the national identity scheme will help make the criminal record check even faster and more robust
5419646 that is good news for employers and employees and good news for the children and vulnerable people they work with
5419647 ips and the crb have been in close collaboration to explore how the national identity scheme can help further strengthen the crb process in particular around verifying the identity of an applicant for a crb disclosure
5419648 as we move forward with procurement and delivery of the scheme we are also taking forward other joint ventures with organisations such as the border and immigration agency and retailers
5419649 this organization got itself in trouble because it had a chairperson that also acted as chief executive officer
5419650 that mode of operation contributed in one way or another to get us in the position were in right now
5419651 if the contract had been read we wouldnt have all these problems

5419699 i can apply what i learn the very next week
5419700 we are using our studies to inform our day to day work
5419701 the question is whether education schools and their leadership programs will attempt reforms necessary to curb current trends
5419702 the strengths of peabody include the quality of students the strong credentials of the faculty and the attitude there that the ed d should be a practical degree for practitioners
5419703 the field has been in turmoil for 15 years now his is just the latest salvo in a series of calls for national reform
5419704 if theres anything wrong with his findings its that hes two or three years behind the curve because many programs have begun to change
5419705 despite levines lament and a long list of polemics by others historic conditions and present day political and economic realities render it almost impossible to concentrate on ed d reforms alone
5419706 the doctor of education degree and the doctor of philosophy in education degree are inexorably related neither the ed d nor ph d in education will be a legitimate widely accepted advanced degree until the purposes they serve are clear and separate and the standards accompanying their pursuit are elevated the ed d will not get better until education schools upgrade the ph d as well
5419707 degrees should prepare you for the work youre going to do
5419708 i think the ed d has lost credibility because there are schools that compromise it
5419709 universities are becoming so market driven that they have to do what the customers want and that has diluted the degree but it can still have value i have found the peabody program invaluable
5419710 the ed d is all over the map it means different things depending on where you graduated
5419711 in general i dont know the difference between the ed d and the ph d these days
5419712 the most important thing is what they learn and how practical it is thats the reality with some degrees the graduates have book knowledge but they arent practitioners if i am looking at three candidates for a job and one has a ph d and one an ed d and the third has neither degree i dont think one or the other is automatically the strongest what i want to know is can they interpret data use data teach reading care for kids can they supervise and evaluate can they improve schools based on results
5419713 anything that happens in education takes a long time to unfold but i think hes had remarkable influence so far
5419714 the ed d is an established credential and if a certain percentage of people have their doctorate you dont want to be the first to go without it
5419715 the report has produced a conversation larger than i imagined
5419716 the recommendation to eliminate the ed d was so radical it made the other recommendations seem more reasonable
5419717 we need to get school districts to change their reward system
5419718 the market will resist change in the short term but cause change in the long term
5419719 the changes happening in schools are of such depth and such rapidity that its all shocking for baby boomers and gen xers and everyone else
5419720 weve seen a revolution in schooling weve moved from a focus on the processes of teaching to a focus on outcomes of learning industrial cultures care about process post industrial cultures care about outcome the old question was how well can miss jones teach the new bottom line question is what improves student achievement in the future the degree for preparing leaders might not be called the m e a but it wont be called a doctorate
5419721 most modern day parents recognize this changed condition and they have expressed a political preference for better schools
5419722 policy officials have responded and no child left behind much to many educators lament is the new education reality regardless of nclb deficiencies to wish that it go away is tantamount to standing on the shore and ordering the waves to roll backwards
5419723 nclb symbolizes a dramatic turning point in american education this legislation however awkward in its initial implementation marks the departure from judging schools by inputs now it is what schools achieve not what resources they receive that matters most
5419724 if a select few institutions would band together announce adherence to high admission and performance standards and orient their curriculum toward professional practice it might begin to crystallize a set of highly visible high standards high performing institutions
5419725 such an academic compact of ed d excellence would have to possess either external or self policing capacity regarding adherence to announced standards
5419726 the doctorate is the coin of the realm in education
5419727 we shouldnt give it up we should transform it what makes peabodys ed d a doctorate is it represents advanced study of the profession a dedication to practice and reflection instruction informed by the issues that drive the professional
5419728 i look at the people im studying with and they want to be outstanding leaders in their particular area my feeling is schools of education have an obligation to stay connected to practitioners of education ed d degree programs that value practice ought to continue to do well in this country

5419770 what exactly is a socially and environmentally destructive corporation is that nomenclature reserved for the worst of the worst or do most big companies qualify
5419771 have left many companies confused and conflicted unwilling to talk about what theyre doing right however imperfect for fear that such communications will brand them with the g word as a result many companies ive talked to have clammed up keeping their green initiatives largely to themselves
5419772 put it all together and its not the travesty some would make it out to be the rise of environmental marketing claims indicates that companies are engaged as never before perhaps not sufficiently but engaged
5419773 so is greenwashing disinformation disseminated by an organization so as to present an environmentally responsible public image on the rampage i think not
5419774 should we beat up big companies or cheer them on i vote for the latter
5419775 the problem is that there are no universal industry standards or certifications for sustainability
5419776 how can you bash companies for greenwashing when there is no standard to measure them against
5419777 a dynamic process that simultaneously protects and enhances the earths life support systems
5419778 a company thats doing its best to be green is what it says it is its actions align with its words it reveals its flaws and its missteps as well as its successes because it turns out there is a green god after all and its not you or i its all of us

5419784 when using adaptive aa the driver analyses the current rendering and decides whether supersampling or multisampling is needed in order to improve the quality of the current transparent object we found that the old controls in the panel were confusing for some of our users as the presence of the drop down box implied that they could select between supersampling and multisampling whereas actually the box simply controlled whether the tuning controls for the supersampling or multisampling portion of the adaptive aa mode were being displayed in the panel the driver behaviour has not changed and the control panel interface has been altered to be simpler and less confusing
5419785 the cfaa filters are transparent to the application so they will work in essentially all cases at the moment cfaa is supported in the dx9 and opengl drivers and does not function in dx10 applications but full dx10 support is coming very soon in the case of dx10 applications if the developer writes their own custom aa filter which is one of the new capabilities that developers have in dx10 then our custom filter will not be applied in order to guarantee that the developer gets the result that they wanted an example of a dx10 game where the developer has written their own custom aa filter to improve image quality is call of juarez in this title cfaa will not operate

5419824 you dont want to use my website you want to go to the dog park
5419825 ah how did i not even think id want to do this
5419826 uh maybe if this gets big i could drop out and be the dogster japan guy
5419827 thats the kind of thing that would turn into a book
5419828 what problems do i have what problems to i see people on blogs talking about that i could solve
5419829 oh i dont think you need to be fighting about that lets look at this cute picture over here
5419830 as part of the class i was going to maplewood high school and mentoring a student and also teaching a weekly seminar to seniors about how to apply to college
5419831 at the end of the class only one of the 20 students in the seminar had a mentor
5419832 she emerged early on as someone who was picking up the ball a very important piece in the success of any service project
5419833 i wasnt surprised by the response just thrilled by it
5419834 because it is a program that is mostly african american vanderbilt students helping african american high school students i knew people would feel a personal commitment to help
5419835 in the class vanderbilt students mentor youth from low income high schools and help them with the college application process they also learn more about themselves about inequalities across high schools and about the effect of poverty on youth and families
5419836 its a win win youth are gaining from the mentoring and the university students are seeing what they learn in class come alive
5419837 i also believe that because many vanderbilt students will be in leadership positions they will be in a better position to advocate for social service programs school funding and more support for people from low income backgrounds
5419838 theyve found out its pretty easy to make friends with people with whom they didnt think they had anything in common
5419839 we have three objectives for this grant the first is to conduct high school mentoring and outreach to at risk youth at three high poverty low performing high schools in north nashville
5419840 the second is to help community college faculty integrate service learning into their curricula the third objective is to create the tennessee campus compact a state entity that will leverage resources and promote academic service learning community service and civic engagement statewide
5419841 there is a gap that has been recognized for some high school students in accessing college
5419842 this program should help narrow that gap across the state and has the potential to become a national model
5419843 the response has been tremendous it seems to be fairly unique to have a university based mentoring model
5419844 well thats why i dont like to shop here the customer is always right you need to learn that thats why i like to shop at wal mart

5419855 using the inmate labor would be a pretty cost effective way to build
5419856 this will make it a little bit easier for us to handle and by separating the work release it will also cut down on contraband
5419857 we have to do something these inmates dont deserve to sleep on the floor
5419858 this provides incentives for them to get their fines and bills paid
5419859 we cant just have them sitting in a 6 by 6 jail cell all day we like to get them out

5419861 the record level of investment in the police that this government has made is making a real difference to the performance of the police and the safety of the neighbourhoods and communities they serve
5419862 the figures out today show improvements in tackling crime more offences brought to justice and greater satisfaction among victims of crimes in the police forces who help them
5419863 and there are more improvements to come by next april all communities will have a neighbourhood policing team and we are reviewing how we can reduce bureaucracy we have invested to strengthen the police and that has delivered real improvements for the public we can now build on that and continue to drive up performance
5419864 i am pleased to note that following last years inspection most forces have conducted major reviews and implemented significant improvements in the area of protecting vulnerable persons
5419865 our other major inspection has been in the area of neighbourhood policing where i am pleased to see there has been a general improvement in the grades awarded this large project will improve the everyday lives of many of our citizens and hmic will follow up its inspection activity in 2008 to support its delivery

5419869 it should also be noted that courts dont have the power to strike down laws in sweden not even unconstitutional ones unless in extreme cases so extreme that even this one wont trigger the necessary prerequisites in general if a majority of lawmakers want to create a law that counters the constitution theres nothing stopping them because theres no counterpower

5419876 people should not be afraid of their governments governments should be afraid of their people
5419877 under the us constitutions view of copyright if the public prefers to be able to make copies in certain cases even if that means somewhat fewer works are published the publics choice is decisive there is no possible justification for prohibiting the public from copying what it wants to copy ever since the constitutional decision was made publishers i e of movies amp music have tried to reverse it by misinforming the public they do this by repeating arguments which presuppose that copyright is a natural right of authors not mentioning that authors almost always cede it to publishers people who hear these arguments unless they have a firm awareness that this presupposition is contrary to the basic premises of our legal system take for granted that it is the basis of that system this error is so ingrained today that people who oppose new copyright powers feel the need to do so by arguing that even authors and publishers may be hurt by them thus james boyle explains how a strict intellectual property system can interfere with writing new works jessica litman cites the copyright shelters which historically allowed many new media to become popular pamela samuelson warns that the white paper may block the development of third wave information industries by locking the world into the second wave economic model that fit the age of the printing press
5419878 the danger is that we may allow the publishers to replace the constitution uncontested
5419879 conspicuously absent from the list is the most important reason of all that many americans perhaps most want to continue making copies the dfc fails to criticize the core goal of the white paper which is to give more power to publishers and its central decision to reject the constitution and place the publishers above the users
5419880 resisting the pressure for additional power for publishers depends on widespread awareness that the reading and listening public are paramount that copyright exists for users and not vice versa if the bobe on 06 19 21 01 continued from above no more lengthy posts like this again i promise public is unwilling to accept certain copyright powers that is ipso facto justification for not offering them only by reminding the public and the legislature of the purpose of copyright and the opportunity for the open flow of information can we ensure that the public prevails
5419881 well we can do nothing about it so lets just live with it and blame the u s

5419892 the projections in the ocs access case indicate that access to the pacific atlantic and eastern gulf regions would not have a significant impact on domestic crude oil and natural gas production or prices before 2030 leasing would begin no sooner than 2012 and production would not be expected to start before 2017 total domestic production of crude oil from 2012 through 2030 in the ocs access case is projected to be 1 6 percent higher than in the reference case and 3 percent higher in 2030 alone at 5 6 million barrels per day for the lower 48 ocs annual crude oil production in 2030 is projected to be 7 percent higher 2 4 million barrels per day in the ocs access case compared with 2 2 million barrels per day in the reference case figure 20 because oil prices are determined on the international market however any impact on average wellhead prices is expected to be insignificant
5419893 does not support the hypothesis that the activity of these groups speculators is driving prices higher
5419894 there isnt anything the government can do to affect the price of oil in the short term

5419896 i cant think of any other place you need cursive as an adult other than to sign your name
5419897 cursive that is so low on the priority list we really could care less we are much more concerned that these kids pass their sols standardized tests and that doesnt require a bit of cursive
5419898 a lot of kids have just awful handwriting teachers dont take off points for poor handwriting
5419899 people are noticing that there are children who continue to struggle with their reading
5419900 and read 180 is a product that does target those upper elementary grades middle and high school there isnt as much available for the middle and high school as far as intervention programs as compared with what is available for the lower elementary grades

5419902 the computer gives them the reading the spelling and the word recognition at their level not their neighbors level

5419904 if a student doesnt read well if they dont understand what it is theyre reading thats hurting them in all their classes
5419905 if they dont understand what theyre reading every class is hard for them

5419929 reality had been constructed by the educated classes of society and that the perceptions of more marginal groups were mostly excluded from this reality

5419934 one national museums work to develop a new model of national service a work in progress
5419935 what makes this different from traditional field trips the philosophy of the program and why they do it the impact on the students teachers museum staff and parents and the role in the community

5419940 the links between sustainability in the brundtland commissions sense culture and the potential of museums as agents of social change
5419941 while museums can and should be addressing sustainability through the non formal education system they also have a broader role to play as active facilitators of social change at local and regional levels
5419942 m useums can help by encouraging people to become more conscious of critical relationships that link them to nature and to other people some of the roles that museums can play include being storytellers through non formal education providing sanctuaries that inspire reflection and acting as catalysts to spark needed social change

5419952 by stamping out illegal working we are making the uk a less attractive estination forillegal migration
5419953 the new civil penalties are a more effectve way of dealing with employers who use slipshod or exploitative recruitment methods
5419954 by working together with employers and others we have developed a system that delivers the migrants the uk needs but which also keeps out those that it does not
5419955 we employ staff from more than 100 nations so we often see people who do not have the right to work in this country trying to gain employment with very convincing forged documents we work closely with the home office to ensure our processes and procedures are kept up to date
5419956 illegal working cannot be tackled by the government alone and its every employers duty to ensure that they conduct the proper checks on prospective employees
5419957 illegal working exploits vulnerable people undermines fair business competition and the minimum wage and deprives the economy of tax and national insurance contributions these proposals will help ensure we close down illegal working and develop routes for employers to recruit legally the foreign workers they need to grow their businesses
5419958 we were initially working the problem purely from a power standpoint
